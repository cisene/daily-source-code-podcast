WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:26.020
Yeah, everybody. It's the Daily
Code. I'm Adam Curry and I'm
out some new

00:26.020 --> 00:31.160
software today for the, what the
was called, the show. First of
let me

00:31.160 --> 00:43.160
dog into the studio here. Come
Jess. Come on. Because the dog
to go outside. So I had put out
request for

00:43.160 --> 00:52.160
software that I could actually
these recordings with and plenty
suggestions. Nothing exactly
I wanted.

00:52.160 --> 01:03.160
One, a couple for GarageBand,
I did like. I did try out. And
know, you really can't do the
mix and

01:03.160 --> 01:05.160
starting stuff in.

01:04.500 --> 01:09.500
in starting songs and maybe
effects or audio bits.

01:09.500 --> 01:13.020
If it's a timeline based
editor,

01:13.020 --> 01:14.820
you really need just a couple of

01:14.820 --> 01:18.420
that you can assign to sound

01:18.420 --> 01:20.180
You have to be able to hit them

01:20.180 --> 01:23.420
and the output needs to be

01:23.420 --> 01:26.660
with the microphone channel into
MP3 file.

01:26.660 --> 01:28.060
What I did like about GarageBand

01:28.060 --> 01:31.220
was the great effects and the
effects

01:31.220 --> 01:34.380
that I could use on the

01:34.380 --> 01:37.500
Really sound good as opposed to
crappy sound

01:37.500 --> 01:39.020
that I have now.

01:39.020 --> 01:42.220
And I'm gonna explain a second
I'm using.

01:42.220 --> 01:43.500
Hold on a second.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.540
Dogs back in, would like to

01:48.000 --> 01:56.880
explain. There's a, what I call
studio is a bar in one far end
the house and there's a

01:56.880 --> 02:05.040
door open here that goes out
the back patio and into the
and Jesse, our biggest dog,

02:05.040 --> 02:12.560
knows that that's a quick way
All right, other suggestions
Audion,

02:13.840 --> 02:21.200
which again, you know, you can,
let you record an MP3 mix down,
playlist of songs

02:21.200 --> 02:25.840
mixed together, which you could
over, which isn't quite what I'm
for. Acoustica,

02:25.840 --> 02:31.440
which is something that Dave
on his site as a recommendation.
that's not what you're

02:31.440 --> 02:36.640
looking for when we're doing
kind of stuff. That's a timeline
recorder and editor,

02:36.640 --> 02:41.840
although great for pre-recording
and it's not really good for the
environment.

02:43.120 --> 02:46.320
And then it hit me that really,
so many different

02:46.320 --> 02:48.320
Um

02:48.320 --> 02:48.820
Um...

02:49.500 --> 02:54.780
applications that I use for
real-for-sound.

02:54.780 --> 03:04.720
I may use iTunes for one reason,
for some of the digital signal
features.

03:04.720 --> 03:09.420
I may just use a quick time
and other instances.

03:09.420 --> 03:16.780
I can create the mix on my
almost, because I have a program
will record

03:16.780 --> 03:18.260
my voice.

03:18.260 --> 03:25.140
Maybe what I'm looking for is
a very small application that
actually record

03:25.140 --> 03:31.020
a mic in channel or line in
a microphone channel, and then
else that's on

03:31.020 --> 03:32.020
the speakers.

03:32.020 --> 03:33.020
Anything.

03:33.020 --> 03:35.860
There's got to be a way to hook
that somehow and the poor audio
whatever it

03:35.860 --> 03:39.060
is on the Macintosh.

03:39.060 --> 03:45.820
Anyway, I finally wound up using
365 Live.

03:45.820 --> 03:50.980
I'm going to put a screenshot of
on my web log at live.curry.com.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.880
hum because that interface
shows what I'm talking about and
really really

03:55.880 --> 04:00.740
simple. There's a playlist
where you can put songs that
play in order or

04:00.740 --> 04:04.920
that's where I just store the
of the day. There's two what
call cart machines

04:04.920 --> 04:10.240
and you can load up an mp3 in
and hit a button that starts
and then

04:10.240 --> 04:15.240
there's a mic channel that you
on or off and you can set your
and that's

04:15.240 --> 04:21.080
basically it. The downside here
that I'm also pooping out 64
a second of

04:21.080 --> 04:28.080
whatever to live 365 server
they've already sent over 2
but it does

04:28.080 --> 04:35.880
let you record a copy of the
that you're sending up to their
as an mp3

04:35.880 --> 04:41.720
on your desktop. So that's how
doing it today and that's what
me the opportunity

04:41.720 --> 04:47.920
to play the song of the day
is something that's just perfect
a Sunday afternoon here

04:47.920 --> 04:52.480
in Belgium. It's sunny and the
nice.

04:52.500 --> 04:57.220
cool maybe for the summer but it
kind of gives you this type of
You just want

04:57.220 --> 04:59.500
to hear a little bit of the
things.

04:59.500 --> 05:13.500
I'm gonna bring your sides to
my eyes and shade to bring. I'm
dream in space.

05:13.500 --> 05:22.500
To each of you, go back, let's
What did you do there? What did
feel there?

05:22.500 --> 05:37.500
It's true, it's not the key is
It's hard to but it's hard, it's
to but it's hard

05:37.500 --> 05:54.500
to but it's hard to but it's
to but it's hard to but it's
to but it's hard to but it's

05:54.000 --> 06:11.000
I tell you what I do, I like to
there, I'll review you, you can
out school, what's that?

06:11.000 --> 06:37.000
Why go to learn the world of
world?

06:37.000 --> 06:48.000
It's all too beautiful to be
but you know my mind, it's not
for me to play slow about my

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
They all corrupt, you're not the
which my center path is free.

06:55.500 --> 07:14.920
It's all too beautiful, it's all
beautiful, it's all too
it's all too beautiful.

07:14.920 --> 07:25.500
It's all too beautiful, it's all
beautiful, it's all too

07:27.000 --> 07:46.200
Well it's all too beautiful.
your good part. Small faces.
at this. Apparently,

07:46.200 --> 07:54.360
the playlist is on repeat. Okay,
again, it's all about the
in this case,

07:54.360 --> 07:59.800
and a couple of other items in
news. I just want to talk about
One is that

07:59.800 --> 08:07.640
I woke up this morning and the
teletext, which is kind of like
newspaper on your

08:07.640 --> 08:12.480
TV. It's kind of like web pages.
all have a number and the signal
sent along

08:12.480 --> 08:17.720
with the television signal and
decoded. So you can actually
read text on your

08:17.720 --> 08:26.880
television, hence the name
that in Arumaita in Iraq, which
in the southwestern

08:26.880 --> 08:28.520
region where the Dutch troops
stationed.

08:28.500 --> 08:34.500
that last night one soldier was
four were seriously wounded.

08:34.500 --> 08:41.500
And the Folkskrant, which is one
the larger newspapers here,

08:41.500 --> 08:47.500
the very left wing, was the only
online with the story,

08:47.500 --> 08:49.500
see around 8 o'clock this

08:49.500 --> 08:54.500
And for hours, and I haven't
just recently now,

08:54.500 --> 08:57.500
it's at three in the afternoon,
know, there was nothing on

08:57.500 --> 09:01.500
or AP or Reuters, there was just
about it.

09:01.500 --> 09:08.500
And as a part of the coalition,
know, whether I agree with us
there or not,

09:08.500 --> 09:15.500
that sucked, you know, it's
hey, come on, aren't we a part
the whole global group here or

09:15.500 --> 09:22.500
And it also really hit home
I've been to that camp where
happened.

09:22.500 --> 09:29.500
So, and I do remember of all the
we took, we all collectively
felt that we were

09:30.000 --> 09:35.200
most unsafe there and we
did most of the walking there at
time and crossed

09:35.200 --> 09:43.520
a platoon bridge. I believe that
all in out of my town. And yeah,
was kind of shocking.

09:43.520 --> 09:54.960
It brings it all back. And
going on in Texas? The sixth
this year to die from the

09:54.960 --> 10:02.960
flesh-eating bacteria. This is,
know, this is worrisome. See,
guy was pretty young too.

10:02.960 --> 10:11.120
I think I was like 52 years old.
me see. Of course now I almost
no bandwidth left to

10:11.120 --> 10:17.760
surf to stuff because I'm
my signal up to a live 365. But,

10:17.760 --> 10:18.760
Bye.

10:21.000 --> 10:28.920
Okay, never mind that, but
case of this weird flesh-eating
apparently

10:28.920 --> 10:32.440
this guy, he was, I think it was
52 when he was a doctor.

10:32.440 --> 10:39.840
He cut himself boating and it
infected, they had to amputate
knee, blow the knee,

10:39.840 --> 10:41.480
and he died.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.720
The bacteria ate him up.

10:43.720 --> 10:49.120
I wouldn't mind knowing a little
more about that and how to avoid

10:49.120 --> 10:56.120
And finally I released the iPod
script today, released being a
word.

10:56.120 --> 11:03.280
But I got so fed up with just
this, I lost my scripts and
or compiled

11:03.280 --> 11:05.560
them incorrectly so I couldn't
the real source back.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.560
So I'd step back to a couple
ago which I'd saved.

11:08.560 --> 11:14.560
I've gotten much better at that
and I reconstruct what I had
and of course

11:14.560 --> 11:17.160
the script came out even better
it's working really nicely.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.160
I figured alright now is the
to get it out there.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.960
People look at it so you can

11:22.500 --> 11:25.180
What is I've been talking about?

11:25.180 --> 11:31.020
How I see a totally open market?

11:31.020 --> 11:35.780
Because I'm on a Mac, I did it
on a Mac, it works on a Mac, but
iPod is also kind

11:35.780 --> 11:36.780
of ours, right?

11:36.780 --> 11:41.820
It's not that we let them use it

11:41.820 --> 11:48.180
But just by connecting all these
I think it's really interesting
you fire

11:48.180 --> 11:51.780
the script up and it does all
work for you.

11:51.780 --> 11:58.440
All you have to know about as
who has an iPod and a Mac is
you receive new

11:58.440 --> 12:04.580
audio shows automatically, you
have to do anything, no
no transferring,

12:04.580 --> 12:08.380
just put your iPod in the dock
you're good to go.

12:08.380 --> 12:13.580
And there's a million different
that I could have done better in
script and

12:13.580 --> 12:17.860
it's not even really ready to
if you don't know what you're
in Apple Script.

12:17.860 --> 12:23.140
You have to change the folder
where you want all the file

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
Download with caution is a link
it on my on my web log and

12:28.000 --> 12:35.040
Tomorrow it's back to work again
more weeks of doing the morning
up until August 31st, and then

12:35.040 --> 12:38.640
That's it. I'll be a free man

12:38.640 --> 12:45.440
And looking forward to it, but
also have a lot of great guests
this week and I'm sure I'll
a lot as I

12:45.440 --> 12:49.440
chat with them every morning
6 to 9 a.m. And

12:49.440 --> 12:52.240
I'll be talking to you guys

12:52.360 --> 12:58.320
Probably right after each show
day. I was thinking maybe I'm
him on my commute back to

12:58.320 --> 13:02.040
Although doing all that with a
in the car is a

13:02.040 --> 13:05.040
challenging again

13:05.040 --> 13:09.440
Something to look at man, maybe
should I maybe I should do one
these while I'm flying home

13:09.440 --> 13:12.600
All right

13:12.600 --> 13:17.040
That's it for today. I'm going
leave you see how long I've been
this 13 minutes yet long enough

13:17.040 --> 13:21.200
I want to get I actually wanted
play the FCC song

13:21.200 --> 13:25.480
was it said Eric Idyllith?

13:25.500 --> 13:29.780
think from Monty Python because
don't know if everyone's heard
or not.

13:29.780 --> 13:31.820
But I'll just have to do that

13:31.820 --> 13:38.420
So this was my source code for
August 15, 2004.

13:38.420 --> 13:44.820
You can reach me at adam at
and my web log address is

13:44.820 --> 13:45.820
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
