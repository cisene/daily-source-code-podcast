WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.680
this is the source code for
August 26 2004. Hi everybody.
morning, good

00:15.680 --> 00:19.680
evening, good afternoon,
you might be listening to this
whichever day you

00:19.680 --> 00:24.520
might be listening to this. I'm
Curry coming to you from Curry
in Belgium

00:24.520 --> 00:29.080
for as long as we are still
The move towards the UK is
good. Hopefully

00:29.080 --> 00:35.840
we'll have some news about that
week. So it's Thursday is always
hardest day.

00:35.840 --> 00:42.200
If you get up really early like
been doing for the past year,
is just

00:42.200 --> 00:46.200
it's the Thursday dip. It's
really difficult. So just a
scan around the

00:46.200 --> 00:53.800
net a couple of things I want to
about today. After hearing Dan
on IT conversations,

00:53.800 --> 00:58.960
I'm relaying that the Halley
hosts. Dan posted something on
web blog that you

00:58.960 --> 01:01.480
might want to check out at

01:01.500 --> 01:03.600
concept of the iPod platform.

01:03.600 --> 01:09.180
And he writes about IT
and basically all the stuff that
been talking about,

01:09.180 --> 01:15.760
you know, how there are actual
and shows and how the timing of
you get it

01:15.760 --> 01:21.020
may not be that important as
as it's automated and put onto
play out device.

01:21.020 --> 01:24.780
And of course he does note that
technology to do this has been
for quite a while.

01:24.780 --> 01:31.020
But I think now we're finally
on and I'm very happy about

01:31.020 --> 01:35.780
Yesterday I started with the
of my reviews of audiobooks.

01:35.780 --> 01:38.780
So yesterday, what was it?

01:38.780 --> 01:40.620
Oh, anti-Americanism.

01:40.620 --> 01:46.380
And today a book that I read,
big quotes there on the red part
I listened to

01:46.380 --> 01:52.300
read all my books through almost
my books through audiobooks.

01:52.300 --> 01:55.660
I thought it might be
to let you hear what it sounds
when audiobook

01:55.660 --> 01:58.140
has been read by the author.

01:58.140 --> 02:02.780
In this case, Bill Clinton, his
My Little

02:03.000 --> 02:09.480
life, which I was thinking about
I was preparing a clip to play
you today, that

02:09.480 --> 02:13.080
I don't think that I would have
able to get through the entire
if I was actually

02:13.080 --> 02:19.960
reading it. Because I found it,
know, a little bit boring. The
the press in Europe

02:19.960 --> 02:23.520
certainly played it up is, you
well, there's not much in the
but there is

02:23.520 --> 02:28.400
this one bit about Monica
And it's dumb, you know, it's
to hear

02:28.400 --> 02:32.920
about what went on behind the
how policy was put together. I
like

02:32.920 --> 02:40.560
the all the stories about his
election. And just a lot of the

02:40.560 --> 02:47.840
that he had to make during his
and also before and after. But
it may be

02:47.840 --> 02:52.560
because you're listening to the
of the United States read these
or speak

02:52.560 --> 02:56.920
these words that it is
enough to listen to the entire
But it's certainly

02:56.920 --> 03:00.880
not one that, you know, excuse
I'm yeah, I know I have to take
bath, but I'm taking

03:00.880 --> 03:01.880
the iPod with me.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.680
It's not a book like that.

03:04.500 --> 03:09.420
part for you today and I'm going
try and keep a little bit
than the previous

03:09.420 --> 03:15.860
excerpts I've done, where Bill
talks about the fact that he
that he was lying

03:15.860 --> 03:23.340
and that he was betraying his
his family and of course the
public.

03:23.340 --> 03:30.420
And it is nice to hear someone
you know, I fucked up and I did
bad thing.

03:30.420 --> 03:34.520
So I'll play that for you right
from Bill Clinton's My Life.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
broke, I called my attorney
Kendall and assured him that I
not sub-orn perjury

03:40.000 --> 03:45.120
or obstructed justice. It was
to both of us that Starr was
to create a firestorm

03:45.120 --> 03:50.440
to force me from office. He was
to a flying start, but I thought
I could survive the

03:50.440 --> 03:54.880
public pounding for two weeks,
smoke would begin to clear the
and the public would

03:54.880 --> 04:01.080
focus on Starr's tactics, and a
balanced view would emerge. I
I had made a terrible

04:01.080 --> 04:07.000
mistake, and I was determined
to compound it by allowing Starr
drive me from office.

04:07.000 --> 04:14.800
For now, the hysteria was
I went on doing my job, and I
denying

04:14.800 --> 04:20.160
what had happened to everyone.
Chelsea, my staff and cabinet,
friends in Congress,

04:20.160 --> 04:25.360
members of the press and the
people. What I regret most other
my conduct is

04:25.360 --> 04:31.440
having misled all of them. Since
I had been called a liar about
under

04:31.440 --> 04:36.920
the sun, when in fact, I had
honest in my public life and
affairs, as all

04:37.500 --> 04:43.980
would show. Now I was misleading
about my personal failing. I was
embarrassed

04:43.980 --> 04:48.180
and I wanted to keep it for my
and daughter and I didn't want
help Ken Star to criminalize

04:48.180 --> 04:54.820
my personal life. It was like
in a nightmare. I was back to my
lives

04:54.820 --> 04:55.820
with the vengeance.

04:55.820 --> 05:04.220
Okay, Bill Clinton from my life
I purchased it on audible.com.
getting paid to say

05:04.220 --> 05:10.980
this but that is a good place to
the most recent audible
And it's recently

05:10.980 --> 05:15.980
simple. Although you do have to
in every single time you come
which is pain in

05:15.980 --> 05:23.900
the ass and sometimes you know
session expires. Oh well. I want
move on to talk

05:23.900 --> 05:30.540
about Dave Sluscher's most
work on the iPod platform and
audio post. But first

05:30.540 --> 05:36.620
I've gotten several messages
iTunes for Windows because
have been working

05:36.620 --> 05:38.980
on Windows scripts. Dave
also has created a new version
the Internet.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.600
created a Windows version of his
script of the getenclosures.pl
has the same

05:45.600 --> 05:51.040
functionality as iPod or only
it's better and I'm using it

05:51.040 --> 05:55.840
But apparently iTunes for
which you can of course use to
up your iPod.

05:55.840 --> 05:59.480
I haven't done it myself but I
it's more or less the same where
dock your

05:59.480 --> 06:02.960
iPod and it syncs up with your
library.

06:02.960 --> 06:08.080
Apparently there's a calm object
iTunes which means you can
it and this was

06:08.080 --> 06:13.440
pointed out to me by several
and therefore I guess it's
or addressable or you

06:13.440 --> 06:14.640
can talk to it.

06:14.640 --> 06:19.040
So if you're interested in
with us and helping out that
would be a

06:19.040 --> 06:23.440
big help if we can figure out
what we can make iTunes do and
it will only

06:23.440 --> 06:29.800
sync with an iPod or if we can
some of its API to connect to
devices because

06:29.800 --> 06:32.920
iPods, yeah there's millions of
out there but they're certainly
the only ones

06:32.920 --> 06:35.400
nor should they be.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.440
Is there some kind of industry
for that?

06:37.440 --> 06:39.560
I mean has anyone even looked
it?

06:40.500 --> 06:45.500
I know I'll look into myself
as well.

06:45.500 --> 06:51.500
So Dave Slusher from

06:51.500 --> 06:54.820
who's also a radio guy, I know
discovered

06:54.820 --> 06:58.640
from his most recent audio post.

06:58.640 --> 07:02.940
He did an entire 21 minute piece
RSS and enclosures

07:02.940 --> 07:06.540
and monetizing on it and how
would work.

07:06.540 --> 07:08.580
And I agree with him on a lot of

07:08.580 --> 07:09.580
and he's saying some really...

07:09.580 --> 07:13.180
I don't know if you guys heard

07:13.180 --> 07:15.700
but my eye chat just started
to me.

07:15.700 --> 07:18.860
He's saying a lot of intelligent

07:18.860 --> 07:21.900
about the asynchronous nature of
iPod platform.

07:21.900 --> 07:26.220
And I think the monetizing bit

07:26.220 --> 07:27.500
where he's talking about

07:27.500 --> 07:29.700
he's talking about being paid
download.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.180
I don't wanna go quite that far.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.020
I think it's, yeah, sponsorship
come into play.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.180
Maybe someone will say, hey,
you let us sponsor

07:37.180 --> 07:41.980
your review of audiobooks.

07:42.000 --> 07:52.700
And one of the reasons I'm doing
not only do I like audiobooks,
I'm sure that there's a market
for people to get reviews about
and here if it's worth worth

07:52.700 --> 08:11.800
What we will need a better way
measuring our success and I, you
yes, there is a pretty broad
and belief in measurement of
views, you need visits with, you
based on server logs, but
still.

08:11.800 --> 08:26.800
There's a lot of caching going
and, you know, and quite frankly
are passed on through other
than hitting the same web
you know, they're relayed from
aggregator to someone's web log.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.200
They're sent via email.

08:28.200 --> 08:35.300
There's so many different ways
it can get, you know, that your
or your content network spreads

08:35.300 --> 08:42.300
So we need a better way of
that and I think that will
come back to a, you know, your
did you get some sales?

08:42.300 --> 08:43.560
sales.

08:43.500 --> 08:49.340
very basic. That is absolutely
most basic way of broadcast
I think it's

08:49.340 --> 08:59.340
called per inquiry. You used to
it a lot at night and probably
on most local stations.

08:59.340 --> 09:04.420
There's a phone number, you call
you order something and then the
gets a

09:04.420 --> 09:08.660
piece of each sale and of course
person who put together the
or whatever

09:08.660 --> 09:15.700
it is. That's called per
I think that that may be a way
go.

09:15.700 --> 09:21.820
Another thing that Dave Sluscher
about is how this asynchronous
is giving us

09:21.820 --> 09:27.980
the power to really listen to
he calls I think packets of
I'll check an

09:27.980 --> 09:34.660
excerpt in a second. We do have
over what we like and so that we
watch it when

09:34.660 --> 09:42.900
we want to and we don't have to
12 a day for 12 consecutive
to make sure

09:42.900 --> 09:45.020
we don't miss any episode of the

09:45.000 --> 09:50.680
of pranos, which gets me to
we need some kind of democratic
engine, you know,

09:50.680 --> 09:57.120
so something that can be as
as Tivo can be based upon all of
behavior anonymously

09:57.120 --> 10:00.760
and that no one controls and can
and monetize on that.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.960
Because I don't think that's
the money is going to be, by the

10:02.960 --> 10:04.520
That's the old way of figuring
out.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.800
I think that they're going to be

10:05.800 --> 10:12.600
If people are going to sponsor
and want to be a part of
communication.

10:12.600 --> 10:19.120
Anyway, let's have a listen to
Slusher because he did figure me

10:19.120 --> 10:24.440
He really understands why I
the iPod or Apple script and
just share with

10:24.440 --> 10:28.560
you because he has a pretty good
for it.

10:28.560 --> 10:35.040
So as we as has been going on
Adam Curry's web log and some of
other people,

10:35.040 --> 10:39.360
he wrote his iPod or script
sort of challenged a couple
people to it was

10:39.360 --> 10:44.040
kind of Tom Sawyer, whitewashing
fence sort of ploy, challenged
of us,

10:44.040 --> 10:46.500
being us to go out and do, you

10:46.500 --> 10:52.500
more fuller featured versions of
same thing, you know, having
a little bit of it.

10:52.500 --> 10:59.500
And making it think it's all our
So there is certainly a Mark
sort of feel to it.

10:59.500 --> 11:06.500
Okay, you got me. Yes, exactly
plan. And I'm very happy it's
I'm great that we're working

11:06.500 --> 11:11.500
even though we haven't even, I
really exchange an email. And
other people out there,

11:11.500 --> 11:17.500
and they're posting stuff, their
and they've got all kinds of
And that's very cool.

11:17.500 --> 11:24.500
And just one more bit of what I
it. Some of Dave's personality.
I'm trying to figure him out,

11:24.500 --> 11:31.500
just from listening to his audio
posts. You can get a real good
of what someone's about

11:31.500 --> 11:35.500
and where they're coming from.
I think he has a real problem
the record industry,

11:35.500 --> 11:40.500
and maybe just with the man in
So that was the wrong one. Here
go.

11:40.500 --> 11:44.500
And really, um, fucked it up.
such a great intro for you,
Here we go.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.500
And really and truly the more I
that's the best.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.260
think about it, this iPod
and kind of asynchronously
for offline

11:53.260 --> 11:58.700
consumption these bundles of
is so much better than streaming

11:58.700 --> 12:04.180
And so I'm again, I'm hoping for
world of delicious irony whereby
around

12:04.180 --> 12:09.140
and making it so that internet
was not economically viable.

12:09.140 --> 12:15.540
They brought about a world with
with much worse potential, much
potential

12:15.540 --> 12:18.800
for changing the world.

12:18.800 --> 12:25.980
And hopefully for reducing the
labels role in it, for
themselves

12:25.980 --> 12:31.220
out of existence because they're
cock suckers and such greedy
that they cannot

12:31.220 --> 12:39.260
possibly allow any other
model come in that may anytime
or in the future ever

12:39.260 --> 12:40.980
compete with them.

12:40.980 --> 12:45.860
So these fucking plutocrats may
really really host themselves
so politically

12:45.860 --> 12:47.700
I kind of hoping that that's the

12:47.700 --> 12:49.300
But anyway, I'm getting out.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.500
The synchronous is the key.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
OK.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.380
My audio cut out once or twice
that.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.060
I don't know if that actually
out that way

12:56.060 --> 12:59.180
on the recording, but clearly
passionate about what's

12:59.180 --> 13:01.900
going on in the music industry.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.260
And I think that the music
actually

13:03.260 --> 13:06.260
has a way to help us, which I
to get to in a second.

13:06.260 --> 13:08.900
Just some quick emails and

13:08.900 --> 13:14.060
on the web log that I wanted to
with you.

13:14.060 --> 13:18.500
Because I'd asked several of
where do you listen

13:18.500 --> 13:20.660
to the source code?

13:20.660 --> 13:21.740
What are you working on?

13:21.740 --> 13:25.020
Actually, Peter Oferbakke.

13:25.020 --> 13:29.980
He has a web log at
slash WordPress.

13:29.980 --> 13:33.820
It's iPortunities with double P.
he's

13:33.820 --> 13:39.260
talking about working on a
version of iPotter

13:39.260 --> 13:43.100
that will work on Windows.

13:43.100 --> 13:43.580
Let's see.

13:43.580 --> 13:47.420
Then we have Eric Rice, who says
he not only

13:47.420 --> 13:51.020
listens to the show when he's
but he also replied via his

13:51.000 --> 13:54.840
blog. I look for it but for some
I couldn't find it so I have to
that again Eric.

13:54.840 --> 14:04.840
And Ed also says that there's a
you can use the B script and of
the window scheduler

14:04.840 --> 14:12.440
to accomplish the iPod or stuff.
he points to WarnerFogel's .net
which he had up in

14:12.440 --> 14:16.680
back in October. I think that we
need to connect to iTunes.
the magic piece. It's

14:16.680 --> 14:23.160
not just downloading the files
extracting the enclosures. It's
the final last bits

14:23.160 --> 14:28.680
there is getting it on to the
without any user intervention.
we've really created

14:28.680 --> 14:36.120
something. And Tim Watt who has
radio web blog but just Google
named Tim Watt WATT.

14:36.120 --> 14:42.680
He is blogging the Olympics. I
think that they were allowed to
that and he seems

14:42.680 --> 14:47.560
like he's a journalist himself.
certainly has all kinds of great
and fabulous

14:47.560 --> 14:52.360
pictures and stories on his on
web blog. And I was in the

14:52.500 --> 14:56.340
that no one was allowed to blog
at the Olympics.

14:56.340 --> 15:03.580
Maybe he's just hanging out, but
from England and judging from
blog, he's definitely

15:03.580 --> 15:05.100
a journalist.

15:05.100 --> 15:10.840
He said that he's been listening
the show while he's been there
the last week or

15:10.840 --> 15:15.100
so on the new transport system
Athens.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.100
Going back and forth from the
center each night.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.100
So there you go.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.140
That says a lot about his

15:20.140 --> 15:21.740
He says, I'm going to quote him

15:21.740 --> 15:24.820
I think the Lavino Rolos is
that you've played.

15:24.820 --> 15:29.100
You'll have a special nostalgia
me in the future with the
of cicadas and hot

15:29.100 --> 15:31.380
weather when he's back in rainy
England.

15:31.380 --> 15:36.620
So wow, you know, I reached out
touched someone with the audio
and welcome and

15:36.620 --> 15:39.300
thanks for listening, Tim.

15:39.300 --> 15:44.020
So let me wind up with me the
of the day.

15:44.020 --> 15:48.660
I was thinking that it would be
if we can get the music business
somehow.

15:48.660 --> 15:53.500
And there's one guy and actually
believe Dave Weiner suggested it
me a while ago.

15:54.000 --> 16:01.360
who would at least understand
we're trying to do and see that
something there

16:01.360 --> 16:06.560
that needs to be built and can
done and that you don't
have to monitor

16:06.560 --> 16:12.560
it on a better way. And I'll
you a little story about him
this song.

16:12.560 --> 16:28.480
You sign of the times, it's

16:28.480 --> 16:40.640

a needle and soon changed it the

Best with your mind, for the
who live, this fall in love, you
have a break, call it late.

19:30.900 --> 19:43.020
It's a bull. Time, time.

19:43.020 --> 19:49.300
That's Prince, sign of the times
I want to tell you why I think
he would be great to work on

19:49.300 --> 19:53.780
First of all, we already know he
in a download platform and a
for downloads because

19:53.780 --> 19:58.780
he's one of the first musicians
really dive into that head
Check out

19:58.780 --> 20:03.020
Secondly, he's very intelligent
very wired and knows exactly
he's doing.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.100
what's going on and it's very

20:05.100 --> 20:07.760
And I can attest to that because
met him

20:07.760 --> 20:10.740
and was invited to Paisley Park

20:10.740 --> 20:14.140
I was in Minneapolis doing a
for,

20:14.140 --> 20:18.980
yeah, of course, Sam Goody's
land.

20:18.980 --> 20:22.700
And it was like a three or four
shoot

20:22.700 --> 20:24.540
and on the second or third day

20:24.540 --> 20:28.860
in the quarter to 12, he almost

20:28.860 --> 20:31.860
There was, you know, got a phone

20:31.860 --> 20:33.260
and someone said, hey, you know,

20:33.260 --> 20:36.900
Prince has a little party going
at the studios.

20:36.900 --> 20:37.740
Do you want to come?

20:37.740 --> 20:39.180
And that's where Paisley Park
are

20:39.180 --> 20:41.700
and that's where Prince's from
Cities.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.700
And so, you know, are you

20:43.700 --> 20:45.260
And I said, well, let me think.

20:45.260 --> 20:46.660
Yeah.

20:46.660 --> 20:47.500
And I said, well, great,

20:47.500 --> 20:49.260
because the car is waiting

20:49.260 --> 20:50.660
All right, this is cool.

20:50.660 --> 20:54.620
So, hopping the car, go over and
about,

20:54.620 --> 20:56.620
I guess it was a 35 minute

20:56.620 --> 20:58.980
And then all of a sudden there's
Park,

20:58.980 --> 21:03.700
all lit up in purple, you know,
of sitting up on a hillside.

21:04.500 --> 21:07.800
through beautiful white metal

21:07.800 --> 21:10.780
There's very indirect lighting

21:10.780 --> 21:14.600
and ushered into a room which
probably,

21:14.600 --> 21:21.460
I don't know, maybe half a
field.

21:21.460 --> 21:25.040
And there was nothing but
people there.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.100
And there was all kinds of
tunes

21:27.100 --> 21:28.860
that I'd never heard before.

21:28.860 --> 21:32.260
All kinds of incredible stuff
DJ playing them live

21:32.260 --> 21:34.580
from CDs and mini discs and, you

21:34.580 --> 21:38.420
clearly all kinds of unreleased
material.

21:38.420 --> 21:41.100
It was great, all kinds of
food set to one side.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.900
Everybody and, you know, nice,

21:42.900 --> 21:45.700
everything was white and
dressed nicely.

21:45.700 --> 21:48.540
And Prince was over there
by a sound stack

21:48.540 --> 21:52.460
or actually the speakers behind
speakers.

21:52.460 --> 21:54.220
Just kind of checking everyone
and I said,

21:54.220 --> 21:56.220
you know, I gotta go over and
to him.

21:56.220 --> 21:57.620
No, no, no, you can't do that.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.660
What do you mean I can't do

21:59.660 --> 22:02.340
Well, you know, like you're
tall and you're white.

22:02.340 --> 22:03.940
I'm like, fuck you.

22:03.940 --> 22:05.740
They invited me, I'm well, thank
for inviting me.

22:06.000 --> 22:13.560
to win over and first of all
not as small as you think he is
that's that's like an urban
he is and he wasn't a

22:13.560 --> 22:19.760
checked you know it wasn't like
was wearing extremely high heels
just from what I'd heard about
I expect him to be

22:19.760 --> 22:26.840
really small and I'm six three
six yeah six four and just isn't
like that

22:26.840 --> 22:35.080
and he knew he'd been watching
he knew what the latest shows
that I'd done and we talked
music and

22:35.080 --> 22:44.320
talked about Europe and you know
thanked him for you know for
me to this place and yeah you
he's he was just

22:44.320 --> 22:54.100
really much more normal guy than
would think or maybe he comes
in his performance and even I
maybe I'm more

22:54.100 --> 23:01.740
blasay than next but I was
surprised and you know then I
back had a drink turned around I
see him

23:01.740 --> 23:07.220
and half an hour later or maybe
was an hour and a half later you
party was over and that

23:07.500 --> 23:12.620
is indicated by the security
coming in and just kind of
flashing their

23:12.620 --> 23:16.540
flashlights on the ground, just
of flashing around everyone
oh it's time to go,

23:16.540 --> 23:21.980
and the music goes down a little
and level, and we all walk out
the metal detector again,

23:21.980 --> 23:24.860
and I was driven home.

23:27.000 --> 23:34.000
my Prince story for you. And who
maybe someone will hear this and
say, you know,

23:34.000 --> 23:39.500
yo, Prince, his royal badness,
going on on the internet. You
want to check

23:39.500 --> 23:45.500

Okay, I'm going to get this up
the server. Tomorrow

14th birthday. So I will be
