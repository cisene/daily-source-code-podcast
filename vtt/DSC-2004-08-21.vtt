WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:10.440
The Power of Source Code

00:10.440 --> 00:19.540
Yeah, hi everybody, it's Source
It is Saturday, August 21st,
I'm Adam Curry.

00:19.540 --> 00:27.240
Saturday afternoon in Curry
in Belgium. It's about 3.36.
that for an approximate time for

00:27.240 --> 00:35.360
Sorry about yesterday. No
on the blog and no source code.
was just way too crazy.

00:35.360 --> 00:39.760
During the radio show in the
as you know, we're winding down.

00:40.160 --> 00:44.500
One more week to go and then two
days to finish up the month and
be all over.

00:44.500 --> 00:50.920
We had the Chanuk crew who flew
in Iraq.

00:50.920 --> 01:03.020
They flew us from Camp Smitty to

01:04.500 --> 01:07.620
a final two or three hour drive
there to Kuwait on our way home.

01:07.620 --> 01:12.080
And we also did some night
vision reconnaissance flights.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.300
So anyway, they came by.

01:13.300 --> 01:17.400
They wanted to see where we
since we'd already seen their
of responsibility.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.300
It was a good time, but tiring

01:20.300 --> 01:22.700
From there, I went straight

01:22.700 --> 01:29.940
There was someone who almost
immediately for an interview,
was, of course, all

01:29.940 --> 01:30.300
set up.

01:30.300 --> 01:34.100
But I keep forgetting I really
like doing stuff on Friday

01:34.960 --> 01:41.120
And then on top of that, some
who had seen the house earlier
the week came back,

01:41.120 --> 01:41.920
wanted to see it again.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.520
This time they brought the
family.

01:43.520 --> 01:49.420
And I got a call earlier this
that they are coming back again
Monday.

01:49.420 --> 01:50.680
So that looks good.

01:52.500 --> 02:03.780
I don't know if you remember,
days ago I mentioned that
my assistant, had...

02:03.780 --> 02:06.760
I'm not quite sure where she got
from.

02:06.760 --> 02:16.460
She got one of these Pinnacle
Show Center, which is
a video device that you hook up
your television.

02:16.460 --> 02:18.840
I have it hooked up to our big
View screen here.

02:19.660 --> 02:23.980
It has a Wi-Fi card, so it talks
your Wi-Fi environment.

02:23.980 --> 02:32.860
And it sits there basically
for a show center server, which
not quite sure what protocol it

02:32.860 --> 02:35.500
It may be Windows Media Server,
not sure.

02:35.500 --> 02:42.100
But that has to run on a Windows
so I still have an old Sony VAIO
with Windows 2000.

02:42.100 --> 02:45.840
Loaded it up, and lo and behold,
working.

02:45.840 --> 02:49.500
First of all, regarding the...

02:49.500 --> 02:50.040
the setup

02:50.040 --> 02:51.420
the wifi setup

02:51.420 --> 02:52.000
is stupid

02:52.000 --> 02:53.060
you have to fill in

02:54.000 --> 03:00.420
name, a network name, and it
with a show center as the
name installed

03:00.420 --> 03:03.280
standard, which makes no sense
of course, that means everyone's
to have

03:03.280 --> 03:03.960
to change that.

03:03.960 --> 03:08.760
Either you have to change your
network name or you have to
out how to change

03:08.760 --> 03:15.280
it on the show center device,
means you've got to reboot, hold
the B key.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.940
I mean, this is all stuff that
just not easy for people.

03:17.940 --> 03:19.740
I think it should work like my
does.

03:19.740 --> 03:24.640
When I walk in range of a new
network, it says, hey, should I
this?

03:24.640 --> 03:25.720
Do you want to connect to it

03:25.720 --> 03:28.140
That, of course, is the way this
work as well.

03:28.140 --> 03:33.840
So basically, you create a
in the show center software on
PC.

03:33.840 --> 03:41.680
Of course, just like a share
like a peer-to-peer program, if
want, it'll

03:41.680 --> 03:45.960
go through your entire disk and
up all kinds of media files.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.360
So that works pretty

03:48.360 --> 03:49.360
And it's basically...

03:49.360 --> 03:52.240
Basically, you have three bins,
movies, photos.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.960
You can create playlists from

03:55.500 --> 03:58.160
is the files that it will

03:58.160 --> 04:00.800
Let me see.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.800
I think I have...

04:01.800 --> 04:06.980
Here, it does tell me which
it'll accept.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.760
Hold on.

04:10.500 --> 04:23.840
mp3 windows media audio wave
jpeg png gif mpeg1 mpeg2 divx
version 5 plus 4 plus 5

04:23.840 --> 04:33.540
simple profile remember that is
video avi simple profile dv avi
media video video files

04:33.540 --> 04:39.080
also must all contain audio data
so apparently there's a quite a
between

04:39.080 --> 04:46.860
avis and avis because some
i had this huge bucket of bit
downloads which

04:46.860 --> 04:53.740
are either mpegs or avis and
of the avis do work on the show
if you put it in a

04:53.740 --> 05:03.160
windows media video it converts
to a vcd file you know so it's a
bit disappointing that

05:03.160 --> 05:08.700
you just don't know exactly what
going to work or not and if you
convert prior to

05:08.700 --> 05:10.260
putting it into this database

05:10.260 --> 05:12.000
or if it

05:12.000 --> 05:13.720
will do it by itself. It's very

05:13.720 --> 05:17.960
Something it does have that's
cool is you can

05:17.960 --> 05:19.820
set up a folder to be watched

05:19.820 --> 05:21.860
and the minute you drop

05:21.860 --> 05:23.840
anything into that folder,

05:23.840 --> 05:26.080
it will be added to the database
then

05:26.080 --> 05:27.900
from the control center, the
center

05:27.900 --> 05:29.740
in the living room, which has a
control,

05:29.740 --> 05:31.920
makes it nice, you can already

05:31.920 --> 05:34.100
a little light pops on saying
media

05:34.100 --> 05:35.820
and you go to the new media menu

05:35.820 --> 05:37.540
it will show up and it will

05:37.540 --> 05:39.900
Essentially when you select new
to be played

05:39.900 --> 05:41.560
it's being streamed across

05:41.560 --> 05:43.020
my Wi-Fi network.

05:43.020 --> 05:45.140
So I'm going to play with it a
bit more

05:45.140 --> 05:47.740
and I'm interested to see how

05:47.740 --> 05:50.060
Tricia, my wife, and Christina,
daughter

05:50.060 --> 05:51.060
how they pick it up

05:51.060 --> 05:54.020
and how they use it and I'm
mounted

05:54.020 --> 05:55.940
volumes on their

05:55.940 --> 05:57.840
computer desktops so they can

05:57.840 --> 05:59.500
drag and drop stuff in there as

05:59.500 --> 06:01.580
So we'll see what happens. It'll
cool.

06:01.580 --> 06:06.880
Right.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.860
I told you that I've been

06:09.860 --> 06:11.120
...

06:11.120 --> 06:13.500
That would be big quotation

06:13.500 --> 06:15.740
Michael Crichton's Timeline.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.880
The reason why I say reading

06:17.880 --> 06:19.740
is because I've been listening
it on audiobook.

06:19.740 --> 06:22.260
I actually just finished it
afternoon

06:22.260 --> 06:24.260
on my drive home, sitting in
extra traffic.

06:24.260 --> 06:28.020
So I even was able to finish up

06:28.020 --> 06:29.440
the last 25 minutes I thought

06:29.440 --> 06:31.760
I wouldn't be able to listen to
my drive home.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.060
Great book.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.000
Really enjoyed it.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.260
14 hours worth of audio.

06:37.260 --> 06:40.020
And I got an email from Dave

06:40.020 --> 06:41.420
Let me just pick that up here.

06:41.420 --> 06:46.440
FYI, I've become a member of

06:46.440 --> 06:47.780
and am reading

06:47.780 --> 06:49.520
Timeline now as I drive.

06:49.520 --> 06:50.620
He's driving across country.

06:50.620 --> 06:53.480
It's a very nice, if somewhat
service.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.880
I guess he's referring to...

06:55.880 --> 06:58.380
He could be referring to the
or to audible.com.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.200
Thanks for the tip in your audio
post.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.220
Next stop, St. Augustine.

07:02.220 --> 07:02.780
Dave.

07:02.780 --> 07:03.220
Okay.

07:03.220 --> 07:06.460
So there's something

07:06.460 --> 07:08.560
I was talking about the

07:08.560 --> 07:11.400
I think what I even said is...

07:11.400 --> 07:15.000
Gee, wouldn't it be cool if I
attach one of those DRM

07:15.000 --> 07:21.860
protected audio files, because
uses the AAC, Apple, DRM, can't
me stuff.

07:21.860 --> 07:26.160
And if you tried to open it in
just by double clicking it, it
then say, hey,

07:26.160 --> 07:31.240
you know, you want to buy this
Looks like Adam referred it to
Of course, they have a

07:31.240 --> 07:38.340
number, it's DRM, so they know
I bought it. And maybe they
give me two bucks for selling

07:38.340 --> 07:44.040
another copy, because I think it
for, I don't know, it goes for
least $10. What I want to do

07:44.040 --> 07:49.880
today, though, is share with you
little piece from that book, a
which I found very

07:49.880 --> 07:59.840
interesting and very applicable
perhaps the reason why we have
today. Now, if you're

07:59.840 --> 08:05.420
reading this book still and
want to hear any parts of it,
you should probably not listen

08:05.420 --> 08:11.900
to this. It's definitely not a
doesn't mess you up at all about
plot or the outcome

08:11.900 --> 08:14.020
of the book. But it's a
by one of my friends, and I'm
to share with you a little

08:14.020 --> 08:16.500
one of the characters and he's
doing

08:16.500 --> 08:24.860
a pitch for this vision that he
which is irrelevant, but listen
the theory behind

08:24.860 --> 08:25.300
the pitch.

08:25.300 --> 08:30.380
Now, of course, since this is an
file, I can't open it in any
application but

08:30.380 --> 08:30.840
iTunes.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.080
I tried to open it in QuickTime,
work either.

08:33.080 --> 08:38.260
So I can't open it into my
application, so I'm going to
to put the mic down on

08:38.260 --> 08:42.760
the speaker so that I can start
iTunes and you can listen to

08:42.760 --> 08:45.540
This is about three minutes, but
a very interesting thing.

08:45.540 --> 08:47.040
Hi.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.560
He walked back and forth across
stage.

08:56.560 --> 09:01.640
Today, everybody expects to be
and they expect to be
all the time.

09:01.640 --> 09:08.140
Business meetings must be
with bullet lists and animated
so executives aren't bored.

09:08.140 --> 09:13.240
Malls and stores must be
so they amuse as well as sell

09:13.240 --> 09:18.680
Politicians must have pleasing
personalities and tell us only
we want to hear.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.580
Schools must be careful not to
young minds that expect the
and complexity of television.

09:24.580 --> 09:29.320
Students must be amused,
must be amused, or they will

09:29.320 --> 09:32.780
Switch brands, switch channels,
parties, switch loyalties.

09:32.780 --> 09:38.360
This is the intellectual reality
Western society at the end of
century.

09:38.360 --> 09:44.960
In other centuries, human beings
to be saved, or improved, or
or educated.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.560
But in our century, they want to
entertained.

09:48.340 --> 09:52.680
The great fear is not of disease
death, but of boredom.

09:52.680 --> 09:55.440
A sense of time on our hands.

09:55.500 --> 10:00.000
a sense of nothing to do, a
that we are not amused.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.800
But where will this mania for
end?

10:03.800 --> 10:09.240
What will people do when they
tired of television, when they
tired of movies?

10:09.240 --> 10:11.180
We already know the answer.

10:11.180 --> 10:17.700
They go into participatory
sports, theme parks, amusement
roller coasters,

10:17.700 --> 10:21.660
structured fun, planned thrills.

10:21.660 --> 10:26.280
And what will they do when they
of theme parks and planned

10:26.280 --> 10:30.380
Sooner or later, the artifice
too noticeable.

10:30.380 --> 10:37.880
They begin to realize that an
park is really a kind of jail in
you pay to be an inmate.

10:37.880 --> 10:41.860
This artifice will drive them to
authenticity.

10:41.860 --> 10:47.580
Authenticity will be the
of the 21st century.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.120
And what is authentic?

10:50.120 --> 10:51.600
Anything.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.520
Anything that is not devised and
to make a profit.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.000
Anything that is not controlled
control.

10:57.000 --> 11:04.760
corporations, anything that
for its own sake, that assumes
own shape. But of course,

11:04.760 --> 11:10.820
nothing in the modern world is
to assume its own shape. The
world is the corporate

11:10.820 --> 11:17.740
equivalent of a formal garden,
everything is planted and
for effect, where nothing is

11:17.740 --> 11:27.440
untouched, where nothing is
Where, then, will people turn
the rare and desirable

11:27.440 --> 11:38.460
experience of authenticity? They
turn to the past. The past is
authentic.

11:38.460 --> 11:47.500
The past is a world that already
before Disney and Murdoch and
and Sony and IBM

11:47.500 --> 11:47.720
and Amazon.

11:47.740 --> 11:55.000
All the other shapers of the
day. The past was here before
were. The past rose

11:55.000 --> 11:58.500
and fell without their intrusion
molding and

11:58.500 --> 12:00.640
selling. The past is

12:00.640 --> 12:02.980
real. It's authentic.

12:02.980 --> 12:04.560
And this will

12:04.560 --> 12:06.560
make the past unbelievably

12:06.560 --> 12:08.180
attractive.

12:08.180 --> 12:10.280
Well, that's

12:10.280 --> 12:11.820
probably about enough of that.

12:11.820 --> 12:14.840
And hopefully it sounded okay
my

12:14.840 --> 12:18.660
air-based audio bridge.

12:18.660 --> 12:20.540
So I thought that was just an

12:20.540 --> 12:22.040
interesting bit of monologue.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.560
One about how people were going
look for

12:24.560 --> 12:26.860
reality. And maybe that's what

12:26.860 --> 12:28.640
bring if you subscribe to that

12:28.640 --> 12:30.840
type of vision. That weblogs

12:30.840 --> 12:32.520
bring a sense of reality. Or

12:32.520 --> 12:34.720
multiple weblogs can triangulate

12:34.720 --> 12:36.600
reality. And the whole

12:36.600 --> 12:38.160
bit about the past, who knows?

12:38.160 --> 12:40.380
Maybe that's what archives are
about.

12:40.380 --> 12:43.560
So what else?

12:43.560 --> 12:44.680
um...

12:46.500 --> 12:52.040
iPodder update, the application
turns your iPod into an audio
aggregator.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.380
So the current status is you
it up manually.

12:56.380 --> 13:01.400
It sucks in about six different
and updates your iTunes.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.000
And if you have it, an iPod

13:04.000 --> 13:13.440
I'm going to be working on the
release where there will be a
text file sitting in the iPodder

13:13.440 --> 13:15.160
And that's going to be your
file.

13:15.300 --> 13:22.660
So all you do is basically just
a new line with a URL to it to
MP3 enclosure feed with MP3

13:22.660 --> 13:27.320
And it'll automatically run
that file as well.

13:27.320 --> 13:31.320
It'll parse it and download the
when you run the iPodder

13:31.320 --> 13:35.840
After that, so that'll probably
about release beta 06,

13:35.840 --> 13:45.180
I hope to just have some form of
that sets it all up for you and
the program at a set interval.

13:45.180 --> 13:47.100
with one configuration file

13:48.000 --> 13:49.560
And you never hear from it

13:49.560 --> 13:52.640
It just keeps running
at the intervals that you set.

13:52.640 --> 13:56.740
And I think I mentioned in the
show

13:56.740 --> 13:58.420
that it looks like some
out there

13:58.420 --> 14:00.840
are working on their own

14:00.840 --> 14:02.940
Some Python stuff.

14:02.940 --> 14:04.260
I'm looking forward to that
out.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.100
Please, make this better than I

14:06.100 --> 14:08.680
Let's see.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.000
That's about it.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.340
Let me see.

14:10.340 --> 14:11.380
I've been at this for...

14:11.380 --> 14:11.940
How long are we going to talk?

14:11.940 --> 14:12.580
14 minutes?

14:12.580 --> 14:13.680
Okay, no song of the day.

14:13.680 --> 14:17.640
Besides, enough copyright
with that bit from the timeline

14:17.640 --> 14:22.880
But I'm going to go fill up the
with some more content.

14:22.880 --> 14:26.320
See if I can now connect the
on that

14:26.320 --> 14:30.100
so that if a new video comes in
a torrent,

14:30.100 --> 14:31.080
bit torrent file,

14:31.080 --> 14:34.920
it's downloaded and then
dropped into this watch folder

14:34.920 --> 14:37.200
on the Windows PC server

14:37.200 --> 14:38.900
so that we can then watch it in
living room.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.140
Wow.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.900
It's kind of like when I was a

14:41.900 --> 14:44.700
The RadioShack 101 projects.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.700
Just need to have a red wire, a
wire,

14:46.700 --> 14:47.620
and a nice long yellow.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.500
one and it'll all work.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.800
Okay, everybody, that's it.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.640
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

14:52.640 --> 14:52.960
Bye.

14:52.960 --> 14:53.000
Bye.
