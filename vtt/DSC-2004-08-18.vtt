WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:10.940
It's Wednesday.

00:10.940 --> 00:15.940
It's the source code and good

00:25.500 --> 00:28.580
And as you can tell I still
fixed my crappy mic problems

00:28.580 --> 00:34.940
Second or my feedback problems
just a number of technical

00:34.940 --> 00:39.800
I'm an Amsterdam right now and
on now. I have five wires

00:39.800 --> 00:43.460
Hold on headphones and
cables

00:43.460 --> 00:53.380
I'm at the Amsterdam house which
affectionately called the bunker
well, it's built like a bunker

00:53.380 --> 00:59.300
I guess in fact these houses in
we have one on the canal on the
which is the emperors canal

00:59.300 --> 01:04.540
When when they catch fire if
catch fire they never burn down

01:04.540 --> 01:11.340
They burn out is what they say
they say in other words the
always remains just the shit on
inside will

01:11.340 --> 01:13.900
leave these things are built

01:13.900 --> 01:15.540
bunkers

01:15.540 --> 01:21.180
And I had to stay in Amsterdam
of course have been away for two
been on vacation hadn't been
and we have

01:21.640 --> 01:26.940
Patricia's cosmetics company
I always want to check up on
and my assistant Chris

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
She keeps her office here. So
out with the girls.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
I just went through the latest
signing stuff, whatever.

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
And I had dinner with my banker,
is always fun.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
If you're in good standing with
bank, that is Thardy is her

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
And if you're looking to invest
money in the Benelux, let me

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Let me know, here you'll be more
happy to take care of that for

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
And all other private banking
needed.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
That was nice. It was a great

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
It was about 70 degrees.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
And it was just the city. It was

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
So nice warm summer evening.
food.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Nice wine.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Hanging out.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
Talkable friends who drop by May
may not know Rodrigo Otazu.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
He makes jewelry for great

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Jennifer Aniston's Wornam.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Beyonce. J-Lo. Madonna.

02:28.500 --> 02:35.500
and my wife. He lives in
I believe he's from Argentina
So anyway,

02:35.500 --> 02:39.380
so I'm going to stay here this
which is kind of cool because it
me an extra

02:39.380 --> 02:45.100
hour of sleep since Amsterdam is
closer to the studio than
So I don't have

02:45.100 --> 02:51.020
to get up until, oh man, 430,
believe it. Oh, and there was
really nice

02:51.020 --> 02:57.820
that I wanted to talk about.
maybe five or six weeks ago, a
of mine called

02:57.820 --> 03:03.460
an acid. You could use the
house as a set for, there was
I don't

03:03.460 --> 03:08.540
know if it was a new gadget show
a commercial or an infomercial.
not quite sure what

03:08.540 --> 03:14.940
it was. So I said, yeah, no
And so they did the shoot. I
here. Crystal

03:14.940 --> 03:19.340
was, of course, my assistant.
today she said, you know, these
they said that

03:19.340 --> 03:21.980
they're going to pick this up,
they haven't picked it up. And I
it's been long

03:21.980 --> 03:25.940
enough. You might as well just
this upstairs and go play with
And she clearly knows

03:25.940 --> 03:29.220
me quite well. It is the

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Pinnacle Systems Show Center.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.500
And I don't know if you've ever
of this.

03:35.500 --> 03:41.200
I haven't even looked at the
yet, but essentially it's a box
looks...

03:41.200 --> 03:46.480
Well, it has about the
of a DVD player, really thin new
player.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.080
Four lights on the front, that's

03:48.080 --> 03:55.080
It's just one brush metal look
one with a power switch and
a power light.

03:55.080 --> 03:57.440
A new media light, oh-ho.

03:57.440 --> 04:01.240
And something in the middle that
not have a description, so I'm
quite sure what that does.

04:01.240 --> 04:11.240
But essentially this box has a
card built in and it knows how
listen to a streaming server.

04:11.240 --> 04:15.740
And we'll display that with a
menuing system on your

04:15.740 --> 04:21.340
So this is really something that
interested in, well more for the
than technology.

04:21.340 --> 04:26.640
Because technology is probably
and we'll find out about that as
get into it probably this

04:26.640 --> 04:31.440
Just with the experience of
BitTorrent download
and

04:31.500 --> 04:34.480
And then I guess the way this
is you can set it up.

04:34.480 --> 04:40.840
So if you drop new content into
specified folder on a PC, which
course needs to be

04:40.840 --> 04:46.440
connected to your home network
well, then this box will
it and the new media

04:46.440 --> 04:49.080
light will flash and then you
get into the menuing system.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.320
You can play the new content.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.900
So this would be great for the
TV shows that I record and then
much better

04:54.900 --> 04:55.900
interface.

04:55.900 --> 05:01.820
Although I do have my doubts,
of all, I need a PC to make this
because it needs

05:01.820 --> 05:10.400
to start up a database which
your content and a streaming
to send the

05:10.400 --> 05:19.300
content from PC over the home
to the show center media player.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.580
So okay, problem one is a PC.

05:22.580 --> 05:27.620
I actually just loaded the
on my virtual PC on my Mac.

05:27.620 --> 05:30.740
It appears to work, but I really
to go to bed pretty soon, so I
be able to

05:30.740 --> 05:31.660
play with that tonight.

05:31.660 --> 05:32.660
uh...

05:33.000 --> 05:35.440
but I'll have to get a dedicated
setup for that.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.280
So that's problem one.

05:38.280 --> 05:41.720
And then of course, the
server business, you know, what
is it?

05:41.720 --> 05:42.720
Is it media streaming?

05:42.720 --> 05:45.280
Is it windows, media, windows,
streaming server?

05:45.280 --> 05:47.360
Is it a proprietary streaming

05:47.360 --> 05:50.600
That's all very unclear, but it
play.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.200
Divx, exvid, MPEG 1 and 2 and

05:54.200 --> 05:56.200
So that should work.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.280
So I'm pretty excited about

05:58.280 --> 06:00.600
I'm going to play without this
get it installed.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.800
And I will certainly report back
that.

06:04.800 --> 06:10.040
OK, let me slip the headphones
for a second because every
code

06:10.040 --> 06:14.400
needs an inspirational moment of
day, which means we're going to
some tunes.

06:14.400 --> 06:18.640
And I've got something selected
you from the voice.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.280

And before I go, I just wanted
wrap up by mentioning the
that I've been

08:57.500 --> 09:02.940
listening to, timeline by
Priton, the unabridged version,
I bought from

09:02.940 --> 09:05.220
through audible.com.

09:05.220 --> 09:06.940
Fabulous book.

09:06.940 --> 09:07.940
Absolutely amazing.

09:07.940 --> 09:09.580
I'm so enthralled in this thing.

09:09.580 --> 09:12.380
And the audiobook version is
phenomenal.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.140
Speaker is so good.

09:14.140 --> 09:15.140
I've not mentioned it before.

09:15.140 --> 09:17.140
It does the accent so well.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.420
And the story is plausible, man.

09:20.420 --> 09:24.300
I'm not into dragons and
and medieval times, et cetera.

09:24.300 --> 09:27.700
And the story does take you
through quantum travel.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.300
But wow, what an excellent book.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.900
I totally recommend it.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.380
And I was actually wondering
that.

09:33.380 --> 09:38.900
What if I decided, well, I
like this book so much, I'm
to put it on an RSS

09:38.900 --> 09:42.340
feed for distribution.

09:42.340 --> 09:43.340
And here's the question.

09:43.340 --> 09:44.980
Of course you won't be able

09:45.000 --> 09:51.960
play it since it's an AAC file
AAC or AAC whatever Apple's DRM
is. So you won't be able

09:51.960 --> 09:58.040
to play it but is there an
that if I give you that file I
you this audio file

09:58.040 --> 10:03.480
that you can then purchase it
that be great if you fired it up
iTunes and iTunes

10:03.480 --> 10:10.120
said oh I see you want to play
but it's registered to Adam
would you like to buy it

10:10.120 --> 10:14.920
and just click yes and the
is done. Now that would make a
of sense. I wonder if

10:14.920 --> 10:19.800
they've got it set up that way I
it. Food for thought at least
I'm going to end the source

10:19.800 --> 10:25.640
code today with that thought.
much blogging time today so I'll
to catch up tomorrow

10:25.640 --> 10:32.520
and look forward to it. So have
a great day, what's rest of it
a great evening or wherever

10:32.520 --> 10:39.800
you are. Kindness yeah it's so
everywhere. I'll definitely be

10:39.800 --> 10:43.240
everybody and I'll see you.
