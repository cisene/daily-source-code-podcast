WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:17.820
Hey everybody it's source code
August 19th 2004 I'm out of

00:19.500 --> 00:28.620
today from Korea Castle in
and it's a little bit later than
I guess maybe

00:28.620 --> 00:32.720
it's starting to become the norm
I was late last night as well.
10 o'clock

00:32.720 --> 00:38.280
in the evening and I'm telling
until I get to the end of these
shows, I'm

00:38.280 --> 00:42.960
not going to be able to get this
code up on a daily basis before
o'clock in the

00:42.960 --> 00:48.480
morning east coast to US time.
after that though, we'll be,

00:48.480 --> 00:55.760
be better on the timing. Okay,
switch a few things around here
my screen. A couple

00:55.760 --> 01:04.880
of things I want to talk about
First of all, you know I've been
down my

01:04.880 --> 01:10.000
year long 10 year of doing the
show for Radio Veronica here in
Netherlands.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.440
And so, you know, near the end
last week, well, next week we'll
it'll be our last

01:14.440 --> 01:19.000
week and then there's Monday and
because actually my last show is
the 31st.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
So we've got all kinds of great
book and today we have

01:21.000 --> 01:25.180
had the Leofond de Chote, famous
jockey from Tholm,

01:25.180 --> 01:27.300
30 years ago, he was on the
ships,

01:27.300 --> 01:29.980
which were operating on the
Sea.

01:29.980 --> 01:31.860
He ever heard the story behind
it's great.

01:31.860 --> 01:33.620
Now, I have to look up the

01:33.620 --> 01:35.780
of the pirate radio broadcast

01:35.780 --> 01:39.100
radio caroline, radio Veronica,
and what sea

01:39.100 --> 01:41.700
international, it was a crazy

01:41.700 --> 01:44.620
And he was one of the pirate
jockeys

01:44.620 --> 01:47.540
on one of those ships on the
waters

01:47.540 --> 01:48.780
in the North Sea.

01:48.780 --> 01:51.360
And now he is the program

01:51.360 --> 01:54.500
or the, yeah, he's the guy
responsible

01:54.500 --> 01:57.940
for the entire programming on

01:57.940 --> 02:00.180
of the top commercial television

02:00.180 --> 02:02.180
And it was really, you know, it
very intense

02:02.180 --> 02:04.220
to do a show with, so I've also
with him.

02:04.220 --> 02:07.780
He directed a live show that I
called Countdown,

02:07.780 --> 02:09.660
which was a new bass show.

02:09.660 --> 02:11.980
We had live guests and we had
performing

02:11.980 --> 02:14.980
and videos and we did that for,
know,

02:14.980 --> 02:16.500
the whole season.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.380
So we worked very intently

02:18.380 --> 02:19.980
and we've had our ups and downs.

02:19.980 --> 02:22.020
But it's always a really

02:22.500 --> 02:27.160
concentrate when you're doing it
you with someone like that,
a little bit more

02:27.160 --> 02:28.160
than normal.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.740
And I wasn't feeling too hot

02:31.740 --> 02:35.340
So I was pretty wiped out after
show.

02:35.340 --> 02:41.180
Had to go up to the flat screen
that I have a stake in called

02:41.180 --> 02:43.500
If you, you know, you should
it up, www.GrandmasterView.com.

02:43.500 --> 02:49.940
It's pretty cool that we have
flat screens at unbelievably low

02:49.940 --> 02:56.540
So in the, I got home and just
until like six or six, thirty
had dinner and

02:56.540 --> 02:58.940
now we're just kind of hanging
and about ready to go back to

02:58.940 --> 03:00.380
Such is the life of the morning.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.380
This kajake.

03:01.380 --> 03:06.860
And you can tell I'm a disc
because I have all the lore as

03:06.860 --> 03:14.860
Now about audio blogging, I
up a pretty cool post yesterday
Harold Gilchrist.

03:14.860 --> 03:20.140
And once in a second, let me see
the URL of his website is.

03:20.140 --> 03:24.020
I have to find that and put a
to it.

03:24.000 --> 03:31.120
it because radio.weblogs.com
But if you just Google it Harold
that's

03:31.120 --> 03:42.800
a G-I-L-C-H-R-I-S-T. And he
some interesting thoughts in his
audio blog about, well,

03:42.800 --> 03:49.520
what he calls the rise of audio
blogging. Of course, that
me and I

03:49.520 --> 03:55.200
can just bring my mixer back to
front here. I'm going to play a
bit, a snippet.

03:55.200 --> 04:00.080
Listen to what he's saying.
a couple of things in there that
like that he said.

04:00.080 --> 04:08.960
Check it out. This is Harold
and whereas I call this source
the daily source code,

04:08.960 --> 04:16.160
if you will. Another audio
example, which actually I took
who is Dave Weiner's

04:16.160 --> 04:21.200
morning coffee notes. And Harold
his audio blogs poolside.

04:21.200 --> 04:25.440
Anyway, but there's a lot of new
ging.

04:25.500 --> 04:31.900
big out there in a blog as fair.
usually call the blog oddspare.
that's good. That's

04:31.900 --> 04:37.700
good news. So let's back up a
I said it's the rise of the RSS
audio

04:37.700 --> 04:44.660
blogger. And again, this is just
I'll remember, but it seems that
you look

04:44.660 --> 04:51.300
at the RSS feeds of Adam and
and I believe now Doug Kay is
it for Callie,

04:51.300 --> 05:02.780
let these audio posts are
by MP3s in the feeds. And
like Adam Perry

05:02.780 --> 05:09.620
or writing scripts to take
of that being there. So follow
as good news. As

05:09.620 --> 05:17.140
an observer of audio blogging,
is very healthy. And I look
to the, did the

05:17.140 --> 05:24.740
lip in the audio blogging
get greater. And I've been
it happen now.

05:24.740 --> 05:25.740
Okay.

05:25.740 --> 05:26.740
That's

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Some nice words there from

05:29.000 --> 05:32.200
About audio blogging

05:32.200 --> 05:37.280
I don't know what Harold does. I
from his post maybe he's a
or

05:37.280 --> 05:41.840
He said it's his job to pay
to what's going on in the
so

05:41.840 --> 05:49.000
Something that one part that I
like there is that he said that
like Adam Curry. I'm like oh,

05:49.000 --> 05:52.080
Finally I'm starting to graduate
the developer sphere

05:53.160 --> 05:58.920
And I wanted to stop and talk
that for just a second because
created this thing called iPod

05:58.920 --> 06:02.080
Which more people are using than
then I anticipated

06:02.080 --> 06:08.440
Because now of course I'm
support questions and all kinds
stuff that comes along with
something

06:08.440 --> 06:17.040
My intention with iPod was to
something that unfortunately I
only do it for the Mac because
all I have and that's the only
I know how to

06:17.040 --> 06:20.120
program or develop on or

06:20.120 --> 06:22.560
integrate systems on

06:22.720 --> 06:24.880
Is

06:24.880 --> 06:28.480
That if you subscribe to an RSS
that has mp3

06:28.500 --> 06:34.220
closures like Harold explained
it will automatically show up on
iPod, really

06:34.220 --> 06:38.540
making your iPod an aggregate.

06:38.540 --> 06:43.500
And the intent behind it was
to prove the concept, show it
what I want it to

06:43.500 --> 06:49.620
be, this is how I want it to
and hopefully other people will
on to it and with a

06:49.620 --> 06:53.820
little bit of luck developers
start to make the same
hopefully better

06:53.820 --> 07:00.700
in cross-platform development

07:00.700 --> 07:08.620
Steve Garfield who is a video
well he caught me on one of the,
the Achilles

07:08.620 --> 07:11.100
heel of the iPod or application.

07:11.100 --> 07:15.660
Steve said, hey it's funny, I
all this content, didn't want
the iPod or

07:15.660 --> 07:19.220
folder and it came back

07:19.220 --> 07:23.180
So there it is, I built an
that doesn't really have a

07:23.180 --> 07:29.140
So it dollars I guess it parks
file system and uses that as a

07:30.000 --> 07:35.080
enclosures are still in the
RSS feed, it's going to want to
those in.

07:35.080 --> 07:40.200
So if you have something like,
if you have a feed that doesn't
very often,

07:40.200 --> 07:41.960
take IT conversations for

07:41.960 --> 07:47.040
There's probably 15 shows in
feed and one is added every
day or every three

07:47.040 --> 07:48.040
days.

07:48.040 --> 07:53.720
So if you remove five or six of
files, only one of them or two
them won't come

07:53.720 --> 07:54.720
back.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.760
On the contrary, this is another
I had.

07:57.760 --> 08:04.920
If you have something like
news and Dave posts an MP3 in
enclosure, if

08:04.920 --> 08:09.480
you don't, if your script isn't
often enough, Dave will out post
aggregator

08:09.480 --> 08:14.640
and that posting will actually
off the edge of the RSS file and
miss it.

08:14.640 --> 08:18.040
So all kinds of things to be
there when it comes to updating.

08:18.040 --> 08:27.160
Of course this is because we're
we're, we're not using or it's
to use

08:27.160 --> 08:31.320
uh, pings effectively because of

08:31.500 --> 08:37.500
what you want is you want to be
that something's updated and
accordingly

08:37.500 --> 08:39.940
and not necessarily pull the
time.

08:39.940 --> 08:43.460
But that's a whole other

08:43.460 --> 08:46.020
So anyway, check out

08:46.020 --> 08:48.020
He blogged the Democratic
Convention.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.020
He's really funny.

08:49.020 --> 08:53.740
I like the way he did it and I
see he's learning his video
very, very quickly.

08:53.740 --> 08:57.980
I think guess he's doing most of
on Final Cut Pro and the iMovie,
it's good stuff.

08:57.980 --> 09:02.980
And once we figure out how we
enclosures with audio, which I
is a lot easier

09:02.980 --> 09:09.700
to do, I know is a lot easier to
for just because of the sheer
of the files,

09:09.700 --> 09:16.020
I think we'll be able to apply a
of this to the video blogging.

09:16.020 --> 09:20.500
Which really, in my mind, if we
blogging in the context of audio
video blogging,

09:20.500 --> 09:23.340
it's audio and video

09:23.340 --> 09:29.800
And BitTorrent is a major part
that and I hope to start testing
that in the audio

09:29.800 --> 09:31.060
realm pretty soon.

09:31.060 --> 09:33.060
Um

09:33.000 --> 09:36.600
Okay, hope you can still stand
sound of the crappy microphone.

09:36.600 --> 09:44.280
Luckily, when I turn the mic
it doesn't crap out, and I'm
to do so with a song.

09:44.280 --> 09:52.360
And I've been thinking, I don't
have a theme for what I played
song of the day sounds, you
it's like so typical.

09:52.360 --> 09:55.720
But maybe today, I'll just be
about it.

09:55.720 --> 10:01.160
I'm really in the mood for
really hokey, you know, a 70s
song of the day,

10:01.160 --> 10:04.480
Because we're For Shout-O-Pro
for Tahoe, Jewel, or...

10:07.500 --> 10:14.500
