WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:16.500
Once again, it's the source code
we're on a Monday 23rd of August

00:16.500 --> 00:20.900
Hi everybody, it's Adam Curry
to you from Curry Castle in

00:20.900 --> 00:23.500
I am exhausted.

00:23.500 --> 00:32.940
It's been an incredibly long day
of course started with the alarm
kicking in at 3.30

00:32.940 --> 00:37.980
to go off to the radio show
went well.

00:37.980 --> 00:43.180
I had to come home pretty
because the people I told you
who come to see the

00:43.180 --> 00:49.180
house twice already, well they
to come today for the third and
time and so

00:49.180 --> 00:51.860
it looks like they're all just
set to make an offer.

00:51.860 --> 00:58.660
So hopefully stuff will move
and we can move on with our

00:58.660 --> 01:03.020
So today is going to be a little
of a short.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
version of source code because
I got home, remember this is
an hour and a half drive,

01:09.000 --> 01:14.360
and there was also an accident
the highway, so it took about
hours to get home. Then we had

01:14.360 --> 01:23.200
to go check out Christina's new
which is in Antwerp, the
school or the Antwerp

01:23.200 --> 01:30.400
International School, which will
going to at least for the next
of months. Excuse me?

01:30.400 --> 01:55.040
No. Batteries? Van lights?
how are you? It's medium open,
much car? It's real. Okay.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.500
Okay.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.500
I'm not going to do it.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.500
No, I'm not.

02:02.500 --> 02:03.500
No, I'm not.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.500
I'm not.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.500
I'm not going to do it.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.500
I'm not going to do it.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.500
I'm not going to do it.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.500
I'm not going to do it.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.500
I'm not going to do it.

02:12.000 --> 02:12.500
Sorry.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.680
This cracks me up. That was my
Patricia who just walked in. She
what I'm doing.

02:20.680 --> 02:24.840
She knows I'm recording and
she'll insist to come in and try
just mess me

02:24.840 --> 02:31.980
up, which is really part of the
I wanted to talk about today. I
the interesting

02:31.980 --> 02:41.880
blog post from Dave Slusher from
Evil Genius Chronicles at

02:41.880 --> 02:48.640
And I know that he had tried out
iPod or script and he sent me a
I think he

02:48.640 --> 02:56.000
dropped me a comment on my web
and he said that he had created
Pearl script version

02:56.000 --> 03:03.860
that does the same thing. Only
was somewhat more complete where
just throw a text

03:03.860 --> 03:08.360
file in with the URLs to the
that you subscribe to you want
subscribe to and

03:08.360 --> 03:15.080
get the MP3s from. So you can
that kind of manually. And his
runs automatically

03:15.080 --> 03:16.120
through a Cron script.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.340
because he's running it on a

03:19.340 --> 03:24.620
So his pro script is called get
enclosures.pl.

03:24.620 --> 03:30.060
And I'm writing up a whole kind
an essay about

03:30.060 --> 03:33.860
what Steve Gilmore calls the
platform.

03:33.860 --> 03:37.340
And so now that we also have the

03:37.340 --> 03:42.060
IPH Potter, which is built in a

03:42.060 --> 03:44.260
So I got to build a little
to all of that.

03:44.260 --> 03:46.980
But as I said, it took us a long

03:46.980 --> 03:49.260
to get back through traffic from
school,

03:49.260 --> 03:53.100
from our meeting with the

03:53.100 --> 03:56.260
and some of the staff and
there.

03:56.260 --> 04:01.420
So then I got back and I found
Dave Slosher's script

04:01.420 --> 04:03.380
was done, I downloaded it, it

04:03.380 --> 04:06.980
it's extremely cool and I will
about that.

04:06.980 --> 04:10.140
But maybe even more funny is

04:10.140 --> 04:15.140
he's audio blogging his evil
chronicles.

04:15.140 --> 04:17.620
And I'm gonna play a little
from that.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
where, well, you listen to it
then you'll see what I mean.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Hold on.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
Interestingly enough, my wife,
tends to be a skeptic about
kinds of things,

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
when I said something about the
blog, made the statement,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
what are you saying that's so
you need to do this audio blog?

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
Which actually, you know, is a
question to ask and a reasonable
to examine.

04:45.000 --> 04:55.000
Ultimately, I think the deal is
there's no real need that's an
access to the real question.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
The question is not what's so

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
You know, we're not audio
because it's so important.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
We're audio blogging because
another tool in the toolkit.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
It's another different, you
interesting kind of novel way of
with people.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
And one of the things that gets
in a lot of online

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
textual communication is nuance
people's voice.

05:19.500 --> 05:27.500
and you lose a lot of humor of
because you don't hear people
and you don't kind of hear the
tone of voice.

05:27.500 --> 05:34.500
And so this is just a different
way to form connections between

05:34.500 --> 05:43.500
So there's actually a gap in
that's missing where my wife
by and rolled her eyes at me as
doing this.

05:43.500 --> 05:50.500
And so you know she generally
to think that most of the stuff
kind of dumb.

05:50.500 --> 05:55.500
And I can't necessarily say that
wrong.

05:55.500 --> 06:03.500
It's important to remember that
know for as self-important as
tend to be about the

06:03.500 --> 06:10.500
99% of anyone you will ever meet
that you're full of shit.

06:10.500 --> 06:18.500
So that's an important kind of
thing that we need to keep that
think we're bringing about the

06:18.500 --> 06:20.500
and everyone else thinks we're a

06:21.000 --> 06:25.200
So, you know, gotta keep the

06:25.200 --> 06:28.080
I actually made notes for this
because I wanted to do it.

06:28.080 --> 06:33.440
Okay, so it was interesting that
actually pulled that excerpt
his blog post from

06:33.440 --> 06:38.040
yesterday from the 22nd, because
has exactly the same thing at
whereas wife walks

06:38.040 --> 06:41.120
in, rolls her eyes, like, you
you're fucking crazy.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.080
What are you doing talking to

06:43.080 --> 06:47.160
Who are you talking to and how
you going to make money on this?

06:47.160 --> 06:49.640
Is this what you're going to do
the rest of your life?

06:49.640 --> 06:54.760
Well, clearly, if we both had
same situation, we found each
so quickly in the game,

06:54.760 --> 07:01.360
there's gotta be more of us and
stuff to be done, I presume.

07:01.360 --> 07:06.600
So right, oh yes, I wanted to
you a song of the day.

07:06.600 --> 07:15.440
This is from Dutch band, jazz
a whole bunch of different

07:15.440 --> 07:17.040
They did play at the Nord Sea
Festival.

07:17.040 --> 07:22.400
I think it was not this year,
this past show, but the year
that.

07:22.500 --> 07:27.500
And this is from... I think the
album released.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.500
And I've linked to it before on
blog.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.500
This one's called How the Wind

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
Check it out.

07:34.500 --> 07:40.500
And we're coming blue in the

07:40.500 --> 07:45.500
I see a little girl.

07:45.500 --> 07:49.500
She won the stool world.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.500
But something's wrong with her.

07:53.500 --> 07:57.500
She walks barefoot with a turd.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.500
A young child without a home.

08:01.500 --> 08:05.500
Sniffs go to carry on.

08:05.500 --> 08:08.500
Why should we cry for him?

08:08.500 --> 08:11.500
We just... a j-woke.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.500
And I talk about the wind move.

08:14.500 --> 08:18.500
I don't know if this is bad or

08:18.500 --> 08:20.500
This is so sad.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.500
How the wind blows.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.500
I don't know.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.240
This is Batchoo, this is so sad

08:28.240 --> 08:36.400
There is this little boy, he's
a living time

08:36.400 --> 08:40.200
No mane on holiday

08:40.200 --> 08:43.400
Pays my, it's okay

08:43.400 --> 08:47.200
How the wind blows, and I don't

08:47.200 --> 08:51.000
This is Batchoo, this is so sad

08:51.000 --> 08:54.800
How the wind blows, and I don't

08:54.800 --> 08:58.400
This is Batchoo, this is so sad

08:58.400 --> 09:01.000
And I don't know

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
This is Batchoo, this is so sad

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
And I don't know

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
This is Batchoo, this is so sad

09:10.500 --> 09:28.500
Start moving and keep me
I am a few Ten thousand bodies,
by the enemy.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.500
So cold but...

09:31.500 --> 09:35.500
I am a few Ten thousand bodies,
by the enemy.

09:35.500 --> 10:01.500
I am a few Ten thousand bodies,
by the enemy.

10:03.000 --> 10:21.000
How the wind blows, I don't know
is bad, you know this is so sad,
know how the wind blows, I don't
this is sad, you know this is so
you know

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
So sad to know

10:33.000 --> 10:49.900
Look in the industry...

10:49.900 --> 10:54.860
chat Mia

10:54.860 --> 11:04.560
It's a sad thing, but you're

11:04.500 --> 11:10.940
mode Jones how the wind blows

11:10.940 --> 11:13.740
yeah man never bother

11:13.740 --> 11:23.340
that their entire album by the
was recorded all on a Macintosh
Pro Tools did at

11:23.340 --> 11:29.380
their house in their attic these
really are starving musicians
them on the radio

11:29.380 --> 11:34.060
show a couple times and they're
and power to them I think they
some really

11:34.060 --> 11:41.300
great tunes oh by the way hope
noticed that my audio is no
crackling the quality

11:41.300 --> 11:48.380
should be a little bit higher
using a combination of two
that basically give me what

11:48.380 --> 11:54.300
I want one of them is a wiretap
allows me to record the audio
any application

11:54.300 --> 12:02.220
there are a couple of different
that do that like audio hijack
there's a program

12:02.220 --> 12:05.980
that I found. It's not perfect,
it points out to me

12:06.000 --> 12:11.680
through a comment on my blog
about better software for audio
It's called Live

12:11.680 --> 12:17.800
L-I-V-E is for the Macintosh and
does give me the ability to
my microphone

12:17.800 --> 12:26.200
and makes tracks. I can even
assign keys to different clips
play. Yeah, I

12:26.200 --> 12:31.400
mean, there's a few, it's
an overly complicated interface
someone who's just

12:31.400 --> 12:35.780
doing simple blogging stuff. But
you could switch between a real
version of this

12:35.780 --> 12:41.220
interface with what's running
and then this more vast expanded
that would

12:41.220 --> 12:46.700
be perfect. Now, of course, the
to this is it only works with
files and

12:46.700 --> 12:52.400
not with MP3s. So first you have
convert any MP3s who want to
to AIFF and then

12:52.400 --> 12:55.960
you have to import them. So it
to be a little bit of an ordeal,
we're getting

12:55.960 --> 13:02.840
closer. And with that, I'd say
going to wrap up this version of
daily source

13:02.840 --> 13:06.840
code. Again, there's an essay
about the iPod or

13:07.500 --> 13:14.100
Or the iPod platform and the
versions of iPod are there now
there and

13:14.100 --> 13:21.240
You know hopefully how we're
close to creating something so I
talk to you tomorrow as we

13:21.240 --> 13:26.020
But what is tomorrow is tomorrow
Wednesday hump day? I'll see you

13:26.020 --> 13:53.960
The power of the sword is not.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.960
I
