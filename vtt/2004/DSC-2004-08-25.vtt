00:01.500 --> 00:15.500
Once again it's time for the
code. It is Wednesday, on the
of August 25th,

00:15.500 --> 00:21.620
2004. Good afternoon, good
good morning wherever you are.
Adam Curry. Welcome to

00:21.620 --> 00:29.340
my daily brain dump which
showed up on your iPod or the
device automatically

00:29.340 --> 00:37.340
this morning. It's Wednesday
here and Wednesday still is a
day. It's the

00:37.340 --> 00:42.620
middle of the week and again the
clock went off at 3.30 this
and I'm feeling

00:42.620 --> 00:48.380
pretty worn down but we're
closer to the end of that. I
to talk about a

00:48.380 --> 00:55.860
couple things today mainly about
these audio blog posts or audio
should be.

00:55.860 --> 01:02.740
This morning though when I got
Dave slushers getting closures.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.720
Pearl script had nicely
a brand new IT conversations on
iPod

01:07.720 --> 01:15.080
And I was extremely happy to see
it was an hour and two minutes
my commute is about an hour and
minutes

01:15.080 --> 01:18.920
And it was IT conversations very
Oprah Hallie suit

01:18.920 --> 01:23.840
With the second installment of
trip down memory lane the show
called memory lane

01:23.840 --> 01:31.480
The first one was with Joey Ito
this time she interviewed Dan
who is the

01:32.360 --> 01:37.800
The founding father of the
Busy Cal for those of you who

01:37.800 --> 01:45.640
And it was again a great great
you know, you just listen to you
to lots of computer

01:45.640 --> 01:48.840
science and technology history

01:48.840 --> 01:53.000
Events that took place that I
I remember a lot of them

01:53.000 --> 01:58.760
Which is nice. It's it's funny
hear how they do that, you know,
think she

01:59.480 --> 02:02.920
Because of her very personal
I think she gets a lot more out

02:04.500 --> 02:08.660
people like Dan, then someone
might.

02:08.660 --> 02:09.500
I don't know.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.980
I've done that again.

02:11.980 --> 02:14.380
But it's certainly worth
good show.

02:14.380 --> 02:16.780
And then I did say that it was
hour and two minutes.

02:16.780 --> 02:17.980
I was really happy about that.

02:17.980 --> 02:19.500
And that immediately got me to
about,

02:19.500 --> 02:24.620
well, what is the ideal length
one of these shows?

02:24.620 --> 02:26.820
Of course, depending on how
are going to use it,

02:26.820 --> 02:29.420
I presume that some will

02:29.420 --> 02:32.500
find being three or four or five
long.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.620
But I'm just supposing here that
lot of people

02:35.620 --> 02:38.860
listen to these during a commute
in the morning

02:38.860 --> 02:40.620
or in the afternoon and sitting
your car,

02:40.620 --> 02:43.900
you're on the train, the bus,
whatever.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.620
So I think that they should
be, well,

02:46.620 --> 02:51.940
if it's a set show, maybe with a
for every episode,

02:51.940 --> 02:53.780
it could easily be half an hour
an hour,

02:53.780 --> 02:55.740
so you could split it up.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.100
I'm trying to keep mine to 15

02:58.100 --> 02:59.900
because, well, I figured if I'm
myself,

02:59.900 --> 03:02.820
I must be boring the tears out
you,

03:02.820 --> 03:04.460
which is also an interesting

03:04.460 --> 03:07.460
As Andy Warhol once said, 15

03:06.000 --> 03:12.300
15 minutes of fame. Maybe these
are supposed to be about 15
One that

03:12.300 --> 03:19.600
is much shorter but showed up a
spoof of me, courtesy of Steve
Now Steve

03:19.600 --> 03:25.200
has done some video blogging
most recently from the
National

03:25.200 --> 03:32.320
Convention. He's really getting
chops down on editing, putting
own stuff together.

03:32.320 --> 03:36.400
He found some video blog
I linked to it on my web blog.
should check it

03:36.400 --> 03:41.160
out because I'm quite impressed
the software. You register, you
in. It says,

03:41.160 --> 03:46.100
can we connect to your webcam?
it did not mine. I'm on a Mac,
I presume that

03:46.100 --> 03:52.520
may have something to do with
But no configuration. You just
record and then you can record

03:52.520 --> 03:56.960
your video. It stores it on
server. Really nice.

03:56.960 --> 04:03.440
And so Steve, I guess he's a
because he did a spoof on the
Source code and

04:03.440 --> 04:07.480
he did a video version of it, a
message. So I'll play the audio
the

04:07.500 --> 04:08.500
that for you.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.500
Okay.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.780
Hello and welcome to the Daily
Code.

04:11.780 --> 04:15.740
Hi, I'm Eddie Adam Curry Castle
in Belgium because some people
you know, we're

04:15.740 --> 04:17.740
only $50,000 close to someone.

04:17.740 --> 04:19.580
So I hope that really goes

04:19.580 --> 04:20.820
Hang on a second.

04:20.820 --> 04:21.820
We got dogs here and everything.

04:21.820 --> 04:22.820
You know, it's crazy.

04:22.820 --> 04:23.820
There's lots of animals here.

04:23.820 --> 04:24.820
There's the phone.

04:24.820 --> 04:25.820
And my wife's coming in.

04:25.820 --> 04:26.820
She wants to talk to me.

04:26.820 --> 04:27.820
Some believable show.

04:27.820 --> 04:28.820
She always wants to talk to me.

04:28.820 --> 04:29.820
She knows I'm trying to do this.

04:29.820 --> 04:30.820
I'm not making any money.

04:30.820 --> 04:31.820
That's why she's mad.

04:31.820 --> 04:32.820
Okay.

04:32.820 --> 04:33.820
So that's the Daily Source Code
today.

04:33.820 --> 04:34.660
We'll see you again tomorrow.

04:34.660 --> 04:37.900
As far as I could tell, I did
without a script.

04:37.900 --> 04:40.220
I thought that was pretty good.

04:40.220 --> 04:41.740
And it's true though, you know,
is...

04:41.740 --> 04:43.660
Hello and welcome to the Daily
Code.

04:43.660 --> 04:46.460
Hi, I'm Eddie Adam Curry,
here in Belgium.

04:46.460 --> 04:49.660
We don't want that to be looping

04:49.660 --> 04:51.460
Okay.

04:51.460 --> 04:55.620
He's right that there's, you
I feel like I'm pretty crazy,
know, doing this

04:55.620 --> 04:59.300
stuff, trying to figure it out,
to get people to transfer stuff

04:59.300 --> 05:00.300
onto their iPod.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.100
But I know there's got to be
there of if now I'm already
spooked by Steve

05:04.100 --> 05:10.300
Garfield then you know you're
the big time but I do think that

05:09.000 --> 05:16.080
Writing is one thing on web
when it comes to being able to
through

05:16.080 --> 05:18.040
audio and video.

05:18.040 --> 05:22.120
Doing this stuff takes practice.

05:22.120 --> 05:25.080
They call it the recording arts
sciences.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.360
There's stuff to be learned to
it.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.360
There's software that isn't
very user friendly.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.920
There's a pretty steep learning
in the beginning.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.440
I think that there will be a
though.

05:36.440 --> 05:37.440
Maybe it's audiobooks.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.400
Maybe it's audio blogs.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.000
As I'm sure there will be a
market.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.960
Once we start to make it a
bit easier to receive stuff, to
it onto your player,

05:47.960 --> 05:50.320
your play or whatever your play
device is.

05:50.320 --> 05:55.360
I think that the download
is a lot more interesting
we can get a lot

05:55.360 --> 05:56.360
higher quality.

05:56.360 --> 05:59.160
You don't have to sit around
for stuff.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.640
It just kind of shows up.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.720
Yeah, it's not a video on

06:02.720 --> 06:03.720
It's not immediate.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.560
It's a video by subscription or
by subscription.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.520
That's why I was talking about
which I like.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.100
I know I've mentioned it before.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.620
I listened to a lot of them,
because I've been in the car a
in the

06:15.620 --> 06:17.420
past year.

06:17.420 --> 06:20.020
And Dave Weiner, I tried to talk
him today.

06:20.020 --> 06:22.820
He's traveling on his way to

06:22.820 --> 06:25.220
He's going to be on the road for
week and he's blogging from the

06:25.220 --> 06:27.740
You can see it on scripting.com.

06:27.740 --> 06:33.300
And he had sent me a note that
had listened to my source code
he said, well, thanks

06:33.300 --> 06:34.300
for the recommendation.

06:34.300 --> 06:37.900
I subscribed, signed up with

06:37.900 --> 06:43.980
And I also downloaded the book
you would suggest, which is
by Michael Criton,

06:43.980 --> 06:46.660
which is 14 hours worth of MP3

06:46.660 --> 06:48.700
But I thought it was very

06:48.700 --> 06:52.700
Dave hated it and he's been in
car and he's been playing this

06:52.700 --> 06:53.700
He said it was almost done.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.740
He's listened more than 13 hours
the book that he hates.

06:55.740 --> 07:00.860
So, it may not be the best guy
refer audio books to you.

07:00.860 --> 07:03.860
But then I thought for a second,
know...

07:03.860 --> 07:07.820
Cute, no one's reviewing audio

07:07.820 --> 07:08.820
Maybe there's something there.

07:08.820 --> 07:12.020
Oprah certainly did okay with
book club.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.280
And since I've already listened
so many of them, what the heck
try and review

07:17.280 --> 07:19.320
now and then.

07:19.320 --> 07:27.380
So for instance today, what we
I've been listening to a book
Anti-Americanism

07:27.380 --> 07:32.000
by French author Jean-Francois
Vérez.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.600
They did that accent, huh?

07:33.600 --> 07:35.280
Of course it's been translated.

07:35.280 --> 07:41.320
Apparently he wrote another book
Without Marks or Jesus, which
was

07:41.320 --> 07:42.320
a bestseller.

07:42.320 --> 07:49.120
Unfortunately, I don't know
about it nor is it available on

07:49.120 --> 07:55.320
Just go to the blurb here, what
give you about the book

07:55.320 --> 07:59.640
Just taking a moment here.

07:59.640 --> 08:03.280
Of course, lots of heavy
going on in the community.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.200
There we go.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.500
Of course, now it's out here it

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
Hold on.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.500
So there's two...

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
We're sorry.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.500
We've encountered an assistant
on your browser.

08:16.500 --> 08:20.500
It was less idle and lost
with audible.com.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.500
Oh, thanks.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.500
So, I guess I can't plug in your
writing there.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.500
Okay.

08:25.500 --> 08:30.500
So this book was also quite
because it discusses

08:30.500 --> 08:32.500
It's written by a French guy.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.500
And he basically says, bullshit.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.500
You know, all of this stuff
all these...

08:37.500 --> 08:40.500
There are so many myths about
that someone has to say it.

08:40.500 --> 08:44.500
And by the way, we as Europeans
want to look at ourselves once
a while

08:44.500 --> 08:52.500
before we start pointing the
overseas at the hyper superpower
the United States of America.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.500
A couple things about

08:55.500 --> 08:59.500
So, you know, one, there's just
story and the book and whatever
going to listen to.

08:59.500 --> 09:05.500
Then, of course, there's the
how the reader, you know,
the words.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.500
And there's also the quality.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.000
the quality.

09:09.000 --> 09:16.300
And in this is a prime example
I think, a reader that just
put everything into it that he

09:16.300 --> 09:19.480
or he sounds a little bit too
it's very dry.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.600
I think he reads just a tad too

09:21.600 --> 09:25.600
And the quality really, really
ass.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.800
But I want you to listen to a
bit of it.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.800
So you get a feel for this book.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.100
His title is a little bit
by a French guy.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.100
Well, it's actually none of

09:35.100 --> 09:37.500
So listen to this from John F.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.580
you

09:42.000 --> 09:47.320
We deceive ourselves if we think
can negotiate with the al-Qaeda
and their ilk.

09:47.320 --> 09:52.000
For this course to have the
chance of success, their
would have to

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
be logical.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.480
As it is, an abyss separates
from any rational course of
and terrorism is

09:59.480 --> 10:01.800
the parody of policy that serves
fill it.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.880
you

10:04.500 --> 10:09.780
The days that immediately
the unleashing of the full
war against

10:09.780 --> 10:14.820
democracy in general and the
States in particular turned out
be an extremely

10:14.820 --> 10:17.260
interesting and revealing
ground.

10:17.260 --> 10:22.620
Since over a period of two
the phobias and fallacies of
anti-Americanism

10:22.620 --> 10:27.340
and of neo-totalitarianism
intensified.

10:27.340 --> 10:32.900
The clumsiest of these fallacies
an attempt to justify Islamist
by claiming

10:32.900 --> 10:36.340
that America has long been
towards Islam.

10:36.340 --> 10:41.060
But the truth is that the United
actions historically have been
less damaging to

10:41.060 --> 10:44.980
Muslim interests than the
of Britain, France or Russia.

10:44.980 --> 10:49.980
These European powers have
Muslim countries, occupied and
oppressed

10:49.980 --> 10:53.420
them over decades and even

10:53.420 --> 10:57.380
Americans on the other hand have
colonized a Muslim nation.

10:57.380 --> 11:01.140
Americans' events know hostility
Islam as such today.

11:01.140 --> 11:06.020
the contrary their interventions
Somalia, Bosnia and Kosovo as
as the pressure

11:06.000 --> 11:11.280
exerted on the Macedonian
were designed to defend most of

11:11.280 --> 11:16.720
I've been listening to this book
the past couple of days. I think
about

11:16.720 --> 11:24.800
six hours worth of five and a
hours worth of audio. It's
hard to concentrate.

11:24.800 --> 11:32.400
You heard the speaker. It's just
a nice voice at all and sounds
nasal. I should

11:32.400 --> 11:39.600
take that back to Audible and
them they should get it redone.
do pick up a lot of things.

11:39.600 --> 11:48.160
It's all of the books. I'll try
do one a day as long as the
lasts. For all the books

11:48.160 --> 11:55.440
that are about the Bush Bin
connection and 9-11
I listened to a lot of those.

11:55.440 --> 11:59.840
This one definitely gives you a
different perspective. Even some

11:59.840 --> 12:06.640
myths or some common beliefs
I've never really stopped to
about really are quite mythical.

12:07.500 --> 12:15.540
If you do, if different facts or
angles perspective is shown to
which this book does.

12:15.540 --> 12:22.300
One more thing I had for us

12:24.000 --> 12:37.000
was second this was a some note
I'd made myself taxes once you
the audio software running that
just anything any other
you bring to the foreground
to hurt.

12:37.000 --> 12:50.500
I want to talk about the in a
were the are bought g are that
spreading the internet at least
getting a lot of a lot of
a lot of stories about this.

12:50.500 --> 13:05.500
So this were was distributed
to the back door and essentially
the distributor of the were to
your webcam and look at you and
in on you or whatever the webcam
pointed at.

13:05.500 --> 13:11.500
And it's like everyone's acting
this is a bad thing I think this
great this should be a feature
built into every single

13:11.500 --> 13:19.500
In fact would it be nice if we
did have a compatible video
system this guy apparently has
all figured out whoever has done
were because.

13:19.500 --> 13:25.500
He can check on all our webcam
you know I think this needs to
explored from a whole different
and.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.460
And quite frankly, I wouldn't
looking at someone else's

13:29.460 --> 13:33.060
