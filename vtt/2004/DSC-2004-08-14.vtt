00:01.500 --> 00:20.460
Hi everybody and welcome to
source code. That's Jesse, my
saying hi as well.

00:20.460 --> 00:25.500
On a second. Well, I got to
off with a gripe right off the
I've spent hours

00:25.500 --> 00:30.500
today trying to find software
will do what I wanted to do to
these shows.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.500
I'm sorry, go ahead.

00:33.500 --> 00:38.500
And it wasn't easy searching the
today because we had not one but
different families

00:38.500 --> 00:42.500
come to check out the house, see
they want to buy it.

00:42.500 --> 00:47.500
Which, you know, it's kind of
Anyway, so I mean, I've been
around and there's

00:47.500 --> 00:54.500
plenty of software if you want
stream stuff live to a
server or live 365.

00:54.500 --> 01:02.500
But nothing, excuse me, that
includes the ability to mix more
one of those

01:03.000 --> 01:09.640
to MP3s together and to also
a microphone channel, at least
for Macintosh. So if

01:09.640 --> 01:17.120
anyone has any ideas, love to
about them. Let's see. Well,
because one of the main

01:17.120 --> 01:23.800
reasons actually that want to
that type of a setup is, you
for stuff like a

01:23.800 --> 01:29.000
song of the day. I've done some
with keep holding the mic up to
speaker,

01:29.000 --> 01:36.160
but it sucks. Yeah, if I'm going
put songs on, then might as well
good, or at least

01:36.160 --> 01:45.720
halfway decent. One to just stop
and think for a second about
Child, who

01:45.720 --> 01:52.120
passed away yesterday, age 91,
I, it's a nice age actually, I
if, you know,

01:52.120 --> 01:56.320
but she's one of these people
been around for just, you know,
for generations.

01:56.320 --> 02:02.720
I remember as a kid living in
Maryland, Julia Child came to
at the local,

02:02.720 --> 02:04.160
I think it was the high school.

02:04.500 --> 02:11.500
and you can hire pleasant view
or something like that.

02:11.500 --> 02:17.340
And, yes, she cooked up a big,
batch of spaghetti and meatballs
families.

02:17.340 --> 02:21.380
I could, you know, for a couple
ahead go eat there.

02:21.380 --> 02:25.340
And I remember distinctly the
was really good, although a bit
by the time

02:25.340 --> 02:26.340
we got ours.

02:26.340 --> 02:32.700
I remember my parents were like
little bit tense.

02:32.700 --> 02:39.060
They were a little bit tense
the service, which of course was
by high school kids.

02:39.060 --> 02:42.380
So people who came in after us
served before us.

02:42.380 --> 02:43.820
Anyway, but it was good.

02:43.820 --> 02:44.820
I do remember that.

02:44.820 --> 02:51.180
And I actually found a Julia
quote and she had a lot of
good ones through

02:51.180 --> 02:53.660
the blog digger enclosure feed.

02:53.660 --> 02:55.140
Check this out.

02:55.140 --> 02:57.820
Now, hold on a second.

02:57.820 --> 03:02.060
See, this is why I need good
to do this for me.

03:02.060 --> 03:05.620
Okay, here's that quote again.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.640
Just boil it in a big pot of

03:09.640 --> 03:15.120
Just boil it in a big pot of

03:15.120 --> 03:21.760
See other things I sometimes
my eye was a Paris Hilton

03:21.760 --> 03:26.200
Her dogs gone missing her her
a pet chihuahua

03:26.200 --> 03:31.760
I gotta say I really like the
Hilton reality show the one she
with Nicole Ritchie

03:32.680 --> 03:39.200
Even though it's not officially
broadcast in Europe yet. I don't
maybe it's gonna start in

03:39.200 --> 03:45.400
I've I've seen the entire first
and I'm up to almost up to speed
the second season

03:45.400 --> 03:48.720
because of the bit torrent feeds
able to

03:48.720 --> 03:54.400
Download an episode well maybe
or three days after it's been

03:54.400 --> 03:57.120
and I'm using

03:57.120 --> 04:00.560
This great program called
I've linked to it before

04:01.360 --> 04:05.400
it's basically it's a little
application script and

04:05.400 --> 04:08.040
I have it sitting on the

04:07.500 --> 04:13.860
server at my data center and it
keywords and it can only it's
pretty

04:13.860 --> 04:21.220
rudimentary but so it can only
one RSS feed and it looks for
which

04:21.220 --> 04:25.620
are just basic search terms so
got in their simple life growing
Gody

04:25.620 --> 04:35.860
which is a new show that I just
just started watching. Hi

04:40.500 --> 04:43.500
That's my daughter Christina.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.680
He's going to use the other
so I'll just walk outside to
for a second to

04:50.680 --> 04:51.680
you guys.

04:51.680 --> 04:52.680
So back to the keywords.

04:52.680 --> 04:58.160
It's really great because it
sits there, it parses through
big RSS file that comes

04:58.160 --> 04:59.960
in and it's updated very

04:59.960 --> 05:01.320
The TV torrents.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.360
And when it catches one of those
it downloads it.

05:04.360 --> 05:10.000
So of course I'm also getting
serendipitous content.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.600
Not everything that has the
simple and life in the title is
Hilton's reality

05:14.600 --> 05:16.760
show.

05:16.760 --> 05:21.840
And then once it's in there, I
notified and then at my
I just download,

05:21.840 --> 05:27.040
batch download, all the new
which is a pretty fast link.

05:27.040 --> 05:31.280
And that way it saves me a lot
hassle and the aggregation is 24

05:31.280 --> 05:34.280
So basically it's the last yard.

05:34.280 --> 05:39.560
It's on my server just not at
house yet.

05:39.560 --> 05:46.400
And what I really like about
is that it doesn't leave your
files open.

05:46.500 --> 05:52.800
So it just sucks it in and of
while it's downloading a file
it doesn't one

05:52.800 --> 05:57.300
at a time which also helps on
the pipes.

05:57.300 --> 06:01.300
It is uploading but once it's
it's done and then it goes on to
next torrent.

06:01.300 --> 06:07.380
Because last night I downloaded
torrent here which is a 250 meg
file and this morning

06:07.380 --> 06:14.500
when I woke up I had pushed out
750 megs and like you know that
more than I thought

06:14.500 --> 06:21.060
I had to offer it and not that I
mind about the cost or anything
I literally

06:21.060 --> 06:25.200
can't buy more upstream than
from my ISP here in Belgium.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.720
Well, I'm just gonna take a look
my notes for a second.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.640
Right.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.680
So that's one final thing.

06:43.680 --> 06:48.960
Last night, watched the
the opening ceremony,

06:48.960 --> 06:51.400
which was prime time here in

06:51.400 --> 06:55.720
And I thought that the Greek did
pretty good job.

06:55.720 --> 06:58.320
Their opening show wasn't as
for TV

06:58.320 --> 07:01.160
as it was, for instance, in Los
or Sydney.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.560
But the show definitely was

07:02.560 --> 07:04.400
And water is always hard to do
television

07:04.400 --> 07:08.640
to make it look really

07:08.640 --> 07:12.000
What I thought was, well, first
all, there was DJ Chiesto,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.280
who was our pride and joy in the

07:15.280 --> 07:18.920
He was spinning all the dance

07:18.920 --> 07:21.040
during the presentation of all
the athletes

07:21.040 --> 07:23.400
from all the countries as they
around the track

07:23.400 --> 07:25.840
and then collected into the

07:25.840 --> 07:28.720
That was so very cool seeing

07:28.720 --> 07:30.640
He's been voted top DJ of the

07:30.640 --> 07:34.960
for the, I think, the past three
consecutively.

07:34.960 --> 07:39.680
What caught my eye is that the
of video cameras

07:40.500 --> 07:45.780
cameras and digital still
but the athletes who were being
the crowd

07:45.780 --> 07:50.980
carried with them was like wow
I'd love to see some of that
or some of those

07:50.980 --> 07:56.580
pictures and you know we have
the bits we could connect them
together. I'm presuming

07:56.580 --> 08:01.060
that they have some kind of
access in the in what is it in
Olympic Village

08:01.060 --> 08:06.060
but maybe they even have Wi-Fi I
know but it should be just as
as plugging

08:06.060 --> 08:14.940
your camera into your laptop and
saying broadcast this. And I
there's

08:14.940 --> 08:19.860
two sides to that equation and
trying to fix the first side
working on it in

08:19.860 --> 08:30.060
audio to make the iPod more than
something that you sync to
I want your iPod

08:30.060 --> 08:38.540
to be a receiver in a way where
put it in its cradle to charge
it loads it up

08:38.540 --> 08:40.580
with new audio from the web.

08:40.580 --> 08:41.580
and that's it.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.840
And it should be seamless.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.640
You don't have to think about it
it should let you know.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.240
And it should, you know, that
done that and it put it

08:48.240 --> 08:51.920
into a perfect playlist.

08:51.920 --> 08:55.880
And I've been hacking around
that, which is pretty easy,

08:55.880 --> 09:00.400
well, relatively easy on the Mac
it's already

09:00.400 --> 09:03.760
kind of meant to work together.

09:03.760 --> 09:10.000
So I'm going to continue working
that and release the script

09:10.000 --> 09:12.760
or code or whatever you want to
it and who knows,

09:12.760 --> 09:15.920
maybe folks will make it work
Windows.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.840
And then, of course, is the
side to the equation,

09:17.840 --> 09:22.200
which is how do you make it
for people to broadcast that?

09:22.200 --> 09:25.560
Is it as simple as maybe
an on the go playlist

09:25.560 --> 09:26.400
on your iPod?

09:26.400 --> 09:29.120
And when you put it back into
charging stand,

09:29.120 --> 09:33.960
it looks at that playlist and
it into an RSS 2.0 feed

09:33.960 --> 09:35.400
with enclosures.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.440
And maybe the enclosures are
files.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.080
I don't know.

09:39.080 --> 09:43.480
Well, I guess I don't have to
because this is source code,
This is just stuff running
my brain

09:43.500 --> 09:49.020
I was a little more
than I wanted.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.760
Ahh...

09:55.500 --> 09:56.500
No, that's about it.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.500
I'm gonna walk out one more

10:01.500 --> 10:03.500
It's weird.

10:04.500 --> 10:12.140
Can't sit in the in the bar with
my daughter and talk to you like
cuz she'd probably burst out

10:12.140 --> 10:15.360
If you heard me talking to
so that's it

10:15.360 --> 10:18.660
For today's edition

10:18.660 --> 10:20.660
If you do have any ideas about
software

10:20.660 --> 10:23.860
That that I need you know that
a mic channel

10:23.860 --> 10:27.540
Please drop me line Adam at
calm

10:27.540 --> 10:32.420
Or you know leave a comment
on my web log live

10:32.980 --> 10:36.540
Curie calm l i v e dot curry

10:36.540 --> 10:44.860
Well, I guess it should have
the beginning. This was source
for Saturday August 14th 2004

10:44.860 --> 10:49.460
We'll talk to you again tomorrow

10:49.460 --> 10:51.460
Bye
