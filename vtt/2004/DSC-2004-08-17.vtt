00:51.420 --> 00:54.860
it's somehow the software is not

I'll only know after I listen
to the recording.

Ito. In this particular
there was a piece

05:11.500 --> 05:15.500
where he tells a story that he
me when I met him at Blodecon
for the 10 minutes

05:15.500 --> 05:19.500
we spoke, he told me this story.
there's a little more to it than
mentions in the

05:19.500 --> 05:23.860
interview, but I just want you
listen to it. So once again from
Conversations, I've

05:23.860 --> 05:30.060
linked to it on my blog. It's at
It's Joe Ito being interviewed
Halley

05:30.060 --> 05:37.060
Su. The internet was eventually
to completely change the way
the media business worked.

05:37.060 --> 05:44.060
Right. And that's when I shifted
away. So in the early 90s I
a little bit from

05:44.060 --> 05:48.180
just traditional media and music
computer graphics and virtual
And I was working

05:48.180 --> 05:53.700
with my brother-in-law Scott
then. But when I saw this Mac
and I saw packets

05:53.700 --> 05:58.820
which networks are actually
working on a Macintosh, I
that this is a client

05:58.820 --> 06:04.620
to really shift and that I would
a lot more freedom in the
because I had

06:04.620 --> 06:06.020
felt so much better.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.720
What do you call it?

06:08.720 --> 06:10.760
Lack of freedom in physical

06:10.760 --> 06:11.760
They're constrained.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.120
And I started preaching this
thing sort of in the early 90s.

06:15.120 --> 06:20.160
I was showing the Chairman of
the Adam Curry's page where he
these videos and

06:20.160 --> 06:21.160
stuff like that.

06:21.160 --> 06:26.560
And this is sort of back when
I think it was when we were
Go for an FTP and.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.560
Okay.

06:27.560 --> 06:35.400
So the video Joey is referring
is actually me in the circus of
stars on ABC television,

06:35.400 --> 06:40.980
during the death defying rocket
of death, where I was up like 60
in the air in

06:40.980 --> 06:42.520
a roller coaster car.

06:42.520 --> 06:48.880
I roll down the track ends at
bottom, which launches me
an angry wall of fire.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.440
And then I finally land on a
of mattresses and there's Hulk
to welcome.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.120
It was very bizarre.

06:54.120 --> 07:02.440
And it was a clip that we cut to
Man by Elton John for I think
was something

07:02.440 --> 07:03.720
we broadcast on MTV.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.820
I made a quick time out of it.

07:05.820 --> 07:07.540
And I've got to tell you, I've
the tape.

07:07.500 --> 07:12.700

video. I told Chris

07:12.700 --> 07:20.940
and I told you it's impossible.
on. I told Joe you do this and
promised that he would send me

07:20.940 --> 07:26.380
that he would send me a link or
that I could get a hold of that
of that quick time

07:26.380 --> 07:28.380
that original quick time because
says he still has it.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.600
So, Joey, if you are listening,
you heard this, still waiting
the video, but quick

07:36.600 --> 07:38.760
iPod or update.

07:38.760 --> 07:45.260
So I've released beta 03, which
you don't have to do anything,
configuration.

07:45.260 --> 07:51.040
It has four feeds currently in
including IT conversations as

07:51.040 --> 07:52.720
You can edit that script if you

07:52.720 --> 07:57.700
Just by opening it up in the
editor, which you find in your
skip folder,

07:57.700 --> 08:06.080
in your applications folder on
OS X, you can add URLs to that.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.520
But you don't have to do
else just to fire it up and
run and create an

08:09.520 --> 08:11.680
iPod or folder on your desktop.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.080
That's why all your content is
in.

08:13.080 --> 08:21.280
It creates a playlist for each
channel in iTunes and puts all
new shows or content

08:21.280 --> 08:23.080
or whatever it is in there.

08:23.080 --> 08:27.280
And then if you stick your iPod
your dock, press though, it's
updated

08:27.280 --> 08:29.280
with everything new for you in
morning.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.280
Beautiful thing.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.500
In fact, it makes me wanna sing.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.500
To sing a lot.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.500
It's good hokey.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.500
Play something, uh...

08:39.500 --> 08:40.500
You know, kind of a habit.

08:40.500 --> 08:45.500
I don't know, uh, this is from,
I think it's 1963.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.500

08:46.500 --> 08:50.500
