00:01.500 --> 00:17.500
Hi everybody, it is the source
for Friday, August 27th, 2004.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.500
Good afternoon or good morning
good evening, wherever you are,
you're listening

00:20.500 --> 00:25.500
to this, either you clicked on
link on the website or you might
subscribing to

00:25.500 --> 00:26.500
it through RSS.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.500
Thank you very much for

00:29.500 --> 00:34.500
I've been thinking a lot about
we need to do with this show in

00:34.500 --> 00:38.500
because I'm even getting pretty
of talking about myself.

00:38.500 --> 00:43.500
And then last night it hit me as
was trying to get to sleep
I had to go to bed

00:43.500 --> 00:50.500
early, only two more days,
and Tuesday, the last two days
the morning show.

00:50.500 --> 00:57.500
And I was thinking that really
maybe at this audio blog or
show can be about,

00:57.500 --> 01:00.500
maybe it can just be really for
and developers to bring them

01:00.500 --> 01:02.500
I mean, I'm...

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
100% a user on all sides of the
equation.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I really like receiving stuff
I like making stuff,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
sending it out as well.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
And I think that so far we've
pretty successful at

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
bringing together a number of
to work on the

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
iPod platform and get stuff

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
And these may not even be
per se.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
These could be just users who
a little more

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
knowledge and experience at
the computers do things

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
that they want them to do.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
So I'm going to see if at all we
make this a

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
platform of its own for users
developers.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
And if you have a comment,
you can leave a

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
comment on the web blog or send
an email

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
adamantcurry.com.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
But maybe if you have something
contribute, you can

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
create your own audio blog post.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Send me a URL point to it and
pick it up.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
And then maybe we can share some
your ideas or

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
questions or stuff that you're
for or things that we

02:04.500 --> 02:08.500
need to make our computers do
how we can connect them all
through the internet.

02:08.500 --> 02:15.500
And I made a very important
yesterday, although the
wiretap for Mac OS

02:15.500 --> 02:20.500
10 had been pointed out to me a
of times by people in my quest
getting the right

02:20.500 --> 02:25.500
audio software to record these

02:25.500 --> 02:29.500
The interface really, I had
it, I think the interface just
me so

02:29.500 --> 02:34.500
much. I didn't realize that it
exactly what I wanted to do,
record all the

02:34.500 --> 02:40.500
audio that would normally come
of my speaker. I want that
digitally just by listening

02:40.500 --> 02:45.500
to the core audio bits or
it is. And that's exactly what
does. I didn't

02:45.500 --> 02:53.500
think it did because when I
at the preferences file and I
it's selected by default,

02:53.500 --> 02:57.500
it says save files to and then
give it a place to save to and
it says

02:57.500 --> 03:03.500
you can add prefix if you want,
can be the aim. And so when I
on the application

03:03.500 --> 03:05.500
name it seemed only to want to
files.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
save files with the application
that was at the front that was

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
So I figured well it only
one application at a time.

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
And then yesterday while I was
the source code, Cindy Camilleri
online on iChat

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
and since she doesn't come
when usually when I am because
are in different, she's

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
in New York and I'm in obviously
Belgium.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
And I always have iChat saying
know, Skipper is here which is
nickname, Skipper.

03:38.000 --> 03:45.000
And I heard the iChat alert that
was online while I was recording
I didn't think that

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
you'd hear it.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
But then I listened back to the
show, yep sure enough it was

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
So I started experimenting and
it records everything.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
So instead of a mixing console
in front of me, I basically have
my applications

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
open that I normally use to play
of audio or use in an audio show
this.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I have three quick time windows

04:07.500 --> 04:14.500
the Rachmaninoff remix which is,
by default now become the tune
source code.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.500
I have a song of the day all
up and also I have iTunes
by in case I think

04:18.500 --> 04:22.500
of something I need to search
iTunes is great for that, just
your search

04:22.500 --> 04:25.500
and immediately you get your

04:25.500 --> 04:32.500
Okay, before I go on to with
about what source code could be
a little update

04:32.500 --> 04:37.500
on iPodder, here's something
came in through my own iPodder,
least I'm using

04:37.500 --> 04:46.500
the get enclosure.pearl script
this came in from, what was
blog digger

04:46.500 --> 04:51.500
and this is from their their
RSS file and apparently some
guy has

04:51.500 --> 04:57.500
written a book called blogs and
name is Don Alfonso and here is
audio

04:57.500 --> 05:01.500
show that was out there on the
somewhere and I just want to
a

05:01.500 --> 05:04.500
little bit of it because it's
of cool to hear Germans talk
web logs.

05:04.500 --> 05:08.500
15.40, you can hear the exact
thing in Germany.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
These texts are only available
the Internet.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
The book is a special logbook
the reader.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
It shows a new world and often
a radical point of view.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
The book is about blogs.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
The title of the book is also
in the beginning of September in
book of Schwarzkopf and

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
A book published by Don Alfonso
Kai...

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
What's the name again?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Don Alfonso?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Kai-Pal.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Exactly.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Kai-Pal.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
The book is about blogs.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
16 webloggers write about text
form on the Internet and why
take over the Internet.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
I love it.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Okay, so if you read German
a book called Blogs.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Blogs is out now in Germany.

05:51.000 --> 06:01.000
Okay, so about the source code,
like to see this turn into some
of a platform

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
where users and developers can
about how we can work together
make our collective lives

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
I know one thing for sure that
of the...

06:10.500 --> 06:15.500
users I know, if they are using
and they use it consistently or
there's a registration

06:15.500 --> 06:16.500
fee.

06:16.500 --> 06:22.500
Most everyone always says the
thing, hey, I want to pay my
and make sure people

06:22.500 --> 06:23.500
get paid.

06:23.500 --> 06:24.500
So I think there is a market

06:24.500 --> 06:30.500
It's probably on a per user
small license fees, but there's
lot of software to be

06:30.500 --> 06:38.500
made and if we can aggregate the
when it comes to per topic,
then

06:38.500 --> 06:44.500
maybe we can get some economies
scale going like has happened
iPodder.

06:44.500 --> 06:50.500
So the history real quick, I
this script, an Apple script
takes a list of

06:50.500 --> 06:57.500
RSS feeds with MP3 enclosures,
those and contrary to popular
by the way,

06:57.500 --> 07:00.500
it does check to see if the file
already been downloaded.

07:00.500 --> 07:04.500
It doesn't download again unless
file has been removed because I
the curl

07:04.500 --> 07:07.500
minus F switch.

07:07.500 --> 07:11.500
It downloads them and then it
them to your iTunes, which if
have a

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
iPod automatically syncs up to
iPod and in iTunes it actually
a playlist which

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
is equal or equivalent to the
of the channel that or the RSS
that you're downloading.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
It takes all that information
the RSS feed.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
So a couple different versions
up.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
We have a Pearl version which
actually using myself now and
is now a Windows

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
version and apparently there's
extra to install, no bits that
need.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
So I'm going to just download
script and it's good to go.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
It's made by Peter Overbeke and
pretty sure he's Dutch.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
I haven't met him other than

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I've linked to him today on my
blog.

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
It's opportunities.nl slash
and he even sent me a ping about
because he's

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
up to, he's done like three
now and it's really ready to be

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
So please give Peter's script a
because if we can get this
for Windows, and

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
by the way it works with the
the Windows version of iTunes.

08:13.500 --> 08:21.500
If we can get this working, then
concept of an iPod platform,
all mp3 devices,

08:21.500 --> 08:28.500
that can download stuff without
doing anything and just have
ready for you, I think

08:28.500 --> 08:34.500
we're just on the verge of a
potential being unleashed here.

08:34.500 --> 08:39.500
So again, if you could, and I've
to it on my web blog, check out
iPodder

08:39.500 --> 08:44.500
for Windows and let's say get
feedback on how it's doing and
it's working and if it's

08:44.500 --> 08:49.500
performing. And then of course,
next step, which is needed for
platforms, both for

08:49.500 --> 08:56.500
Windows and the Mac, and for
and anything else that we can
that people have this desire,

08:56.500 --> 09:07.500
is getting the shows, the mp3s
iTunes to non-ipod mp3 players.
I have a feeling

09:07.500 --> 09:13.500
that's going to be a little bit
challenging. So just about at
end for today, yes, that was

09:13.500 --> 09:16.500
really long time.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
them. As I said, I'm trying to
these around 15 minutes, which
you know, just believing

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
in Andy Warhol's vision.

09:22.000 --> 09:31.000
Today, 14 years ago, Patricia
to me and said, we need to get
child up. And

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
we knew that we were going to
a C-section way ahead of time
Christina was a

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
breach. And we went to the
and Dr. Ladosi was there and Dr.
the wife

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
Sony with an eye at the
St. Barnabas in New Jersey. And
said, okay,

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
you know, we're gonna have this
today. And it was around seven
and it was

09:52.000 --> 09:59.000
a really great vibe in the
room. And as the doctor
picked

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
Christina up out of Patricia, it
just an amazing sight. On the
it

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
was Light FM was on and the
in my life started to play. And
was

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
something that we will never,
forget. Now, of course, it would
easy for me

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
to play.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.500
the Beatles right now and we'd
have an emotional moment.

10:19.500 --> 10:26.500
But since my daughter,
turns 14 today, I figure I'd
her since she does

10:26.500 --> 10:30.500
share the bar slash recording
slash computer room with me.

10:30.500 --> 10:35.500
I'd honor her by playing the
new song by her favorite band.

10:35.500 --> 10:39.500
And of course, I need to remind
that you do have to vote for
for the viewers'

10:39.500 --> 10:45.500
choice for the upcoming MTV
Music Awards, which I believe
next Wednesday.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.500
They're all time favorite and
met these guys.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.500
They are great, broke, bunch of
very, very talented.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.500
Is Good Charlotte.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.500
Check out their new one,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I'm still I don't know why

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I'm not switchin'

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
I knew it all along

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
You're so predictable

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
I knew something would go wrong

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
It's all a way back

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
So you don't have to call

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
I'll say anything at all

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
You're so predictable

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
You're so predictable

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
So take your red tip

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
It's your broken promises

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
And all the time you stole

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Because I am done with this

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
I can give it away, give it away

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
I'm doing everything I should've

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
And now I'm making a change

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
I'm living to death

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I'm giving back what you gave it

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I don't need anything

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
I knew it all along

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
You're so predictable

12:19.500 --> 12:21.500
I did something with you

12:21.500 --> 12:25.500
I'm in the middle of a fight

12:25.500 --> 12:28.500
I see you now, I have to go

12:28.500 --> 12:31.500
I say anything at all

12:31.500 --> 12:34.500
So free to bow

12:34.500 --> 12:37.500
I'm in the middle of a fight

12:37.500 --> 12:39.500
Everyone needs every time I

12:39.500 --> 12:41.500
I'm in the middle of a fight

12:41.500 --> 12:43.500
I'm so broken, I'm so cold

12:43.500 --> 12:45.500
I'm so hurt inside, I'm so

12:45.500 --> 12:48.500
I'm afraid of, I don't even know

12:48.500 --> 12:50.500
The story's been running out of

12:50.500 --> 12:52.500
I'm searching for a way

12:52.500 --> 12:54.500
I'm dreaming you won't come back

12:54.500 --> 12:56.500
I want you in my story

12:56.500 --> 12:58.500
I'm ready to come and fight

13:01.500 --> 13:23.500
I knew it all along, you're so
to phone I knew something would
wrong, and I'm fine

13:23.500 --> 13:33.500
You don't have to call, I'll say
at all, so pretty to phone

13:46.500 --> 13:55.500
Good Charlotte, predictable.

13:55.500 --> 14:00.500
And believe me, I am just
for as long as possible the fact
my daughter

14:00.500 --> 14:02.500
and I actually like a lot of the
music.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.500
So that's their new one.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.500
And be on the lookout for the

14:07.500 --> 14:08.500
Right.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.500
Okay, that's it for the source
for today.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.500
Just within my 15 minute time
weekend coming up.

14:13.500 --> 14:18.500
And then two more shows Monday
Tuesday, got a big party.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.500
And then my new life starts.

14:19.500 --> 14:24.500
And I can get to, well, the one
I want to start doing is having
source code up

14:24.500 --> 14:31.500
and available every morning
preferably before 8 o'clock East
time in the United

14:31.500 --> 14:32.500
States.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.500
All right, well, have yourselves
great weekend.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
Hopefully you'll check out the
this Saturday and Sunday.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.500
If not, talk to you on Monday
have a good one.

14:40.500 --> 14:40.500
Bye-bye.

14:48.000 --> 15:12.000
The power of your intelligence.

15:12.000 --> 15:22.000
The power of your intelligence.
