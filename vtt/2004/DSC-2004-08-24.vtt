WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:18.000
It's the source code and it is
August 24th 2004 coming to you
Curry Castle

00:18.000 --> 00:22.700
in Belgium which well this may
the last week it's actually
Curry Castle but

00:22.700 --> 00:29.100
I have more news about that
and then apology right up front
I signed

00:29.100 --> 00:31.900
off on the show by saying we'll
you tomorrow on Wednesday in the
of

00:31.900 --> 00:37.460
the week hump day yeah right I
I was extremely tired so
of course

00:37.460 --> 00:43.140
will be Wednesday today was
well very busy day Patricia and
were

00:43.140 --> 00:49.420
interviewed by Rina Ulamans who
a show here called Pulse which
I'm

00:49.420 --> 00:56.940
trying to think when you compare
to well and it's they do a
of us

00:56.940 --> 01:01.140
and they do a profile of the
every single week and so they're
up

01:01.140 --> 01:04.940
the first new

01:03.000 --> 01:08.040
show of the new series September
and we're going to be in it. So
was there at the radio

01:08.040 --> 01:12.920
show in the morning. The camera
was there at quarter to six as I
at the studio.

01:12.920 --> 01:18.760
And well, I can't wait to see
I actually look at that time in
morning.

01:18.760 --> 01:27.880
Let's see just a brief rundown
stuff that's been going on. Oh,
see that Joe Ito obviously

01:27.880 --> 01:33.880
caught the source code maybe a
or a couple days after I
it. I don't know if you

01:33.880 --> 01:39.640
remember I mentioned that he had
video of the rocket car of
The death-defying stunt that

01:39.640 --> 01:44.760
I performed for ABC's Circus of
Stars looks like he doesn't have
video anymore and he's

01:44.760 --> 01:50.120
actually put the word out to see
anyone still has it. I wish I
I could find a copy of that.

01:50.120 --> 01:56.760
It's one of my favorite quick
I don't really have a theme for
show other than

01:56.760 --> 02:03.880
or just a couple of loose
that I put together. One thing
I've that I noticed in the

02:04.500 --> 02:06.920
I'm gonna open up a soda here.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.120
Ahh... have a coconut smile.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.120
Thanks for watching. I'll see
in the next video. Bye!

02:15.000 --> 02:23.600
One thing I noticed with the
work that I've been doing, and
had glasses

02:23.600 --> 02:26.320
since I was 18 or 19.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.320
I probably should have had them
a couple of years prior to that,
just never really

02:29.320 --> 02:30.320
knew.

02:30.320 --> 02:37.440
Currently negative to 7, 2.75,
2.0.

02:37.440 --> 02:41.280
And I did through the radio

02:41.280 --> 02:46.280
There's a big chain store of
and contact lenses.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.560
And they needed someone to do a
for them that was going to last
week.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.960
And I said, what the hell?

02:50.960 --> 02:53.440
Why don't you give me a year's
of contact lenses?

02:53.440 --> 02:59.040
Because I've been wearing
lenses for, oh man, the past 15
probably.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.520
And so they said, well, you know

03:00.520 --> 03:02.480
We're so happy that you're going
do that for us.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.800
We're going to give you the
lenses.

03:03.800 --> 03:08.160
We've got these new plasma-ized,
extended wear.

03:08.160 --> 03:14.160
We're going to give you a new
of regular glasses and a pair of
as well, which

03:14.160 --> 03:16.480
will be sunglasses cut to my

03:16.500 --> 03:24.900
strength. And so, you know, we
went through, I normally have no
for that.

03:24.900 --> 03:28.700
I had the ugliest pair of
up until now in just a reserve
you know, from

03:28.700 --> 03:33.620
bottom in 1972 that are about to
back into fashion. So it really
our time

03:33.620 --> 03:38.220
and picked up some nice frames
really looked at the color of
glass for the sunglasses

03:38.220 --> 03:44.100
and went through all the
So I've been wearing my new
I haven't been

03:44.100 --> 03:47.940
wearing the contact lenses for a
weeks now. And what I've really
because

03:47.940 --> 03:53.020
I did put in some lenses the
day, is it makes a difference.
just work better.

03:53.020 --> 03:57.540
The technology of contact still
made it as far as I'm concerned.

03:57.540 --> 04:03.900
driving, I notice a big
And really, we've gone through
the motions of getting

04:03.900 --> 04:11.380
just the right type of lenses
my eye and curvature and
There's just no comparison.

04:11.380 --> 04:15.580
And particularly when it comes
developing and doing stuff on
computer, the clarity

04:15.580 --> 04:17.980
on the screen. It's also big big

04:18.000 --> 04:24.080
different. And I wonder if
else had experienced that the
between looking

04:24.080 --> 04:31.760
at a screen and working and even
with contact lenses or glasses.
me, big difference.

04:31.760 --> 04:38.560
On the development front, you
seen on my web blog, I've posted
list of the current

04:38.560 --> 04:46.080
iPod or scripts that are
to be a part of the iPod
which we seem to be somehow

04:46.080 --> 04:53.680
cobbling together. I've been
David's Get Enclosures Pearl
I've installed it as a

04:53.680 --> 05:01.440
Cron script. I had to tweak out
stuff because it was looking for
feeds file and couldn't find

05:01.440 --> 05:06.960
it the way I'd set up the Cron
So fix that. And it's happily
twice a day. I set it up

05:06.960 --> 05:11.680
for 3 a.m. So that's just before
get up. And so, you know, if
needs to be downloaded,

05:11.680 --> 05:19.200
be ready for me before I leave
for 30. And then it runs at 6
because I always, you know,

05:19.500 --> 05:22.840
check after dinner.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.480
And it's working great.

05:24.480 --> 05:30.400
And it's giving me some ideas
how I can continue to update the
version of

05:30.400 --> 05:31.540
the iPod or Apple script.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
And let's see, got a piece of
that I wanted to share with you.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
Oh yeah, this is from Gordon,
Gordon.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
And Gordon says he's been
to the source code.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
And he did send me an email
about the size of the audio

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Of course, now that I've got a
recording system set up,

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
which I think the quality is way
superior to the Mac.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
And the mic isn't crapping out.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
And it's really a nice sound to

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
As he was complaining that he
to download the source code on a
modem link,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
and it takes an hour and 45

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
And he says, well, he only
just before I left my drive to

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
And he really would like me to
sample to my usual 64 kilobit
rate instead of 160.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
But I did want to talk about
for a second because I think
is exactly the point.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.400
If we can set up these scripts
iPod or to run at night.

06:34.500 --> 06:39.500
and just be reliable about it
just make sure that it happens.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.460
It shouldn't matter if it takes
hour and 45 minutes

06:42.460 --> 06:46.820
or five hours and 45 minutes as
as you sleep long enough

06:46.820 --> 06:49.220
and have it set up to run when
asleep.

06:49.220 --> 06:50.900
I think that's the beauty of it.

06:50.900 --> 06:54.020
And the way it shouldn't work,

06:54.020 --> 06:58.260
and which is exactly why I like
Get Enclosures Pearl script,

06:58.260 --> 07:01.060
is that you hit a button and
for it to come in.

07:01.060 --> 07:03.140
This has to be running
on your machine,

07:03.140 --> 07:04.220
you have to forget about it.

07:04.220 --> 07:09.220
That's why I like Pearl script
shell scripts

07:09.220 --> 07:12.500
and Python scripts is because
don't have to launch

07:12.500 --> 07:13.340
an application.

07:13.340 --> 07:15.100
It's not sitting there in your
saying,

07:15.100 --> 07:17.700
hi, I'm running, I don't want to
about it.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.100
I want another application,
iTunes,

07:20.100 --> 07:22.420
to pop up and say, hey, I got
new stuff.

07:22.420 --> 07:24.660
Good morning, I'm ready for your

07:24.660 --> 07:26.780
So a little bit of pushback on

07:26.780 --> 07:28.340
their dog now on the other hand.

07:28.340 --> 07:31.620
Doug says that he's written,

07:31.620 --> 07:33.260
he removed three lines of code

07:33.260 --> 07:35.980
has rewritten Dave Sloshers
closure.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
and it works on Linux now.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
So I hope he publishes that,
forward to it.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Of course, I'll link to that, so
have yet another platform coming
board.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
And what we need now, of course,
we need Windows.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And I have no idea how to do it.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
I'm lost.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And of course, I can operate

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
I have a Windows machine here,
I have no idea if there's an
to Apple script.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
I think there's something called
Scripting Host or something like

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Maybe we can use that, but then
still have our devices problem.

08:08.000 --> 08:16.000
Sure, there's lots of iPods out
and lots of iTunes floating

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
But can we write for all
MP3 playing devices?

08:21.000 --> 08:28.000
Or maybe we should write for
and have, and hopefully iTunes
start syncing up with all these

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
We really need to get to the
where people like Gordon don't
to think about how long it's

08:33.000 --> 08:36.440
It takes 10 minutes or it takes
hours.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.520
We'll get to that point.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.540
We're going to get to the point
it's going to be video and
all other kinds

08:40.540 --> 08:42.340
of issues we have to look at.

08:42.340 --> 08:45.060
But same thing, it's just going
take time to download.

08:45.060 --> 08:51.820
And that's this time shifting,
magical bandwidth that we create
we're sleeping.

08:51.820 --> 08:55.460
We use time that we wouldn't use
than sleeping.

08:55.460 --> 09:00.580
And so let's put that time to
good use.

09:00.580 --> 09:07.300
So that's from the old email bag
of what is not span that comes

09:07.300 --> 09:13.740
I told you, I don't know if I
that we went to Christina's
her new school,

09:13.740 --> 09:16.760
I think I did about the Antwerp
School.

09:16.760 --> 09:23.220
And we were looking at the list
stuff she has to have, what pens
pencils and agenda.

09:23.220 --> 09:26.740
And of course you can buy that
the campus bookstore.

09:26.740 --> 09:35.980
But they also require that each
has a 128 megabyte USB plug-in

09:35.980 --> 09:39.020
And one of those keychain things
put in your pocket.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.440
and they actually sell them on

09:41.440 --> 09:45.960
And this is a part of how the
system works here now

09:45.960 --> 09:48.360
with the international school.

09:48.360 --> 09:51.480
You take your work home on your
portable drive.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.040
I just blew me away.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.960
I thought that was extremely

09:54.960 --> 09:59.960
So to wind up today, I want to
a song of the day

09:59.960 --> 10:01.600
and it's an appropriate one,

10:01.600 --> 10:04.000
because I think that we have
the house.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.120
We've gotten down to the final
on the price.

10:07.120 --> 10:11.120
So that's just a matter of whose
is bigger.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.880
Of course it would be mine.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.920
And with a little bit of luck,
have news

10:16.920 --> 10:20.000
that we are going to start our
and get everything in motion

10:20.000 --> 10:21.680
very, very soon.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.360
And Patricia and I were just
about it.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.360
And of course we've walked

10:27.360 --> 10:31.960
We have about 20 acres worth of
here and gardens.

10:31.960 --> 10:36.080
And we are definitely going to
this place, that's for sure.

10:36.080 --> 10:40.440
And we've moved several times
and we like it and we like
to new challenges and new

10:40.500 --> 10:46.780
but we never quite had a nature
like house like this one. If I
pick it up

10:46.780 --> 10:53.300
and move it to the UK, I would
a heartbeat. So this is a song
I think anyone who's

10:53.300 --> 10:57.740
ever moved and we probably all
it one point or another. You
feel a bit

10:57.740 --> 10:59.980
like this song describes.

10:59.980 --> 11:14.780
I like the fire. You place the
in the vase that you bore today.

11:14.780 --> 11:32.580
Steering at the fire, the
flowers, my eyes. They go to the
all night long.

11:32.580 --> 11:42.020
Only for me.

11:42.000 --> 12:07.000
To me now, you rest you have
my lips, everything. Such a
serious, cold, windows are
by me.

12:07.000 --> 12:17.120
Such a cold, serious, cold,

12:17.120 --> 12:24.000
only for you.

12:24.000 --> 12:33.500
A house is a very, very, very
house with two cats in the yard.

is easy to solve you.
