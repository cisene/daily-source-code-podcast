00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Well, good morning, everybody,
welcome to the Daily Source

00:07.000 --> 00:12.320
Thank you very much for taking
time to download this mp3 file,
if some of you

00:12.320 --> 00:17.680
may have received it
overnight as an enclosure in
aggregator.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.920
In that case, thanks for

00:20.920 --> 00:26.380
The first, what I'd like to do
explain exactly what this is,
the Daily Source

00:26.380 --> 00:30.320
Code is going to be, and well,
the name already suggests, it's
that's

00:30.320 --> 00:32.500
going to be daily.

00:32.500 --> 00:38.480
And I'd like to elaborate a
bit on the name Daily Source
and what inspired

00:38.480 --> 00:40.320
me to do this, where that came

00:40.320 --> 00:43.740
By the way, I'm recording this
my car.

00:43.740 --> 00:51.220
I'm on the way from our home in
to Breda in the Netherlands.

00:51.220 --> 00:53.980
Pick up new pair of glasses and
with...

00:53.980 --> 00:54.980
Oops.

00:54.980 --> 00:57.020
It's a very important carriage.

00:57.020 --> 00:58.860
I think I'm going to have to
another route.

00:58.860 --> 01:01.540
Anyway, the Daily Source Code.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.780
Let me back up here for a

01:04.780 --> 01:09.860
I'm in a very narrow country
and there's a horse and drawn
coming my way.

01:09.860 --> 01:11.660
So you know what?

01:11.660 --> 01:17.100
I'm going to just step over here
while I'm talking to you guys,
just wait for

01:17.100 --> 01:21.460
this guy to pass.

01:21.460 --> 01:26.700
When I was on vacation just
in Sorrento, Italy, a couple of
things happened.

01:26.700 --> 01:34.380
First of all, as if by magic, my
microphone, which I had lost for
few months,

01:34.380 --> 01:36.980
I had the receiver apart but I
couldn't find the microphone

01:36.980 --> 01:42.580
It was left over from our
show that we taped over a year
and I bought a couple

01:42.580 --> 01:44.540
of really professional wireless
kits.

01:44.540 --> 01:46.300
It cost about $2,000 each.

01:46.300 --> 01:49.660
So this is great, has great
and has a great sound.

01:49.660 --> 01:50.980
It's just fantastic.

01:50.980 --> 01:54.140
Professional stuff.

01:54.140 --> 01:59.320
So I found that in a suitcase
had been lurking there
for a couple of months

01:59.320 --> 02:02.340
I thought, well, alright, now I
finally start doing some audio
again.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
But also, I'd loaded up my iPod.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
You may or may not know that I
created a couple of scripts that

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
parse some RSS feeds with
and automatically downloads

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
the MP3 files and adds them to
iTunes library and to my iPod.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm subscribed to the IT
feed.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
And so I loaded that up.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Wave to this guy here. Sure,
Happy to do it.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I loaded it up.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
And on there was a couple of
or a couple of sessions

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
from the open source developers
I believe.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
And I forgot who the speaker

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
Of course, I'll be sure to find
and link to him.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I was talking about what source
really is.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
Is source code the actual script
runs that makes your computer

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
do something or the machine code
sits underneath all that?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Or is the source code perhaps?

03:04.500 --> 03:12.500
actually the written
the English explanation, not
funky English that a computer
interpret,

03:12.500 --> 03:16.500
that explains what a program is
to do.

03:16.500 --> 03:24.500
And I kind of subscribe to that
that maybe even an RFC or just a
description of,

03:24.500 --> 03:29.500
okay, here's what I want this
program to do, here's how it
behave.

03:29.500 --> 03:36.500
That is the actual source code,
the thought behind what
gets written in computer code or
language.

03:36.500 --> 03:44.500
So if you think about a radio
or an audio program like this,
could, coincidentally, it's also
a program, right?

03:44.500 --> 03:49.500
I guess you could say that this
the source code to me.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.500
It's Adam's source code.

03:51.500 --> 03:58.500
And every single day, a bit of
is filtered through to the web,
I write about what I'm thinking,
I've been reading.

03:58.500 --> 04:06.500
You know, the links that I
the sites that I choose to link
all that comes from a certain
on the website.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.800
on any given day or moment, and
what I call the source code.

04:09.800 --> 04:17.040
So I figured if I have a web log
I've got all these links and
it might

04:17.040 --> 04:21.320
be of some interest to some
to listen to the source code
all the ideas come

04:21.320 --> 04:22.320
from.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.120
The narrative that's running
in my head that I can't possibly
down.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.080
other inspiration has been Dave
who started doing his morning
notes in

04:34.080 --> 04:40.220
audio a while ago, and he did
a daily version during the
of the Democratic

04:40.220 --> 04:51.040
National Convention. And I'm
to it. I just love listening to
source code, basically.

04:51.040 --> 04:58.680
And his latest coffee notes,
he actually pleaded people to
to, he made a very

04:58.680 --> 05:02.480
good point, which he and I have
before, and I think I've written
it

05:02.480 --> 05:10.680
on the web as well, is that
coming to a head between
and journalists.

05:10.680 --> 05:16.880
And it's all really about, on a
in Belgium here we stop at the,
stop for

05:16.880 --> 05:20.320
pedestrians. Sure, man.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.260
recollect my thoughts here for a

05:24.260 --> 05:25.420
I didn't want to hit anybody.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.180
This is kind of tough.

05:26.180 --> 05:27.180
Hold on, let me just spark up.

05:27.180 --> 05:29.820
About a half hour drive-out.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.500
I'm trying to make this 15

05:33.500 --> 05:37.140
So at any rate

05:37.140 --> 05:40.220
The big

05:40.220 --> 05:45.620
Revelation really of the promise
the web which they've says I
correctly is not necessarily web

05:45.620 --> 05:50.420
It's the fact that when you
something you can link to the

05:50.420 --> 05:52.220
so

05:52.220 --> 05:56.860
If you interpreted something
someone wrote in a certain way
you have an opinion about it

05:57.220 --> 06:02.440
You can write that and then kind
the unwritten rule is you link
the source and then people can

06:02.440 --> 06:05.680
Form their own opinion and agree
disagree with you

06:05.680 --> 06:07.500
that's one of the beauties of
web and

06:07.500 --> 06:13.880
It doesn't work that way in
journalism because there is just
way to link in a radio show or

06:13.880 --> 06:21.200
Television show or certainly not
a print publication. Well, I
you could print a URL

06:21.200 --> 06:26.040
But it's not quite the same it
give your readers the same
access to check out the source

06:26.220 --> 06:29.220
And I was listening to that and
was thinking, you know, wow,
so true.

06:31.500 --> 06:37.020
interview so many times,
in the Netherlands where my wife
I are very well

06:37.020 --> 06:43.820
known and are written about all
time in, unfortunately, usually
a tabloid magazine.

06:43.820 --> 06:48.700
Sometimes there's a serious
but it really doesn't matter
writing it or who

06:48.700 --> 06:53.980
did the interview or what
the journalist comes with. Once
read it in print, it's never

06:53.980 --> 07:02.380
100% what you intended or the
you said it and it often has,
often opinionated by the

07:02.380 --> 07:07.180
journalist, the writer, which is
okay, but there's no link to the
The sources,

07:07.180 --> 07:12.220
in that case, would be the
that we had for the interview,
could be anywhere

07:12.220 --> 07:17.660
from half hour on the phone to,
I've had interviews, for
the big Playboy magazine

07:17.660 --> 07:25.260
interview that takes two days,
a photo session. And that's
down to X number of words

07:25.260 --> 07:30.380
that the journalist has allotted
the space that is available for
story.

07:30.380 --> 07:31.980
It's a deer.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.980
Thanks for watching!

07:36.000 --> 07:41.280
So as I was thinking about that,
was something that I wanted to
about, which

07:41.280 --> 07:45.560
I will, but again, this is just
daily source code, so I'm kind
distilling through the

07:45.560 --> 07:46.920
thoughts right now.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.280
I found something that was
useful.

07:49.280 --> 07:55.000
I got so sick and tired of
just writing crap about us and
information and just

07:55.000 --> 07:58.400
you know, they couldn't even get
age right most of the time.

07:58.400 --> 08:03.080
Which usually was to my

08:03.080 --> 08:08.600
I remember there was a, at a
point, there was a big thing and
wrote about

08:08.600 --> 08:14.560
some supposed tax inquiry that
going on into my business

08:14.560 --> 08:17.880
That was on the front page of
newspapers, another newspapers,
know, pick up the

08:17.880 --> 08:24.640
story and it was on the news
and all the actual errors would
pass from one

08:24.640 --> 08:27.000
to the next, like the kids' game
telephone.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.440
In fact, they usually got a
bit worse as one publication
another.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.480
And there was another large

08:37.500 --> 08:42.880
the newspaper that said, well,
really want to interview you and
wife about what's

08:42.880 --> 08:47.020
going on and what's happening. I
you know, that's fine. Are you
going to

08:47.020 --> 08:52.620
record the interview? It was for
newspaper. So a lot of, I'd say
out of ten journalists

08:52.620 --> 08:58.620
record their interviews on
still on a cassette player,
cassette player.

08:58.620 --> 09:03.700
Some good little funky and have
new fast, new fangled gadgets
maybe a mini-disk,

09:03.700 --> 09:10.700
but very few MP3 recorders out
Really just more memo recording
And I said,

09:10.700 --> 09:14.660
well, yeah, of course we're
to say, well, you know what, I'm
to record

09:14.660 --> 09:22.540
our interview as well. And I'm
to reserve the right to publish
And that was something

09:22.540 --> 09:27.100
new. They agreed to it, which I
was absolutely the right thing
do. But they

09:27.100 --> 09:31.460
were definitely a little bit
out about this new concept. But
mean, when you think

09:31.460 --> 09:37.180
about it, hey, you know, you're
me, what gives you the right to
the only one?

09:37.180 --> 09:39.020
I mean, I should be able to
our conversation.

09:39.000 --> 09:48.120
to. And I figured that that way
they start printing all kinds of
incorrect bits,

09:48.120 --> 09:53.120
or maybe even if they just
it incorrectly, I would be able
point to the

09:53.120 --> 09:59.720
source, the source code of that
and say, here you go. These guys
misunderstood

09:59.720 --> 10:07.320
me or they took this out of
And I have to add something that
happens is

10:07.320 --> 10:11.560
I may have explained it poorly.
may have not communicated
that in a certain

10:11.560 --> 10:17.000
way and that just came out
That happens probably most
One second buddy,

10:17.000 --> 10:23.560
you want to move in here? Wow,
this in the car really makes me
very nice and

10:23.560 --> 10:34.640
courteous road user. Okay, this
the big trash truck. All right,
When the article

10:34.640 --> 10:39.880
came out, by the way, and most
well, not most, but many
will give you

10:40.500 --> 10:46.300
read the story before it's
and change anything. And said,
know, they did ask

10:46.300 --> 10:51.020
a couple follow up questions
the phone later. And the article
good. And I don't

10:51.020 --> 10:56.260
believe there was, I mean, you
really change any article sound
way you want

10:56.260 --> 11:02.420
it to sound. But when it comes
the facts, these guys are really
their toes. They

11:02.420 --> 11:08.900
had recorded themselves and it
two guys did the interview. And
came out very well.

11:08.900 --> 11:13.100
And I think that part of that
because they knew that they
had to be on their

11:13.100 --> 11:17.820
toes and get it right because I
publish the source code. I never
did publish

11:17.820 --> 11:22.580
the source code. I still have
I felt that, you know, that just
necessary. And

11:22.580 --> 11:30.140
in fact, just the idea that I
worked. So when you think about
that way, which

11:30.140 --> 11:41.600
is a great way that journalists
their sources can work together
make better to

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
better results. Something that
who is ever interviewed might
to consider

11:47.000 --> 11:50.520
doing. So I just flipped that
and said, well, hold on a

11:52.500 --> 11:53.940
I've got source code.

11:53.940 --> 11:56.980
The source code is what's
around in my head.

11:56.980 --> 12:01.860
And it's what I'm reading and
I'm linking to and what my
are.

12:01.860 --> 12:03.340
And I should make that

12:03.340 --> 12:05.980
The only thing that's going to
is what just bandwidth.

12:05.980 --> 12:09.780
I mean, I have so much time to
stuff.

12:09.780 --> 12:11.580
I mean, the car a lot.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.580
But it's really no effort.

12:13.580 --> 12:15.900
And of course, I'm going to...

12:15.900 --> 12:19.580
And it gives me another
to write a couple of nifty
that automates the

12:19.580 --> 12:26.660
whole bit and does the ID3 tags
posts it to the right place and
it to my RSS

12:26.660 --> 12:27.660
feed as an enclosure.

12:27.660 --> 12:32.780
So all of that, of course, is
fun part for me is a fledgling
and program

12:32.780 --> 12:35.140
or maybe I should say a

12:35.140 --> 12:39.300
But again, you get all the
code for me if you're interested
it and you don't

12:39.300 --> 12:40.900
have to listen to it at all.

12:40.900 --> 12:43.900
You won't really lose it.

12:43.900 --> 12:50.500
So another reason that I'm doing
and I do plan on it being daily
that I like doing

12:50.500 --> 12:51.660
audio or radio.

12:51.660 --> 12:54.020
I've been doing a morning radio

12:54.000 --> 13:01.160
for almost a full year as of
31st. I've done it for a full
for

13:01.160 --> 13:06.400
Radio Veronica in the
who asked me about a year ago
this time

13:06.400 --> 13:11.920
if I could fill in for a month
their new morning guy could get
his

13:11.920 --> 13:16.320
contract at a competing radio
and I can't even when they ask

13:16.320 --> 13:20.920
damn you know a month of getting
at 3.30 in the morning to do a
from 6 to 9

13:20.920 --> 13:27.800
I don't know if I last three
the month went okay and I really
into it

13:27.800 --> 13:31.920
and I was enjoying it and a
show is it's kind of like this
know

13:31.920 --> 13:36.760
you're talking to people you're
them wake up and talking about

13:36.760 --> 13:41.160
stuff it's just what's going on
the world what's going on in the

13:41.160 --> 13:44.800
community which is the country
the Netherlands and I guess the

13:44.800 --> 13:48.680
is a global community so you can
about all kinds of stuff and we
a

13:48.680 --> 13:53.840
great time on that show I mean
took the ratings up sky-high
in just

13:53.840 --> 13:56.680
a couple of months by

13:55.500 --> 14:02.000
taking the entire show on the
for a week and broadcast live
Camp Smitty and Asamawa, Iraq,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.500
where the Dutch Marines were

14:04.500 --> 14:08.500
And it was just a blast, you

14:08.500 --> 14:12.500
And really it's just talking and
a little bit of music.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.500
So that ends.

14:14.500 --> 14:22.500
Oh, well, so the morning guy for
number of personal reasons
make it to the station,

14:22.500 --> 14:28.500
and they kept saying, well, oh,
station management kept asking
to extend by another week

14:28.500 --> 14:29.500
or another month.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.500
I said, well, you know what, why
we just say we'll do this for a
year,

14:32.500 --> 14:35.500
so I can actually build
and create something.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
And that's my traffic alert.
this out.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.500
Very in navel, direct restoque
tar fesperz.

14:40.500 --> 14:44.500
Travo glan zam rifin a tarpo
van ai dresou van vediam.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.500
D'imitin van ai d'imitin van ai

14:46.500 --> 14:50.500
Okay, that's a traffic report
and it happens automatically on

14:50.500 --> 14:55.500
So we did it for a full year and
winding down two more weeks.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.500
So a little bit over.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.440
Yeah, a little over two weeks
then I'll be a free man for
1st and Patricia

15:02.440 --> 15:09.640
and I and our daughter Christina
coming 14 in just a week and a
We decided that

15:09.640 --> 15:16.440
we want to change. Part of it
health reasons. Trish was
with heart disease earlier

15:16.440 --> 15:25.400
this year. Not as horrible
as it sounds, but easy for me to
I guess. But it's not like

15:25.400 --> 15:30.520
she has massive heart failure
disease but she has to pay
to her life and

15:30.520 --> 15:39.400
what she's doing and is on
and has to keep a very healthy
And we want to

15:39.400 --> 15:45.640
change to really get into that
so we've decided that we're
to move and we're going to move

15:45.640 --> 15:55.960
out of the the Benalux and we've
the United Kingdom. So we've put
our both houses up for

15:55.960 --> 15:58.360
sale the one in Amsterdam which
affectionately call the

15:58.500 --> 16:03.780
that's actually been on the
for about two and a half, almost
years now.

16:03.780 --> 16:08.920
The market is completely dead in
of Europe, I guess, and
for big luxury

16:08.920 --> 16:09.920
houses.

16:09.920 --> 16:16.100
There's just, ah, there's no
really, unless of course you're
to lower

16:16.100 --> 16:21.860
your price, there's always a
for something if they're

16:21.860 --> 16:25.180
We have the Castle in Belgium,
you've now put on the market.

16:25.180 --> 16:30.460
I've already had a lot of
for that, of course it was also
the set, if you

16:30.460 --> 16:34.340
will, for our reality show.

16:34.340 --> 16:40.200
So a lot of people are familiar
it and we're pretty hopeful that
move relatively

16:40.200 --> 16:41.200
quickly.

16:41.200 --> 16:45.020
Price to sell, as they say,
house for entertaining

16:45.020 --> 16:47.540
And then we're off and then
going to go to the UK.

16:47.540 --> 16:52.140
We're not, well, we know the
area where we want to be, which
be south of

16:52.140 --> 16:58.820
London, but within a reasonable
or train ride into the city.

16:58.820 --> 16:59.940
And I

17:00.000 --> 17:07.720
a totally open agenda. There's
that I have to do. Well, first I
to remember

17:07.720 --> 17:12.800
what it's like to sleep in. You
not have to set the alarm clock
3.30 in the

17:12.800 --> 17:18.720
morning. But just by saying
going to make this change,
things have happened.

17:18.720 --> 17:25.680
I'm getting all kinds of new,
creative ideas. In addition,
been asked to write

17:25.680 --> 17:30.120
a book. All kinds of things are
coming together. So I'm really
forward to

17:30.120 --> 17:34.400
that in a way. It feels like I'm
my freedom back. The one thing I
want to

17:34.400 --> 17:42.560
try to do is to do these daily
code, audio, blog posts. And I
it would be

17:42.560 --> 17:48.840
since they're in English and to
an excellent advantage as a time
goes. I'm going

17:48.840 --> 17:56.400
to try and have these up by, I
7 a.m. New York time. So if
driving to work

17:56.400 --> 18:01.220
and you have your download or
downloading the

18:01.500 --> 18:05.500
The MP3's from the RSS feed.

18:05.500 --> 18:09.500
You'll have something to listen
on your morning commute.

18:09.500 --> 18:14.500
That probably really won't be
until the first of September
I'm not doing

18:14.500 --> 18:16.500
the morning show.

18:16.500 --> 18:21.500
I just can't see getting, you
being done on the morning show
night in the

18:21.500 --> 18:23.500
morning, my time.

18:23.500 --> 18:29.500
I'm usually not home before to,
know, only give me a very small
before,

18:29.500 --> 18:31.500
well, actually that would
be too late.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.500
That would be 8 a.m. New York

18:33.500 --> 18:37.500
So these will probably be up
9 or 10 a.m.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.500
for the couple of weeks, first
of weeks.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.500
It also gives me a chance to
out what I want to do with them.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.500
One of the thoughts I had for
was to do a song of the day.

18:45.500 --> 18:50.500
Just get you going with one song
I think either fits in with the
of the day

18:50.500 --> 18:54.500
or the news of the day or the
of the world or state of

18:54.500 --> 18:56.500
So I'm looking forward to that.

18:56.500 --> 19:00.500
And again, it'll be what's going
in my mind.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.500
What am I thinking about?

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
And by that time, I probably
five to eight entries on my web

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
And this will be the source code
that, what I was thinking about.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
Which is pretty much on par for
I've posted today.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
So that's the general idea.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Um...

19:24.000 --> 19:34.000
As you can tell, there's a lot
talk of RSS and enclosures and
in this first daily source code.

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
You may or may not have read
I've been programming a little
been working in user talk,

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
which is scripting language that
with Frontier and Radio User

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
and also been doing some work in
Script,

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
which allows you to script your
to do things automatically.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
And a little bit of Python,
I haven't delved into that as
as I want to.

20:00.000 --> 20:10.000
But I'm really working on a
that'll make this a little bit
when it comes to downloading
under your iPod.

20:10.000 --> 20:16.000
I have a kind of a beta version
now, and I'm subscribed to a big

20:16.000 --> 20:26.000
One is the IT conversations,
is great because almost every
there's a new interview or panel
session coming up.

20:25.500 --> 20:29.740
down the pipe and it's right
my iPod in the morning on my
commute to

20:29.740 --> 20:33.140
the radio station. I just
you know, I didn't have to do
I didn't have

20:33.140 --> 20:37.900
to click or wait, just pick up
iPod in the morning, throw the
on, the earphones

20:37.900 --> 20:45.660
in and there's something there.
of course Dave's morning coffee
is in there and

20:45.660 --> 20:50.540
something called blog, was it
digger or blog digger? I'd have
look that up, which

20:50.540 --> 21:00.460
is an RSS 2.0 feed with audio
It comes from blog decks and
just stuff

21:00.460 --> 21:06.340
that it's scraped off of the web
there's about 5 to 10 new MP3s
that as well. It's

21:06.340 --> 21:13.500
always very surprising, all
of wacky stuff that just kind of
up. Total serendipity,

21:13.500 --> 21:17.700
if you will. I have no idea
going to show up. A lot of it's
someone's very,

21:17.700 --> 21:26.180
very interesting. So I'll start
to that as well. So the script
I've created,

21:27.000 --> 21:31.080
doesn't work the way it should
and I already lost that source
by

21:31.080 --> 21:36.120
accidentally compiling it in
and not knowing that you lose
source code.

21:36.120 --> 21:42.520
But I'm going to start working
that again in in the also after
1st

21:42.520 --> 21:46.360
so that you know you don't have
really think about oh how am I
to do this

21:46.360 --> 21:48.880
what do I need with the news
how do I get

21:48.880 --> 21:54.040
the mp3s from point A to point B
it should just be something as
as

21:56.160 --> 22:02.400
start this program up and you
to your RSS feeds and it kind of
the rest

22:02.400 --> 22:06.920
it just drops everything on your
and playlists and it even has a

22:06.920 --> 22:13.360
little notification system so
know when something is new has
updated.

22:15.000 --> 22:22.440
So I'm now just passing over the
into the Netherlands from
Thank you for accompanying me on
trip and

22:22.440 --> 22:29.600
Tomorrow, I'll be back with
daily source code. Thanks for
and see you tomorrow. Bye
