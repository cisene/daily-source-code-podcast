00:01.500 --> 00:17.980
Yeah, once again, it's the
code.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.940
Today is the 16th of August,

00:22.940 --> 00:24.460
Hi everybody, I'm Adam Curry.

00:24.460 --> 00:29.700
Welcome from Curry Castle in
Belgium.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.460
And of course, just as I'm about
start,

00:31.460 --> 00:34.220
this looks like everyone's
home.

00:34.220 --> 00:35.500
Okay, my daughter.

00:35.500 --> 00:39.220
She had some kind of insect
on her arm

00:39.220 --> 00:42.220
and she went to the doctor's
and showed me

00:42.220 --> 00:43.700
how it is in just a second.

00:43.700 --> 00:47.940
So I'm back on the radio for the
two weeks

00:50.620 --> 00:54.100
Started this morning, got up at

00:54.100 --> 00:56.980
Yeah, that was quite a shock
about 10 days off.

00:56.980 --> 01:02.140
Although, you know, even on

01:02.140 --> 01:03.740
I couldn't really sleep in at

01:03.740 --> 01:05.740
Once you get into the rhythm,
it.

01:05.740 --> 01:07.180
You're just in the rhythm.

01:07.180 --> 01:09.380
I was getting up at 6.30 every

01:09.380 --> 01:12.660
And actually as of September 1st

01:12.660 --> 01:14.020

01:14.020 --> 01:16.140

01:16.140 --> 01:17.180

01:17.180 --> 01:20.980

to it.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.360

some huge delay. Oh, that's
Mm. Nice. I wonder why all of a

Hmm. Alrighty. I also hear my

protest song there. Just love
What else has

04:51.240 --> 04:57.560
been going on? I've been, oh,
to an excellent audiobook.
by Michael

04:57.560 --> 05:04.160
Criton. It's the unabridged
which means in total it's 14
worth of spoken

05:04.160 --> 05:08.800
words. Speaker's actually pretty
He's doing accents because part
it, at least

05:08.800 --> 05:15.000
the part that I'm at now, is
in France, so he's doing French
So,

05:15.000 --> 05:24.720
no, it's actually quite cool.
book. And I bought it off of
Really convenient.

05:24.720 --> 05:28.480
I'm big audiobook so much. And
I didn't catch much on the iPad,

05:28.500 --> 05:35.100
Potter script the other night.
for Dave's audio blog, I figured
just

05:35.100 --> 05:38.780
listen to a book I'd already
so I'm kind of in the middle of

05:38.780 --> 05:42.700
And I actually did have a great
with Dave Weiner. We talked
our audio

05:42.700 --> 05:49.660
blogs and it seems that we're
doing a radio show together. But

05:49.660 --> 05:53.060
are people listening, I'm
at my server logs and there was
least

05:53.060 --> 06:01.220
well, there was over a hundred
of a second show that I did. And

06:01.220 --> 06:04.860
talking about how much room
is, so much room for improvement

06:04.860 --> 06:08.900
distributing our audio and video
the stuff that we make. You
this is,

06:08.900 --> 06:13.660
we've got all the bits in place
I think a lot of it pertains.
know, a

06:13.660 --> 06:17.860
lot of the blogging stuff we're
will fit perfectly with audio
video. A

06:17.860 --> 06:21.900
lot of it won't really wasn't
that way. And it's just
You

06:21.900 --> 06:25.740
know, all I think all the stuff
there. It's just how do we make
as simple as

06:25.740 --> 06:31.380
possible. And the day that
my wife,

06:30.000 --> 06:36.320
You know, has an iPod that she
slips into the cradle and it
downloads

06:36.320 --> 06:39.520
her favorite music channels from

06:39.520 --> 06:45.800
Or it could be a cooking show or
new show or an interview show or
could be all kinds

06:45.800 --> 06:50.340
of different audio files without
having to do anything else but
click

06:50.340 --> 06:52.440
a box to subscribe to something.

06:52.440 --> 06:56.800
That's when we've achieved
in my book.

06:56.800 --> 07:01.720
Let's see, about seven minutes
this now, there's not a lot
on.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.720
It is a Monday.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.840
I guess everyone's just kind of
back to work now after vacation.

07:05.840 --> 07:09.880
So an opportune day to play a
of the day.

07:09.880 --> 07:13.920
Actually I felt like playing
country in Western.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.600
Don't get a lot of that over

07:16.600 --> 07:21.640
In fact, most people over here
country music and a lot of
in America hate country

07:21.640 --> 07:22.640
music too.

07:22.640 --> 07:31.520
But this is a classic that
loves and it is by Mr. Country
Johnny Cash.

07:31.500 --> 07:36.940
I like to stay out and help us
some songs play the guitar for
greatest guitar players as well
songwriters

07:36.940 --> 07:39.920
Thanks, my business. Make me
a little hip on the guitar. All

07:39.920 --> 07:54.420
Well my daddy left home when I
three and he didn't leave much
and me just this old guitar an
bottle of food

07:56.580 --> 08:02.260
I don't blame him because he
here, but the meanest thing that
ever did was before he left

08:02.260 --> 08:04.360
He wouldn't named me Sue

08:04.360 --> 08:12.500
Well, he must have thought that
was quite a joke and it got a
of laughs from a lot of folks

08:12.500 --> 08:14.500
I had to fight my whole life

08:14.500 --> 08:24.300
Some cow would giggle and I'd
rid and some guy'd laugh tonight
his head. I'll take it life
easy for a boy named Sue

08:24.500 --> 08:32.900
Well, I grew up quick and I grew
seeing my fist got hard my wits
keen

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Roll from town to town to hide
shame

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
But I make me about the moon and

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I search the haunted Thompson

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
And kill that man and give me
awful name

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Well it was Captain Burger in

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
And I'd just hit town and my
was dry

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
I thought I'd stop and held
a groove

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Had an old balloon on a street
mud

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
There at the table, he'll

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Set the thirty mange you talk,
me Sue

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Well I knew that snake was my
sweet dad

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
From a worn out picture that my
had

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
And I knew that scar on his
and his evil eye

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
He was big and bent and pretty
old

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
And I looked at him and my blood
cold

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I said, my name is Sue

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
How do you do?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Now you sit down

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah, but I told him

09:30.000 --> 09:34.440
Well I hit him hard right
the eyes and the eyes.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.500
He went down but some nice

09:36.500 --> 09:39.500
Come up with a knife and cut off
piece of my ear.

09:39.500 --> 09:43.500
Well I busted a chair right
his teeth

09:43.500 --> 09:45.500
and we crashed through the wall
the street

09:45.500 --> 09:48.500
kicking in a gouging and the mud
the blood and the beard.

09:48.500 --> 09:52.500
I told you I bought the Tucker

09:52.500 --> 09:54.500
but I really can't remember

09:54.500 --> 09:58.500
It kicked like a mule and it bit
a crocodile.

09:58.500 --> 10:02.500
I heard him laughing and I heard
cussing.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.500
He went for his gun to pull mine

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500
He said they're looking at me.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
I saw him smile.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.500
He said, son, this world is

10:11.500 --> 10:14.500
And if a man's gonna make it,
gotta be tough.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.500
And I know I wouldn't be there
help you along.

10:17.500 --> 10:21.500
So I give you that name and I
goodbye.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.500
And you'd have to get tough or

10:23.500 --> 10:26.500
And it's that name that helped
make you strong.

10:28.500 --> 10:32.500
Yeah. He said, now you just
one hell of a fight.

10:32.500 --> 10:36.500
And I know you hate me and you
the right to kill me now.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I wouldn't blame you if you do

10:38.000 --> 10:44.040
But you ought to thank me before
die for the gravel and your guts
the spitting eye

10:44.040 --> 10:47.120
But I'm the son of a bitch that
you soon

10:47.120 --> 10:54.820
What could I do I got old chills
and I flew down my gun

10:54.820 --> 11:00.080
Called him upon he called me a
and I come away with a different
of view

11:01.600 --> 11:06.720
And I think about him not then
time I try every time I win

11:06.720 --> 11:14.240
And if I ever have a son, I
I'm gonna name him bill or
anything but

11:14.240 --> 11:24.640
I'm legendary Johnny Cash boy
suit

11:24.640 --> 11:27.600
On the daily source code

11:28.320 --> 11:31.320
Just want to wind it up with a
of things whoops

11:31.320 --> 11:37.520
One is the Olympics now we've
noticed that no one has blocked

11:37.500 --> 11:40.660
logging from the Olympic Games.

11:40.660 --> 11:45.300
And I think I know why because
Olympic Games has nothing to do
what you think

11:45.300 --> 11:46.820
the Olympic Games are.

11:46.820 --> 11:53.440
The prices are too expensive for
individual events, at least for
people, just to

11:53.440 --> 11:56.260
spend a few bucks and go to your

11:56.260 --> 12:01.180
It's all invited officials and

and the

12:01.180 --> 12:04.500
National Sport Federation and
National Olympic Committees.

12:04.500 --> 12:11.740
And it's all cronies and it's
big advertising you have to make
television events is

12:11.740 --> 12:14.100
what it is.

12:14.100 --> 12:18.980
And you can even see how the
are cutting the shots so you
see, hey baby,

12:18.980 --> 12:20.580
how are you?

12:20.580 --> 12:21.580

That bug had some kind of

12:37.540 --> 12:38.540
Shit.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.880
It's completely red associated

13:08.800 --> 13:28.600
stung in. The stinger. Well, it
very official. Looks like you're
wounded. Okay, I'm gonna wrap
up.

13:28.600 --> 13:40.480
One last thing. Just a quick

2004. And it will be held in...
