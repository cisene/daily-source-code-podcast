WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:11.500
It's the source code.

00:11.500 --> 00:14.500
Today is Sunday August 22nd

00:14.500 --> 00:24.500
I'm at Curry another source code
Belgium from Curry Castle where
looks like, oh,

00:24.500 --> 00:29.420
with any luck we maybe saw it in
place pretty soon.

00:29.420 --> 00:34.420
Belgium came back on Friday to
for the second time when it
back Monday morning

00:34.420 --> 00:39.420
tomorrow at 11 a.m. so that's
encouraging.

00:39.420 --> 00:42.420
For today I just want to talk
a couple things.

00:42.420 --> 00:44.420
Hold on a second, Mike.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.420
My preferred is...

00:46.420 --> 00:47.420
Am I even...

00:47.420 --> 00:48.420
Nah, hey.

00:48.420 --> 00:51.420
Let me see if I can switch this
the fly.

00:51.420 --> 00:53.420
You

00:55.500 --> 01:01.980
So my internal mic on my laptop
be a great attribute to Apple if
can do this on the

01:01.980 --> 01:02.980
fly.

01:02.980 --> 01:03.980
Let's see.

01:03.980 --> 01:04.980
One, two.

01:04.980 --> 01:05.980
Yeah.

01:05.980 --> 01:06.980
It worked.

01:06.980 --> 01:07.980
Okay.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.280
Well, continuing to record.

01:09.280 --> 01:12.900
That sounds a hell of a lot

01:12.900 --> 01:17.360
Lots of people are asking me
the source code, where the name
from source code

01:17.360 --> 01:21.500
and they obviously didn't catch
very first episode.

01:21.500 --> 01:25.460
source code is pretty much what
would sound to be.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.100
It's what's behind the program.

01:28.100 --> 01:31.340
If you look at my web log is
here's all the thoughts that are
from my

01:31.340 --> 01:36.500
brain that I actually get onto
web, get published.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.940
The thoughts behind that is the
code.

01:38.940 --> 01:42.300
And so every day I just talk
whatever's going on and what I'm
about and what's

01:42.300 --> 01:43.660
happening.

01:43.660 --> 01:49.340
And most of what I've talked
is probably linked to on that
or the previous day's

01:49.340 --> 01:50.500
page.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.500
So this is just the brain dump.

01:51.500 --> 01:56.900
It's usually about 10 to 15
long and I try to do it every
day.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.380
Doug Kay from IT Conversations
you can find at
left a note on

02:02.380 --> 02:08.640
my web log. He wanted to know if
ipotter software, if that script
going to support

02:08.640 --> 02:18.560
AAC files which is Apple's
and DRM technology for audio
And

02:18.560 --> 02:26.000
yeah, the answer is of course it
And the best part is that AAC
indeed have

02:26.000 --> 02:32.440
a bookmark. So if you go to a
track on your ipotter and iTunes
your MPD player

02:32.440 --> 02:38.320
in general, when you go back to
it should pick up where you left
But yeah, you know,

02:38.320 --> 02:45.200
there's a lot to do. How about
for Adam files and do Adam files
have

02:45.200 --> 02:50.400
enclosures? I'm sure that they
But that's, you know, that's
to be a whole nother

02:50.400 --> 02:56.240
trick to figure out how to
that. And quite frankly, I'm
that someone picks

02:56.240 --> 02:58.520
up and starts doing about

02:58.500 --> 03:05.500
better iPod or in a cross
platform or scripting language
takes over. But

03:05.500 --> 03:12.760
until then, I'll continue
Doug K. Vit conversations. One
the shows that's

03:12.760 --> 03:21.620
on there is Gilmore Gang. And I
listening to last Friday's
This is hosted by

03:21.620 --> 03:29.940
Steve Gilmore. He writes for,
a contributing editor for ZDNet
they have a set number

03:29.940 --> 03:40.680
of panelists and besides regular
swirls, Dave Sifri of Technorati
also on the panel

03:40.680 --> 03:50.820
I guess as a member of the
Gang. And the guest was Tuntec,
from Technorati.

03:50.820 --> 03:57.100
Now, you know, I was listening
the show or I was thinking
I have Technorati

03:57.100 --> 03:59.980
links on my web log but I get as
as I can tell I have.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.960
I guess zero benefit out of it.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.760
There's never a paying to it.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.960
There's never an updated
link,

04:05.960 --> 04:07.700
or very, very rarely.

04:07.700 --> 04:11.600
So I'm not quite sure what it

04:11.600 --> 04:13.080
I understand what they're
about,

04:13.080 --> 04:16.560
but so I'm just kind of
away, surfing a bit.

04:16.560 --> 04:20.080
And then I heard Steve Gilmore
something interesting.

04:20.080 --> 04:23.360
And he started talking about
he called

04:23.360 --> 04:25.920
the iPod platform, like whoa,
on.

04:25.920 --> 04:29.960
That sounds like something that
been talking about.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.680
The iPod platform.

04:31.680 --> 04:36.000
iPod as a platform, a way to
information,

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
not just music or MP3s, but it
be a lot more.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.320
Like the Gilmore gang, for

04:41.320 --> 04:43.240
and like this show, Source Code.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.360
So of course now I feel more
ever,

04:46.360 --> 04:48.120
like we're on to something here.

04:48.120 --> 04:52.120
And I wanna just play a little
of that part

04:52.120 --> 04:55.400
of Steve Gilmore talking about

04:55.400 --> 04:58.000
what he calls the iPod platform.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.040
And it's about three minutes.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.500
just have a listen person.

05:03.500 --> 05:09.500
That TANTech mentioned was the
kinds of data types.

05:09.500 --> 05:19.500
Video, audio, this program, for
is achieving a very, very
audience

05:19.500 --> 05:25.500
in the download market, in the
platform, as I've called it.

05:25.500 --> 05:33.500
As new programs come online,
Weiner does his morning coffee

05:33.500 --> 05:38.500
Adam Curry has got a terrific
program called Source Code, I

05:38.500 --> 05:46.500
And, Hallie Sude, I believe, has
program that she started on IT

05:46.500 --> 05:49.500
Doug can fill us in on that.

05:49.500 --> 05:54.500
So, you know, as this kind of
starts to proliferate, it seems
we're going to have

05:54.500 --> 06:02.500
a similar problem, which is
the time to consume the best of
information.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
as it populates the network.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
So, does attention have a role
this space?

06:13.500 --> 06:14.940
I think this is not a fact.

06:14.940 --> 06:22.860
I think it's important to
that sometimes it's better to
to solve a simple problem

06:22.860 --> 06:28.140
and try to do a really good job
it and get lots of feedback and
and then

06:28.140 --> 06:33.260
try to grow certainly the scope
what you're working on if it
sense, if it can make

06:33.260 --> 06:38.980
sense to include other data
other media types.

06:38.980 --> 06:41.740
What we are involved in sort of
about, you know, up to this
has been

06:41.740 --> 06:46.860
sort of onslaught of text that
been subject to because of the
and that

06:46.860 --> 06:50.660
we feel an almost urgency to all
up with.

06:50.660 --> 06:55.460
We kind of feel left out if we
know exactly what everyone's
about everything.

06:55.460 --> 06:59.660
And that's the first approach is
try to at least triage that to
manageable.

06:59.660 --> 07:01.140
But you're absolutely right,

07:01.140 --> 07:05.300
It's not like the flood is over
we've solved that problem.

07:05.300 --> 07:09.580
New media types are showing up
and more just like blogs that
it easy to publish

07:09.580 --> 07:11.780
text on the web.

07:11.780 --> 07:14.940
The audio blogs and other tools
developing.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
to publish other media types,
photos, etc.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
and share them.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
And then the question is, well,
do I pay attention to what's
interesting there?

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
And so absolutely, I think that
trying to keep multiple media

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
or media type independence in
from the beginning.

07:34.000 --> 07:41.000
I mean, to me, this is a very
characteristic to the T-Vo

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
I used that as a Kleenex type
name rather than specific

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
It's T-Vo for the web.

07:49.000 --> 07:57.000
And as the web and multiple
crisscross and sort of converge,

07:57.000 --> 08:08.000
we're seeing companies like SBC
the paper yesterday.

08:08.000 --> 08:16.000
SBC and just network are moving
movies on demand.

08:16.500 --> 08:23.700
They're keeping it fairly scoped
the traditional content
the movie studios and the

08:23.700 --> 08:24.700
record companies.

08:24.700 --> 08:32.980
But once the door is opened, I
that we'll see a lot of direct
web or direct from

08:32.980 --> 08:35.820
web content starting to emerge.

08:35.820 --> 08:43.540
And the characteristics of
who are consuming that media, if
are recorded

08:43.540 --> 08:52.580
and transmitted to the attention
using attention.xml, that
allows for

08:52.580 --> 09:03.180
the implicit metadata of how
consume this information to be
returned to the

09:03.180 --> 09:05.500
group of people that are
in.

09:05.500 --> 09:10.780
You know, maybe there are 100
who have already listened to the
open source or

09:10.780 --> 09:13.140
source code broadcast.

09:13.140 --> 09:17.140
and say that it's the best one

09:18.000 --> 09:25.480
the way that they've listened to
in terms of what they've done
other input systems

09:25.480 --> 09:29.720
on the computer during that
of time. In other words, nothing
be an indication

09:29.720 --> 09:35.480
that this is a useful program
they've listened to from
to end without

09:35.480 --> 09:43.200
stopping or doing much else
perhaps clicking on the website,
website for

09:43.200 --> 09:44.200
more information.

09:44.200 --> 09:50.040
Okay, so a couple extra
things there that Steve was
I guess they're

09:50.040 --> 09:54.840
talking about some attention,
present server or something in
middle. That's

09:54.840 --> 09:58.760
probably what Technorati is
to be is where, oh, there's a
bunch of stuff

09:58.760 --> 10:03.600
that you should be looking at.
here to go check it out. But it
good.

10:03.600 --> 10:08.160
I don't know if it's really
or, you know, but it actually
a little bit

10:08.160 --> 10:14.680
ahead of where we're at right
where we still have to figure
how to get two different

10:14.680 --> 10:18.520
types of feeds, RSS and Adam to
together. You know, we're still
on the aggregator

10:19.500 --> 10:25.900
And then what Steve was talking
TBO for the web, I totally agree
that.

10:25.900 --> 10:31.220
That's where aggregators are
to get a lot smarter and
more specific doing

10:31.220 --> 10:38.060
certain tasks and hopefully
also have the big mother of all
that'll

10:38.060 --> 10:42.740
do everything for you when you
it as you like it and spit it
in multiple play

10:42.740 --> 10:43.740
out systems.

10:43.740 --> 10:45.740
Um

10:46.500 --> 10:53.460
what the end of the day was
about how people would be
to a program

10:53.460 --> 10:57.580
for instance like source code
what you're doing while
to it. I'm interested

10:57.580 --> 11:02.500
if you want to leave a comment
do. Do you listen to the whole
from beginning

11:02.500 --> 11:07.020
to end? Do you do anything else?
you reading, surfing, checking
Are you walking?

11:07.020 --> 11:11.620
Are you in the car? I'd love to
where you listen to the program.

11:11.620 --> 11:21.300
And of course something I'd love
enhance this show is the ability
somehow embed

11:21.300 --> 11:28.980
links. I'm not quite sure how
would work. It may not. Right
as D point out you've

11:28.980 --> 11:32.300
listened to the the audio blog
and if you want more information
go do my web

11:32.300 --> 11:42.900
blog. And let's see I want to
about oh Patricia, she of course
wonders what

11:42.900 --> 11:47.260
I'm doing here in the bar with
door closed and I told her about
code and she listened

11:48.000 --> 11:51.440
She always thinks quite
and said,

11:51.440 --> 11:55.120
well, so how do you plan to make
on this?

11:55.120 --> 11:58.040
Or I said, no, no, that's not
point.

11:58.040 --> 11:59.680
And though I'm gonna be able to
her

11:59.680 --> 12:03.600
how I see that working and why
you have to charge

12:03.600 --> 12:07.560
for something just because I get
in other media

12:07.560 --> 12:10.320
to use my voice in exactly the
way,

12:10.320 --> 12:13.000
that's kind of inexplicable.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.680
But one thing you could do, of
is,

12:15.680 --> 12:18.000
well, if we have enough of the
people listening,

12:18.000 --> 12:19.480
could always embed commercials.

12:19.480 --> 12:23.800
And, gee, we could do all kinds
interesting commercials.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.320
Here's one that I pulled out of
iTunes

12:26.320 --> 12:29.480
that reminds you just how far

Winston takes good, like a

Um...

13:05.500 --> 13:09.500
One more plea for software to do
type of program with.

13:09.500 --> 13:14.500
Um, I've been given so many
and I even tried megasag

13:14.500 --> 13:16.500
And no one really just has it.

13:16.500 --> 13:21.500
I posted about this before, I
the interface and really what
be absolutely perfect is it.

13:21.500 --> 13:26.500
If I could just record whatever
out of the speakers, including a
signal.

13:26.500 --> 13:32.500
Um, because then I could just be
quick time movies or MPEGs or
and whatever player I wanted.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.500
I could have playlists and a
that does playlists.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.500
Well, it seems like it can be

13:36.500 --> 13:38.500
It has, it must be possible.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.500
You can just get to the core
driver or something like that.

13:41.500 --> 13:46.500
Um, in order to, um, add to
all of the audio.

13:46.500 --> 13:50.500
And, um, audio hijack, although
can record multiple...

13:51.000 --> 13:56.940
multiple applications and a mic
at the same time it writes them
all

13:56.940 --> 14:02.580
different files so it's just not
know I really need a DJ mixing
that

14:02.580 --> 14:11.400
will write a mix directly to mp3
and and enables you to set up a
of

14:11.400 --> 14:15.480
hotkeys to trigger off preset
you should be able to drag stuff
a

14:15.480 --> 14:20.640
playlist on the fly if you want
you're talking and and the mic
has to

14:20.640 --> 14:25.080
be able to mix it and some
of the mic channel would be nice
well

14:25.080 --> 14:32.360
okay song of the day beautiful
here in Belgium it's nice and
and I

14:32.360 --> 14:37.480
figured we got to play something
everybody can sing along to

14:37.760 --> 14:52.800
this is one of those songs the

And I'm home with my fast-dabbed
And I'm out here in my ear.

16:48.500 --> 17:01.000
I'll go home with you tonight
we'll have each other tight And
be parking on past the middle of
year.

17:01.000 --> 17:13.000
I'll never dance without my love
my soul stands there.

17:13.000 --> 17:19.000
It was in the house of the world
there.

17:19.000 --> 17:26.000
It was in the house of the world
there.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
I thought I was standing there
Beatles on source code for

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
And I just wanted to wind up
report with some work I did last

17:37.500 --> 17:43.500
on this pinnacle show server
I blogged about and I've spoken
earlier in source code reports.

17:43.500 --> 17:52.500
Now, what this turn... well,
it is, it's kind of a DVD-like
That's the slimline thing.

17:52.500 --> 17:58.500
You put on top of DVD player and
basically plug a Wi-Fi card in
back which comes which is
with.

17:58.500 --> 18:02.500
And then you hook it up to your
you have hooked it up to our big
view screen.

18:02.500 --> 18:10.500
And then you start a server with
special software that only runs
Windows.

18:10.500 --> 18:17.500
And then you can scan your
get all kinds of media, you set
a watch folder, drop stuff in,
added to the library.

18:17.500 --> 18:29.500
And what you do is you log into
system on your television with
remote and it gives you an
of your library and it plays
in order for you and it's
stuff.

18:29.500 --> 18:38.500
And I thought this was some
sophisticated stuff until Yerun
on the comments on my web blog
me to an open source.

18:39.000 --> 18:48.000
a source version of a server and
turns out that this box is
no more than just a web browser
media players, which is a pretty
idea.

18:48.000 --> 18:56.000
They really should promote that
so more people would be making
management systems and servers
for this.

18:56.000 --> 19:05.000
They seem to be using all open
so that's fine, maybe a couple
extra bits there to get the new
light working on the front if
new is added.

19:05.000 --> 19:15.000
In fact, I built a little
on my powerbook and connected to
from the system and linked to an
file and it played.

19:15.000 --> 19:25.000
Then I started digging a little
into the windows, not to the
really into the directory and it
out that's a web server running
PHP scripts.

19:25.000 --> 19:41.000
So, interesting. And if anyone
any ideas out there for a media
box that I might be able to
to, if you connect to it with a
browser,

19:40.500 --> 19:44.620
essentially you can do it with
thing. You know let me know
it. And

19:44.620 --> 19:50.580
finally I'm looking for more RSS
with audio enclosures. You know
I

19:50.580 --> 19:55.860
work on the next beta release of
I need more content coming in
to be

19:55.860 --> 20:00.700
able to test in a real-world
You know my own stuff comes back
me.

20:00.700 --> 20:06.180
Dave's on the road right now
not updating very frequently.
some

20:06.180 --> 20:10.540
other audio blogs that have no
feed or most of them though.
maybe one of

20:10.540 --> 20:14.500
the big services has an
feed that I'm not aware of yet.
please let

20:14.500 --> 20:23.740
me know. It's Adam at Curry.com
my web log is at live

20:23.740 --> 20:28.700
I'd love to hear from you and
for listening if you caught this

20:28.700 --> 20:33.420
iPodter or through another news
Thank you very much for

tomorrow.

20:42.000 --> 21:03.380
