description: '  <p><strong>#726 Daily Source Code for Wednesday February 20th 2008</strong></p><p>The ''Batteries Not Included'' episode of the DSC is once again one for the history books. I feel that the ''live'' aspect is working well. Almost real-time reports of the missle<a href="http://www6.comcast.net/news/articles/general/2008/02/14/NEWS-USA-SATELLITE-MISSILE-DC/">blowing</a>the sattelite out of space as well as the meteor strike in Washington state. Some great calls about the state of the nations Uk and USA (patriotic stuff here) and an invite to get thrown in jail for a night on ''the rock''. Add to that some kick ass tunes and Miss Something from brooklyn, who got stood up on a booty call.....  </p><p>Music in this episode:</p><p><a href="http://www.mashuptown.com/2008/02/cant-stop-calli.html">Party Ben</a> - Callin'' On SundayHereâ€™s the DSC Demographics<a href="http://tinyurl.com/356kct">survey link</a></p><p>For lowest prices on domain names, check out the<a href="http://curry.podshow.com/?page_id=845">DSC
