description: ' <strong>#733 Daily Source Code for Friday March 14th 2008</strong><br><br>If I am only able to bring you one show in a particularly busy week, it darn well better be a Fubar Friday an I think I delivered today. 2 main topics to discuss: Why the hell haven''t I been doing shows this week, what''s going on? The answer comes in two parts... One is my road trip and some interesting mainstream media action, the other and most important is the focused strategy and direction PodShow has embarked on. I go into deep detail on our business model, where the money comes from and how you can get your hands on that stream of revenue as an independent producer of audio and video properties. Please don''t get me wrong though, the show is like a freight train runnin'' at breakneck speed, mainly thanks to the music, Sir Jersey Todd and the HitTest, all carefully selected for your listening pleasure. <br><br><strong>Music in this episode:</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00137O79O?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=adamcurrysweb-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B00137O79O">Bruce
