description: While on vacation in Sorrento Italy, I was inspired by two audio files my download script had 'plopped' onto my iPod. One was an edition of IT Conversations from  OSCON, where <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail169.html">Robert Lefkowitz</a> discussed the meaning of source code. The other 'program' was Dave Winer's <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/08/12#When:1:50:22PM">morning coffee notes</a> about the debates between bloggers and journalists.<br><br>Today marks the first episode of the Daily Source Code, available through it's own rss feed as an enclosure.
