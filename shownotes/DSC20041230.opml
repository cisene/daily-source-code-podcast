        <outline text="Regarding the MP3 warble problem:  I don't know how much of this you know or don't know (I'm sure a lot of it's old news to you, but someone else here might be able to use this info), so I'll just run down everything I know. I'm not a pro, but this is what I know from what I picked up.  --  You're getting all the warble because you changed the SAMPLE rate of the audio, but not the BITrate of the compression. That means you have more raw, uncompressed audio going in, hence it needs to be compressed more aggressively.  The SAMPLE rate measures the rate of the individual voltage readings that make up a waveform. For example, CD quality audio is 44100Hz, or 44100 samples per second.  The practical sound application of sample rate is that the highest frequency you can represent digitally is the sample rate divided by 2. (This highest frequency would be a simple square wave: one sample for the high point, one sample for the low point.) Although the human ear cuts off at around 11-12kHz, some people can tell a difference in tone and quality between a 22050 (highest freq: 11025Hz) and a 44100 (highest freq: 22050Hz) sound file.  The practical data application of sample rate is that, basically, samples are data. A uncompressed file with a higher sample rate has more data than one with a lower sample rate. This comes into play in your situation when you try to compress them down.  The BITRATE is a bit different. Fundamentally, the bit rate has nothing to do with the &quot;sound&quot; that's being produced. It's simply a measure of &quot;How much data does one second of sound take up?&quot;.  Compression attempts to shrink the size (number of bits) per second of audio, making the uncompressed audio, (at about 705.6kbps for CD-quality audio) into a file at 64kbps or 128kbps MP3s that you're used to.  When you tell the MP3 compressor you want a 64kbps file, you're telling it, &quot;Compress this raw audio, whatever it is, enough that one second will take up 64000 bits.&quot; Basically, you're setting the size of the &quot;box&quot;, and the MP3 compressor stuffs your audio down small enough to fit.  When you had the downsampling to 21000Hz sample rate, there were fewer samples per second, and therefore less raw audio data that the compressor had to fit in that 64kb &quot;box&quot;. When you turned that off, however, it was trying to cram almost twice as much raw data (the 44100Hz-rate original file) into the same-size 64kbps &quot;box&quot;. The only way to achieve that was to apply more squeeze to it. Since MP3 is lossy compression, more compression means more loss, and you get the signature MP3 warble.  My advice would be to set the the process up to make 22050Hz files, which is a more common sample rate, and should (hopefully) work on people's portables. You really don't need that sound quality up in the 11050-22050Hz frequencies for something as talk-based as what you're doing. Alternatively, you could look into making VBR (Variable BitRate) MP3 files, which analyze each frame of audio and pick the best bitrate for good-sounding compression."/>

A colossal 20-foot tidal wave strikes the shores of the Ganges Delta on November 13, 1970, wreaking lethal damage on the people of East Pakistan. A 120-mile per hour cyclone spurred the tidal wave that washed over 100 islands near the coast. The island of Bolla took the brunt of the storm with an estimated 100,000 dead. An estimated total of 150,000 dead makes this the century's largest disaster by water. The Ganges Delta had suffered many furious storms, but this is the worst natural disaster in the history of the region. Damage would however been even greater had not an extensive system of dikes been established in the years before, to reduce the flooding that has long plagued the shores of East Pakistan. "/>
