On Osysmyso, Intro Inspection (http://bitter.cream.org/audio/mp3/osymyso/osymysointroinspection.mp3) is great (the experiment was to find if it was possible to take 8 beats from 88 pop songs and make a mix that is 8 minutes and 8 seconds long from the loops and the result is a mix of 55 songs in almost 10 minutes) , but also for Eastenders fans theres Pat n Peg http://bitter.cream.org/audio/mp3/osymyso/osymysopatnpeg.mp3"/>

        <outline text=""/>
        <outline text="Dear Adam,"/>
        <outline text="Your comments on your December 28th Daily Source Code concerning the parachutes was right on."/>
        <outline text="I am a crew chief on a UH-60 (Black Hawk) MEDEVAC helicopter.  I am currently winding down my second tour in Iraq, my third to the Middle East, and I have never even considered a parachute as an option.  (Even if a parachute was possible in our bird it would be foolish.)"/>
        <outline text="Granted there is a huge difference in fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft when it comes to emergency procedures, namely, a fixed-wing aircraft has glide characteristics by it's very design without engine power whereas a rotary-wing bird has the glide characteristics of a rock.  Autorotation is our parachute."/>
        <outline text="I've had passengers ask me about &quot;our parachutes.&quot;  I always laugh at this because it's totally amusing.  We fly so low and, 95% of the time at speeds of 160 knots or more, that if something was to go wrong, even if there was a parachute that would deploy with any acceptable usefulness 50 feet off the ground it would be completely entangled in a potentially mangled rotor system anyhow.  In an emergency the only thing we have time to do is lock our harness reels and pray the pilots up front are doing the right thing."/>
        <outline text="I am also nearly finished with my FAA private pilot certification and the thought of a parachute on my bird seems fairly ridiculous.  I can just see someone having an engine malfunction, freaking out, ignoring the emergency procedures section of their checklist, and popping this chute at 2,000 feet over a populated area.  Not only will they be seriously injured, or killed, but so will dozens, maybe even hundreds, of innocents below both from the impact and the ensuing fire."/>
        <outline text="You also mentioned that the seats were rated to absorb 30Gs of impact.  That's all well and good but a human body can not handle an impact of more than around 11 Gs.  So unless those seats are magically distributing 20+ Gs of force, the passengers/crew of said bird are going to be seriously injured, perhaps even more so than if they had attempted an emergency landing."/>
        <outline text="I am by no means a mathematical genius and don't know with what kind of force a parachuting aircraft will impact but on the whole this parachute idea sounds like a very bad one."/>
        <outline text="For $16,000 a pilot could get a ton more training, both in the aircraft and out, from qualified instructors who would instill in them a sense of confidence and level-headedness that could prevent them from ever getting into a situation requiring such a silly device.  Take for example the US Air Force crew that landed the EP-3 in China several years ago.  Because their bird was so messed up they did aerobatic maneuvers that it was NEVER designed to do.  But because of their superb training, attention to detail and keeping their wits about them they were able to safely land a totally unflyable aircraft."/>
        <outline text="That money could be better spent elsewhere."/>
        <outline text="Respectfully,"/>
