      <outline text="Hopefully I will go down in podcasting history as the first person to document a podcasted show in my Arbitron radio diary. I had really hoped that I would be able to list the DSC in the diary but couldn't get around the fact that one of the pieces of data they require for each entry is whether the show is on AM or FM. I was afraid that including the DSC might invalidate the diary."/>
      <outline text=""/>
      <outline text="I wound up listing my other favorite podcast done by Leo Laporte on KFI 640 AM in Los Angeles. I also made a note in the comments section of the diary explaining how podcasting makes it possible for me to listen to a radio station in Los Angeles while living in Louisville, KY. I finished by  including a quote that I think is suitable a bumper sticker (do they have bumper stickers in Europe?). &quot;Podcasting expands radio's reach.&quot;"/>

          <outline text="Dear Adam,"/>
          <outline text=""/>
          <outline text="?? Hello from snowy Rhode Island.? I was listening to your podcast today and was rather intrigued to hear your Edward R. Murrow clip posted from another listener.? I dont know if you know about his history at CBS or the structure of radio at that time, (I assume that as a professional in radio you probably already do) but before Murrow came to CBS, radio was very much scripted and edited down with little or no live brodcasts at all.? Its all very interesting to see how he began to pioneer the &quot;soundseeing&quot; that you yourself are now taking an interest in.? Bob Edwards, the long? time NPR voice on Morning Edition actually wrote a book on Murrow entitled &quot;Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism&quot; that was an excellent read and also quoted the very broadcast that you podcasted today.? Anyhow, just thought I'd drop you a line on that one.? Oh, and it was Jamie Fox, not Jamie Farr; but you probably got about 50 other corrections on that one.? Keep up the great work, you have pretty much become my afternoon commute."/>

          <outline text=""/>
          <outline text="ps.? In regards to your search for GPS interface, you may want to research the garmin ique 500 (not sure on that model #), which is a gps/palm device that has some quirky little options on it.? Also, have you heard of the cell phone project in NYC that tags numbers on locations, and when you call them, you are given a little audio snippet?? I was hearing a buzz on this sometime back but ran out of interest until you popped that little idea into my head.? The GPS sync shouldn't be too out of reach though....my handheld GPS allows me to connect text notes to locations."/>
