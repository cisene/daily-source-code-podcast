Lefsetz writes a very, very influential newsletter to all the top RIAA industry types. My CEO, Paul Zullo turned me onto him. As I've been evangizling RSS &amp; Podcasting to him, he had the opportunity to go to his (Lefsetz) annual confab in Aspen this past December. When one of the heads of a major label  got up to speak, he asked, &quot;Who in here has heard of RSS &amp; Podcasting?&quot; My boss, and our SVP of Marketing were the only 2 to raise their hands out of a total of 130."/>
