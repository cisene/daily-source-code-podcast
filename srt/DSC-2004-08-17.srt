00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,980
Thanks for watching!

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Bye.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Bye.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Mmm.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,900
♪♪♪♪

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Adam Curry. Got a short source code for you today. Of course it's hectic here as always.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,300
A church has a meeting she went to, so I got to take care of dinner. The animals haven't

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,700
been fed yet. And when I say animals, I mean animals, right? We've got goats and chickens

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:51,420
and swans and ducks and horses. Yeah, menagerie. And my mic is still really crappy. My question,

10
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,860
it's somehow the software is not able to handle something with this microphone because

11
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,740
it's only really the mic that craps out. The rest works fine. And the mic works fine on

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,060
other applications. So what can I say? Still looking for a great interface on something

13
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,180
to record my mp3s to if anyone has any ideas. Really could use it. Someone's got to make

14
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,580
it. Let's see what's going on. Today I met with the head honchos at the radio station.

15
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,220
As you know, I'm stopping for the first of September with the morning show. They really

16
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,940
want me to keep me involved with the station. And we came up with a plan with like a talk show.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,960
format that also involves me and my guests flying into helicopter and continuing our

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,200
conversation, which I'm excited about because that's something you could do for radio, you

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,720
could do with television. And of course, I'll be able to blog a lot of that as I go along.

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,840
So I'll keep you updated as that moves. We're going to sleep on the idea for a couple of

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:53,320
days. Kind of freaky news about Blair Witch Project, about the cinematographer. Of course,

22
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,720
now I forgot to jot down his name. Hold on a second. He was the cinematographer of Blair

23
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,040
Witch Project, was filming for a new movie, doing aerial shots from an, I think it was

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,240
a single-engine airplane. And the plane went down. Four people on board, three, including

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,920
the pilot got out, but the guy didn't. And he went down 70 feet, divers, they recovered

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,600
him. He just never got out of the plane. I'll get you his name in a second. I linked to

27
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,480
it on my web log, which forces slow to load as I'm using this Studio 365 live.

28
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,380
application to record and simultaneously pushing out all these bits onto the internet that

29
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:40,820
no one's going to listen to. Got a great new show from IT conversations on my iPod through the

30
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:53,940
iPod or script. Two people I know, one I know better, Halley Comet. Halley Su. Known from Halley's

31
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:01,940
comment.com. I've met her at BloggerCon, the first BloggerCon and Joey Ito. And Halley apparently

32
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,940
is doing a series of shows where she's interviewing people and Joey is the first interview subject.

33
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,780
Joey I met very briefly at BloggerCon. And the format of the show is nice. It's kind of like

34
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,700
a trip down memory lane, which is cool because I recognize a lot of things that the Joey

35
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,180
witnessed and went through, etc. in the early days, really pre-internet, well pre-web certainly.

36
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,140
And I'd love to hear more. I'd love to hear more people talk about

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,160
the history. There's a couple people I think that have some great stories. I think it's

38
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,320
interesting and it's fun to listen to. Damn, this microphone is really crapping out. This

39
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:50,320
is not very good. Neil Fredricks, that's his name. 35 years old. Single engine Cessna.

40
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:57,720
So as I was listening to this show, and I'll talk more about the iPod or in a second,

41
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Of course.

42
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Chrissy!

43
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,560
Shut up!

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Ah, hold on.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,800
Dog.

46
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Lumber dearly, but she's a Maltese. I'm supposed to live until about 12. She's 15 and she's deaf and she's blind

47
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,040
So actually me yelling at her hat makes no sense. Come here. Come on babe.

48
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,480
She can, yeah, she can recognize shape. Hello, baby. Hello, come here. Come here. Come here. It's okay. Yeah

49
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Shit

50
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,280
Oh, go baby. Oh, oh you miss your mommy. See Patricia's off to work. It's kind of hectic today

51
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:45,000
She went to a meeting in Rotterdam about 45 minutes drive each way and so I'm

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,800
Taking care of the

53
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:55,560
Right and we all have to feed be fed. We all need to see we got the ducks the ponies the swans the chickens the goats all of them need food

54
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,520
Okay, let's see now. Hopefully that recorded as I walked away

55
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,520
I'll only know after I listen back to the recording.

56
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,500
one. So back to Halley in doing Joe Ito. In this particular interview, there was a piece

57
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,500
where he tells a story that he told me when I met him at Blodecon and for the 10 minutes

58
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
we spoke, he told me this story. And there's a little more to it than he mentions in the

59
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,860
interview, but I just want you to listen to it. So once again from IT Conversations, I've

60
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:30,060
linked to it on my blog. It's at itconversations.com. It's Joe Ito being interviewed by Halley

61
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:37,060
Su. The internet was eventually going to completely change the way that the media business worked.

62
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:44,060
Right. And that's when I shifted years away. So in the early 90s I moved a little bit from

63
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,180
just traditional media and music to computer graphics and virtual reality. And I was working

64
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,700
with my brother-in-law Scott Fisher then. But when I saw this Mac PPP and I saw packets

65
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,820
which networks are actually really working on a Macintosh, I decided that this is a client

66
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:04,620
to really shift and that I would have a lot more freedom in the internet because I had

67
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,020
felt so much better.

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,720
What do you call it?

69
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,760
Lack of freedom in physical media.

70
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
They're constrained.

71
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,120
And I started preaching this conversion thing sort of in the early 90s.

72
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,160
I was showing the Chairman of NHK, the Adam Curry's page where he had these videos and

73
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
stuff like that.

74
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,560
And this is sort of back when we, I think it was when we were using Go for an FTP and.

75
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Okay.

76
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:35,400
So the video Joey is referring to is actually me in the circus of the stars on ABC television,

77
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,980
during the death defying rocket car of death, where I was up like 60 feet in the air in

78
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,520
a roller coaster car.

79
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,880
I roll down the track ends at the bottom, which launches me through an angry wall of fire.

80
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,440
And then I finally land on a bunch of mattresses and there's Hulk Hogan to welcome.

81
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,120
It was very bizarre.

82
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:02,440
And it was a clip that we cut to Rocket Man by Elton John for I think that was something

83
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,720
we broadcast on MTV.

84
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,820
I made a quick time out of it.

85
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,540
And I've got to tell you, I've lost the tape.

86
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,700
the original tape of that stunt and I really really really loved that video. I told Chris

87
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:20,940
and I told you it's impossible. Hold on. I told Joe you do this and he promised that he would send me

88
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,380
that he would send me a link or somewhere that I could get a hold of that video of that quick time

89
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,380
that original quick time because he says he still has it.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,600
So, Joey, if you are listening, if you heard this, still waiting for the video, but quick

91
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,760
iPod or update.

92
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,260
So I've released beta 03, which now you don't have to do anything, no configuration.

93
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:51,040
It has four feeds currently in there, including IT conversations as default.

94
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,720
You can edit that script if you want.

95
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,700
Just by opening it up in the script editor, which you find in your Apple skip folder,

96
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:06,080
in your applications folder on Mac OS X, you can add URLs to that.

97
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,520
But you don't have to do anything else just to fire it up and it'll run and create an

98
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,680
iPod or folder on your desktop.

99
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,080
That's why all your content is put in.

100
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:21,280
It creates a playlist for each new channel in iTunes and puts all the new shows or content

101
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,080
or whatever it is in there.

102
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,280
And then if you stick your iPod in your dock, press though, it's automatically updated

103
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
with everything new for you in the morning.

104
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Beautiful thing.

105
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
In fact, it makes me wanna sing.

106
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
To sing a lot.

107
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
It's good hokey.

108
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Play something, uh...

109
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
You know, kind of a habit.

110
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,500
I don't know, uh, this is from, uh, I think it's 1963.

111
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Foundation.

112
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,500
What do you think of me? Bye!

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You will never see you

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But I can't even die

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You know what I'm gonna say

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Tell me I'm gonna die

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000

Once again, I apologize about the quality of the microphone. I'm gonna work on that because this is beyond

153
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
unacceptable. So gotta fix that. So anyway, have yourself a great day or evening depending on where you

Are. Roll credits and great show everybody. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye.
