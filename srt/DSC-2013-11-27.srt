which actually is also part of the inspiration for doing the show.

232
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,440
So we were talking about, well, Bitcoin.

233
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,040
And even though I do not recognize it as a currency and I have my doubts,

234
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,840
I made a deal with a lot of the producers of their show.

235
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,240
I said, listen, why not just do a daily source code and keep that going.

236
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,560
And people donate Bitcoin to keep that show rolling.

237
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,840

408
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:12,520
record label or his music publishing or I don't know, he might have produced it because I know

409
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:19,640
Tom Kiefer through Jack Ponty who you got to Google him if you want to talk about Jack. He's

sit down watch something for entertainment purposes one of the few

644
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,700
programs i'll watch is the voice

645
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:46,780
uh... because that to me and and by the way we uh... always record the show

646
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,900
so we can shuttle through not just the commercials or sometimes i'll actually

647
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,940
stop and watch the commercial

if it's entertaining

649
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:57,480

There's no shit on it, which is what I like.

653
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:14,240
So it's all though, you know, cutting the songs down to 90 seconds and stuff.

654
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,960
You know, that's very frustrating to me.

655
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:21,400
But as a music program in prime time, I forget the contest element.

656
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:21,880

659
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:34,840
I think I really didn't like him the first time around the first season or whatever it was or the second or I don't know, or third.

660
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:47,640
But I think he either gave up the Vivance or the changes dosage because he was a little amped out the first, first one or two seasons.

661
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,000
And so now he seems, you know, I don't know.

662
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,320
I have, I kind of like him.

663
01:04:51,320 --> 01:05:01,080
Is something about him that that I find endearing, although he does weird things like he'll do a hug, but with his elbows out, not really hugging somebody and that's that's wrong.

664
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:10,860
