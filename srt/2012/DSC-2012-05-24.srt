00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Delta Sherry Charlie 865. I've got the post idol blues

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
They are with the love that in your eyes

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The prick is a fun down your arms are open wide

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Am I in too deep or should I swim to the shore?

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is this the real thing I don't know?

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I've never been here before

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I feel under in my heart

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But I just can't control

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I feel under in my heart

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And I walk away

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I follow my soul

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I feel under in my heart

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And when it comes from I just don't know

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh no

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There's a star raging

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They've been my soul

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
As I have it when that I just can control

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
As far as the side may I can't explain

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Every time you touch me, my love goes up high

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I've only known you for an hour or more

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
In the time of standing still, you'll never know

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
When I'm the star

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I feel under in my heart

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And I take my breath away

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I feel under in my heart

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But I just can't control

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I feel under in my heart

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And I feel under in my heart

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So I'm pretty cool

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh...

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There's a star raging

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There's a star raging

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There's a star raging

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's a star raging

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There's a star raging

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah there's a star raging

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh...

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Take me baby, I'm all yours

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't guess what you wanted to do with my love

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, not let the night off and take us

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Cause what's happening right now, man

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Make a break us, just feel the way I do

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Open up your heart now, baby, I'm coming through

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I've been in my heart, I'm taking my breath away

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm feeling far in my heart

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a magic never been the same

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's right, it's exactly how I feel

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Like I'm from the rear of my heart

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Once again, we watched the DVR recording of American Idol

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, so many songs, I just like, you know, I need something I'm lifting

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I need to play some real music

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
To music that I remember, songs that you can groove to

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I got a whole emotional journey for you on this Thursday night

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Coming to you from Camp Mofo here in Austin, Tayhouse

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Capital of the drone star state

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
My name's Adam Curry, this is your daily source code

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The Delta Sheriff Charlie, off to a rocky start

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Nothing with the Jack Daniels can't fix

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
First on the tap on the old nagging there

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Make sure it's still made of the same material

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm good

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If I do, I would show it

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Showing you that light

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Cause you love me

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Then in the light I know

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's like thunder, lightning

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So when you love me, it's bright now

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah, I love you, now

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh, oh, oh

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm not super strange, it's like a little strange

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Uh, I can take no train

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah, I begs me for your life

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're moving on middle train

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Club your love

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're better

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And in the land I know

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's like thunder and lightning

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The way that I'm in front of you

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're mad at me, you're mad at me

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're mad at me, you're mad at me

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, baby

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Baby

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Baby, I'm shot by comfort

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Ooh, baby

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Ooh, free bed, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:16,000
-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Since the last time we smoke here on the daily source code, which was, there was it two weeks ago.

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We've had more people die.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's just like, we lost a Beastie boy.

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We lost Donna Summer, we lost us.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's like, if this is part of getting all of this, what it means?

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Is this what it comes down to?

100
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We're gonna honor some of those folks tonight.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I've just played a couple songs and never here on the radio anymore,

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
because I guess they're too cool to be played.

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You choose pride of the name Malaway and a daily source code.

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We're gonna come and the name of our own.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We're gonna come and our own.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We're gonna come and teach us this song.

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We're gonna come and teach us this song.

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We're gonna come and our own.

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We're gonna come and we're gonna come and our own.

110
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We're gonna come and our own.

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We're gonna come and our own.

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
One man lost, one empty face, one man lost, one empty face, one man lost, one empty face, one empty face.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:09:01,420
Kill the angel, one man lost, one empty face, and one man lost, one empty face, one empty face.

Let's get it. Just take those old records home

134
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I've been listening to him by myself

135
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Today's music ain't got the same song

136
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I got all time on rock and roll

137
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Don't try to take me to a disco

138
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You'll never even get the out of the

139
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It didn't mean it found it live for the go

140

I got all time on rock and roll

141
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Just in my little time on rock and roll

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They kind of music just suits the song

143
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I've been listening to about the days of hope

144
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
With that all time on rock and roll

145
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I've been listening to about the days of hope

146
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
With that all time on rock and roll

153
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I've been listening to about the days of hope

154
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
With that all time on rock and roll

155
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I've been listening to about the days of hope

156
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
With that all time on rock and roll

157
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I've been listening to about the days of hope

158
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
With that all time on rock and roll

159
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I've been listening to about the days of hope

160
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
With that all time on rock and roll

161
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I've been listening to about the days of hope

162
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
With that all time on rock and roll

163
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I've been listening to about the days of hope

164
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
With that all time on rock and roll

165
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I've been listening to about the days of hope

166
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
With that all time on rock and roll

167
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I've been listening to about the days of hope

168
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
With that all time on rock and roll

169
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I've been listening to about the days of hope

170
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
With that all time on rock and roll

171
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I've been listening to about the days of hope

172
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
With that all time on rock and roll

173
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I will miss the back of the days of both

174
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
We've had our whole time in Rockin' Roll

175
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Still like that old time in Rockin' Roll

176
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh yeah

177
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That kind of music just suits us all

178
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I will miss the back of the days of both

179
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
With that old time in Rockin' Roll

180
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I still like that old time in Rockin' Roll

181
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That kind of music just suits us all

182
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I will miss the back of the days of both

183
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
With that old time in Rockin' Roll

184
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Still like that old time in Rockin' Roll

185
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Bob is eager to silver bullet band

186
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Old time in Rockin' Roll

187
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That takes me back to 1980

188
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I think it must have been 1981

189
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I was at Salem College in Salem, West Virginia

190
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Playin' that on WITB

191
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Which was an unbelievable ten watts of FM power

192
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Blasting out to all of Salem, West Virginia

193
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And if I remember correctly WITB stood for

194
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Either we're in the basement or we're in to bomb hits

195
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
One or the other

196
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But we were actually in to both by the way

197
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yes, listen, listen, listen, listen

198
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is your daily source code episode 865

199
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Come on you

200
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
From Austin, Tayhouse, the capital of the grown star states

201
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
My name's Adam Curry

202
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You're just conjockey on duty

203
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Bringing you an illegal program

204
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And you must repeat this at a three from your player

205
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
After done, otherwise I might get arrested

206
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
1957, Yohan Holtz was born in Vienna, Austria

207
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
1963, the young child was referred to as a new Mozart

208
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
1977, his alter ego takes control

209
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yohan is now a thousand

210
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
1982, Falcos forces first international hit

211
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
1984, with release of Yohan Roma, Falcos star

212
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Has followed

213
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
1985, starting a new Falcos signs where manager Horst Bork

214
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Bork introduces him to Dutch producers, Ballon Bork

215
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Later, that's same here

216
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
They create the world white hits

217
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The world's all video is in itself, larger than life

218
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The world's all video is in itself, larger than life

219
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The world's all video is in itself, larger than life

The world's all video is in itself, larger than life

244
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The world's all video is in itself, larger than life

245
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
is now a distant memory.

246
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
February 6, 1998, Dominican Republic,

247
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
exhausted after a long and restless night filled with alcohol and cocaine,

248
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Falco awakens alone in his car.

249
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
He turns on to a main road,

250
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
where an oncoming bus approaches at 100 kilometers per hour.

251
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:16,000
paternal Chissent

252
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What's wrong?

253
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The sweat people are not dependent on their sauces

254
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
They've been banished

255
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
There is also our biggestised parkour of the Grand Gly savage Holy Land.

256
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The village to the Stories of the Air configuration and that we do danger for one of the Gates.

257
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Thank you.

258
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:27,000

259
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,880
I'm gonna dance, I'm gonna dance, I'm gonna dance, I'm gonna dance, I'm gonna dance.

260
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:27,000

262
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:27,000

263
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,640
Alright.

264
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,840
I got to run it and die!

265
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,460
You lost on Shi's own tree.

266
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,880
Your lost on Shi's one..

267
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,820
Do you have this for a million?

268
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,120
This is the amount that exists in our lives, what humans are doing towards...

269
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,020
Throughout Flood.

270
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,780
So I...

271
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,920
I might lose a million Blockchain.

272
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,140
Hold up, hold up.

273
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,720
Hold up, youre-

274
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
Boss,ulsar-

275
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,480
Boss,ulsar-

276
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,600
Boss,ulsar-

277
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,200
finite

278
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:45,200
You know, you got to be so careful when your cruise is through the way, you know, you

279
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,200
gotta be so careful when your cruise is through the way, you know, you gotta be so careful

280
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,200
when your cruise is through a Amazon, which is where I get all my MP3's from, which are honestly purchased by the way.

281
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,200
You gotta make sure you get the right versions.

282
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:07,200
And guarantee you, you've not heard of something fucking jack-a-fam, or Bob Fam, or Peter Fam, or Tom Fam,

283
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,200
because it's eight and a half minutes long. It is Falco, Rocky Amadeus.

284
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Of course, produced by the legendary Dutch producing duo Balm and Malen.

285
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Actually, when I met those guys, hey!

286
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,200
When I met those guys, it was my first introduction to show business.

287
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Their manager at the time was this crazy fucking guy called Fritz Hirschlund.

288
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
And he managed Balm and Balm.

289
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
They were going to play another track that they wrote.

290
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,200
And I don't know if they produced it, but I know they wrote it.

291
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,200
And they had kind of basically found Falco, the side of the road, picked him up,

292
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,200
did a remix of this Rocky Amadeus, which is where you just heard.

293
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
And then many remixes since then.

294
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
But this is the first one they did.

295
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,200
And turn the guy into a worldwide sensation.

296
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Almost overnight.

297
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
And of course, he eventually died.

298
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I think he died of a heart failure, but I'm sure it was induced by many other things.

299
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,200
You know, someone just said something in the chat room and everybody.

300
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Someone said, needle on the record, or maybe it was a tweet that I saw something.

301
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
What was that song?

302
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Put the needle on the record.

303
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Put the needle on the record.

304
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
And the drum beat goes like this.

305
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
What was that song?

306
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200

Because I want to play that one for you.

308

This is another Balm and Balm track legendary music producers from the Netherlands.

309
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
This one performed by status quo.

310
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,200
You're in the army now, bitches.

311
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,200
You're on your way to a foreign land.

312
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Now's the time to do what you can here in the army now.

313
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Oh, oh, oh, you're in the army now.

314
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,200
Now you remember what the draft meant say.

315
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Nothing could do all day but stay in the army now.

316
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Oh, oh, you're in the army now.

317
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,200
You'll be the hero of the neighborhood.

318
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Count the days till you're back.

319
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Oh, you're in the army now.

320
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Oh, oh, you're in the army now.

321
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Smiling faces that you wait to land.

322
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,200
But side by side, it'll be over there.

323
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,200
And that you'll agree now.

324
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,200

Now, you're in the lobby now, it's time to tell me about Fridge Hirschlund who is the manager

335
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,880
Of Bob and the ball on the road that's song in the state of school living covered you're in the army

336
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,680
I like it when nice to see Chuck Macamon in the chat room

337
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:20,240
Here's what he says. I remember the song going through my head as I was on patrol in Sarajevo in 1993

338
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
That's a connection to my damn her friends

339
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,560
This guy was nuts

340
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760

341
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480

349
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
So this years-long guy

350
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,200
He was a very very colorful person in the music business back in the day he was in the UK

351
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Young out with the Seymour Hersh

352
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,200
of Sire records if that rings a bell and Seymour Hersh of course is actually the person who

353
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,200
originally signed Madonna to Sire records and made her

354
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
a household name and

355
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,200
I think I visited him once in the UK

356
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,200
I was maybe 18 or 19. It was really weird because these guy were always hanging around young boys and

357
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,200
I felt a little bit uncomfortable and the Seymour was it not her Seymour Stein

358
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
I'm sorry Seymour Stein

359
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
and

360
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Went to Seymour Stein's office

361
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
and he had a fish tank

362
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,200
and the bottom of the fish tank he had a hundred pound note

363
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
but in the fish tank were piranhas

364
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,200
He's like ah go ahead man you go ahead and you just grabbed that hundred pound

365
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
I'm like ah I think I'll pass on that

366
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,200
But then years later maybe three, four years later I was working on MTV

367
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
I was in New Jersey

368
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
I get a call it's fridge, here's London the phone

369
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
He's like hey man I'm in Surinam

370
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,200
I'm here with the Rebels with Desi Bautorsa

371
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
you should Wikipedia that if you want to know what that is

372
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
he says

373
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,200
we need to buy this airplane

374
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
to transport some weapons out

375
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,200
and I need fifteen hundred dollars

376
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
I said you're calling me

377
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
yeah because you can do a Western Union

378
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,200
and like you know this guy I don't know

379
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
you know

380
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,200
he's a weird guy he did weird things in the music business

381
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
you know what I'm going to send it to you

382
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,200
so I send him fifty hundred bucks through Western Union

383
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,200
and it was maybe four or five years later

384
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,200
one day in the mail

385
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,200
three five hundred dollar Western Union

386
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
check show up

387
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,200
which was his repayment

388
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
I didn't pay me any interest

389
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
but he just he did repay it

390
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
and I think maybe two months later he died

391
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
he just killed over

392
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
and I always felt that that was kind of cool

393
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
you know it was kind of like the underground code

394
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
whatever this guy was into

395
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
I did a masala he did one from me back

396
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,200
and that's how the old boys network works

397
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
by the way thank you so much chat room

398
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200

511
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:39,200
I don't think it's in this version, but that's totally sucks, I'll just do it for you.

512
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,200
Put the needle on the right and put the needle on the right and it's a drum beat goes like this.

513
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Well, that was a disappointment.

514
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,200
Bars pump up the volume.

515
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,200
I got to tell you, man, I did these shows late at night.

516
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
I got the studio lights off.

517
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,200
All I got is the glow of the monitors here in the Camp Mofo and Austin.

518
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,200
And even though I'm moving on 48, moving up towards 50,

519
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,200
it still feels like I'm back at decibel radio.

520
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Back at the pirate radio station, Amsterdam.

521
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,200
In 1980, I'm going to say 1982.

522
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
You know, that song was now yet.

523
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,200
That was around the first time that we were introduced to the Beastie Boys.

524
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:26,200
And of course, we lost Adam this year, just a few weeks ago.

525
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,200
And I was trying to think about some stories.

526
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,200
And although, you know, I did hang out with him in Montro one time during the Montro Rock Festival.

527
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,200
And this was when they were totally, totally out of their minds.

528
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,200
And remember they were wearing the Volkswagen emblems back in the day.

529
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,200
All the the rap guys had Mercedes stars.

530
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,200
They would steal off the Mercedes and they would wear those on chains around their neck.

531
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,200
And the Beastie Boys all said they burst onto the scene.

532
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,200
And they were wearing the Volkswagen emblems from the rip off of a beetle.

533
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,200
And I remember we were in Montro and they actually showed me how to remove the Volkswagen emblems.

534
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Volkswagen emblem from a beetle.

535
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,200
And I think the beetle actually was turned over at one point.

536
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
And mine have been lit on fire.

537
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
I can't remember that.

538
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,200
But I do remember back before I met them, which I have fond memories of.

539
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,200
This is a song that you will never hear on the radio.

540
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,200
This is the first track that when we heard this for the first time,

541
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,200
we had an import record company in Amsterdam called Atalos Records,

542
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,200
ATT ALOS Atalos.

543
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,200
And they would get all these import crazy vinyl tracks.

544
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,200
And when we heard this, we played the shit out of it.

545
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
It was so awesome.

546
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,200
And of course it was the Beastie Boys.

547
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,200
The Beastie Boys.

548
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
The Beastie Boys.

549
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200

He's making me it.

614
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Then we weren't tripping balls on that shit, man.

Yeah, it was great.

00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,280
Of course it was.

623
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,480
There was nothing like the Cookie Pulse,

624
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,040
which reminds me of another guy

625
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:34,880
from back in the day.

626
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,200

This is blowfly.

629
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,520
And he had the insight, the foresight,

630
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,800
the future vision to know that one day,

631
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,960
we would have a black president of the United States of America.

632
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

633
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,680
introduce in the first name,

634
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,400
I'm in the first black president of the United States of America.

635
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,160
Presenting blowfly.

636
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,360
Thank you.

637
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,360
Thank you very much.

638
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,960
And like I promised you, when I was running.

639
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,800
I'm gonna make sure they are chillins and every pot.

640
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
Hell, he hooks and every table.

641
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,760
I control peels and every purse.

642
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,800
And we're gonna have a hard day every motherfuckin' weeky.

643
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,800
Thank you.

644
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,960
Good morning, Mr. President, sir.

645
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,960
Good morning, bitch.

646
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,960
I'm at Ms. Clayk.

647
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,400
This shit's gonna be easy.

648
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,560
President, don't do number seven as I ask all day.

649
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,200
And you're bald as any motherfuckin' way.

650
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,600
It's like getting my hair together here.

651
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,240
Where's my fuckin' cocaine?

652
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,440
But the bitch's unmooted again.

653
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,440
Ms. Clayk.

654
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,560
Mr. President, sir?

655
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,880
You get your ass in here, please.

656
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,760
Right away, sir.

657
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,560
What did you do in my ship?

658
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,840
Are you constipated, sir?

659
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,480
Mitch, you know what I'm talkin' about my motherfuckin' road all.

660
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,120
Hell, I took you down to the bed, sir.

661
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,560
Oh, I'm talkin' about coke, coke-ing.

662
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,840
You know that white paddache that I put on your pussy when I'm getting ready to eat it?

663
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,320
Oh, that, sir.

664
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,680
It's right in front of you, sir.

665
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,680
Thank you. That'll be all.

666
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,160
Stupid bitch.

667
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,640
If I put you in so good, I'd fire up.

668
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,640
Miss, I'd get over here and get my hair together.

669
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,640
Ugh.

670
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,640
Ugh.

671
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,640
And some bitch-it.

672
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,640
Mr. President, sir?

673
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,640
Shit.

674
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
What the fuck you want now?

675
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,640
Mr. Jackson is here to see you.

676
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,640
Mr. Jackson.

677
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,640
Reggie Jackson, Andrew Jackson, a macro Jackson.

678
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,640
What, what's one?

679
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,640
Mr. Superfly Jackson, a the United Pimps Association.

680
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,640
What the fuck you want?

681
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,640
He wants the money you promised him for endorsing you.

682
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,640
I told that dumb motherfucker those assholes that Congress got on a phone frozen.

683
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,640
What the fuck you want from my life?

684
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,640
Well, he stated that payment and coke would be sufficient.

685
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,640
Uh, my last coke.

686
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,640
I'm takin' give it to the motherfuckin' get rid of it.

687
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,640
Just in and out shit.

688
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,640
I thought that shit was gon' be easy.

689
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,640
I got it. I got some weed here somewhere.

690
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,640
Here it is.

691
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,640
Room there a couple of joints.

692
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,640
Hmm.

693
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,640
Mr. President, sir?

694
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,640
Shit.

695
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,640
What you want now, Mr. Clay?

696
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,640
Mr. Paul is here to see you, sir.

697
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,640
Mr. Paul.

698
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,640
Paul Newman, Paul Reveal.

699
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,640
Paul Lanker.

700
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,640
Paul John Paul, sir.

701
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,640
John Paul?

702
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,640
What do you want?

703
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,640
And the weed you are currently smoking, sir.

704
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,640
Shit, too.

705
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,640
I just see what name.

706
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,640
I'm not gonna like this motherfuckin' shit at all.

707
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,640
I'll hug you ever to the motherfuckin'.

708
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,640
Can't sniff no coke, can't smoke no dope.

709
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,640
Damn, I know what I do.

710
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,640
Fuck this bitch again.

711
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,640
Miss Clay, would you come in here, please?

712
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,640
Night away, sir.

713
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,640
Come on, oh, you're leaving, pull off your clothes,

714
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,640
which is fire and sound.

715
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,640
I'm down.

716
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,640
I don't wanna hit it shit this morning.

717
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,640
Can't smoke no dope, can't smoke no dope.

718
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,640
Later, later, I can hear all of that shit later.

719
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,640
Shit this shit.

720
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,640
What is the red spots on your stomach?

721
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,640
That's what I was trying to tell you, sir.

722
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,640
What are they?

723
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,640
We see.

724
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,640
I went to the doctor, and he says I have hurt me.

725
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,640
The happys?

726
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,640
I resigned!

727
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,640
Fuckin' hurt me!

728
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:37,640
Whoa, fly, the first black president!

729
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,640
Oh, yeah, man.

730
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,640
That was the year of the base 1982, it was.

731
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,640
I remember it well.

732
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:48,640
And right now, a song that I've been, this is really the whole impetus for me doing this source code.

733
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,640
Just had to kind of get into the mood for it.

734
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:56,640
Because, you know, on the daily source code, we'd like to play songs that you will not hear on the radio.

735
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,640
So, ever again, because it's all been rolled up into one ball of poop.

736
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,640
Thank you.

737
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:06,640
I mean, Romney and being capital and clear channel sucks.

738
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:12,640
So, we still get to share stuff here that you just won't hear anywhere else.

739
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,640
So, we lost another great Donna Summer.

740
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:24,640
I worked with her a couple of times in a couple of shows, not on television shows, but on gigs, I guess.

741
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,640
And she was always, even the early days, she was in Germany.

742
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,640
And she had a huge career.

743
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,640
And in Germany, I don't know if it's still that way, back in the day, man.

744
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,640
You can make so much money.

745
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,640
Because you just keep going on and on forever.

746
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:47,640
And it was back in those days when she hooked up with Georgio Moroder, the famous producer.

747
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:53,640
And by the way, one of our producers at the Noah Genesis show, Dave King actually did the baseline for this song.

748
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,640
It was kind of an ode to him at the same time.

749
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,640
And I was even ending back in fourth of me.

750
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,640
He said, you know, I said, hey, man, it's so awesome that you did that baseline.

751
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,640
I said, I hope you got some kind of royalty for it.

752
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,640
Because it's going to get sold a lot now that Donna Summer has passed.

753
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,640
He said, no, I got paid 160 bucks.

754
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,640
And that was it, buy out done.

755
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,640
And Georgio Moroder is probably in his mid 70s now.

756
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,640
And he's probably enjoying the resurrection of the song.

757
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:24,640
And I'm going to play you the almost 17-minute long version of Love To Love You Baby.

758
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:34,640
With that awesome baseline that I think is the actual nucleus of the song, the music cure, if you will.

759
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:42,640
And if you don't mind, I will slip upstairs and pull myself another jack, or we get into the mood with Donna Summer.

760
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:52,640
When you're laying so close to now, it's the best of luck that you've been with me.

761
00:51:52,640 --> 00:52:22,640
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh

762
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:52,640
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my Oh, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, wow, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my God, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god,

763
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,640
We have down your close to me

764
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,640
So the wind and set me free, set me free

765
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,640
He won't come

766
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

767
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:16,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

768
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

769
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:26,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

770
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

771
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

772
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,640
When you wait so close to me, there is no reason

773
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,640
That you wouldn't let me leave me here

774
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

775
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

776
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

777
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

778
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,640
When you wait so close to me, there is no reason

779
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,640
That you wouldn't let me leave me

780
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:15,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

781
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

782
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:29,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

783
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:38,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

784
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,640
Oh, I'll turn up your baby

785

turns out hell fun, you will becharge the next video, see you in the next video, see you in the next video,

813
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,680
Nice and close, rumbling up against each other.

814
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,680
Now, this is how you pay tribute to someone like Donald Sunder.

815
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,000
I have a little crap that I play in on the radio.

816
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,960
Well, yes, rest in peace.

817
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,960
Fucking Facebook.

818
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,720
Yeah, I got a choice.

819
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:40,200
After my whole, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, if you hadn't heard it, I had a reasonable,

820
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:46,800
a conversation about Facebook on this week in tech, uh, Leo Lecourt Show.

821
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:54,200
And, uh, uh, you know, so, of course, the conversation about this went on and

822
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,800
more people are talking about, and you know, and the other night, if you get any

823
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,200
know what, I'm going to go check out Facebook, see what's on.

824
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:03,880
The only really thing I ever do on Facebook is they're going to terrorize my daughter's

825
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,400
friends.

826
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:10,000
Now, call them Fag, which is the definition of cyberbullying.

827
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:19,000
And, uh, and so, uh, and because I've never on Facebook, I don't get to see anything.

828
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,840
Because Facebook is so incredibly fucking smart that it, uh, then just basically shows

829
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,720
like five friends or something.

830
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:31,000
And I'm a member of the MTV alumni group.

831
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:37,440
And as about 98 people and the people who've worked at MTV over the years, so I check in

832
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:44,440
and the first thing I see is Kevin Gill, a great guy who I work with, uh, I think

833
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:55,440
878889, um, he started as a floor manager, what will we call that, uh, studio producer,

834
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,440
I guess.

835
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:00,440
There was some other name for it, and they don't want to become a director, it was a great

836
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,440
guy.

837
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,440
I loved working with him.

838
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:10,080
There are a lot in the beginning, um, and he died, oh man, really, this is, I'm on Facebook

839
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,440
and all you get is like, this, it's this person's birthday, and that person died.

840
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:19,480
And then, uh, another one of my buddies there, um, on Facebook, who I used to work with a lot

841
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:23,200
also from the MTV group, I see him and say, hey, man, how you doing?

842
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:28,000
He's like, ah, that's a good, I have a lymphoma, like the fuck this Facebook, man, it's

843
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,000
like, nothing, it's nothing but a big fucking downer.

844
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
It's all as good for when you're born and when you're dead.

845
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:42,000
They actually should have a status, this person's dead, you know, be good.

846
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
You should be able to change that.

847
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Hey, I'm dead now.

848
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Look, my Facebook profile.

849
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And what happens is it go away, as your profile just expire eventually, and then it's, uh,

850
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
all run.

851
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Someone should make a parody, 50 ways to leave my Facebook.

852
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Problem is all inside your head, she said to me, the answer is easy if you take it logically.

853
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free, then must be 50 ways to leave her lover.

854
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
She said it's really not my habit to untrue.

855
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost on this constru, but I'll repeat myself.

856
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:36,000
At the risk of being cruel, there must be 50 ways to leave your lover.

857
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
50 ways to leave your lover.

858
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
You just slip out the back, damn.

859
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Make a new plan, stand.

860
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
You don't need to be quite wrong.

861
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Just get yourself free.

862
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I'm on the bus, because you don't need to discuss much.

863
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Just drop off the key.

864
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
And slip yourself free.

865
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Who's about to back?

866
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Yeah.

867
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Make a new plan, stand.

868
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
You don't need to be quite wrong.

869
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
You just listen to me.

870
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I'm on the bus, because you don't need to discuss much.

871
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Just drop off the key.

872
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:20,000
And get yourself free.

873
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
She said it grieves me so to see you in such pain.

874
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again.

875
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I said I appreciate that.

876
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And would you please explain about the 50 ways?

877
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
To leave your Facebook.

878
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
She said, why don't we both just sleep on it tonight?

879
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And I believe in the morning.

880
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
You begin to see the light.

881
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And then she kissed me.

882
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And I realized your property was right.

883
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And must be 50 ways to leave your lover.

884
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
50 ways to leave your lover.

885
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
You just slip out the back, damn.

886
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Make a new plan, stand.

887
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
You don't need to be quite wrong.

888
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Just pitch yourself free.

889
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Or you hop on the bus, because you don't need to discuss much.

890
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Just drop off the key.

891
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And get yourself free.

892
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Just slip out the back, damn.

893
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Make a new plan, stand.

894
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
You don't need to be quite wrong.

895
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
You just listen to me.

896
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I'm on the bus, because you don't need to discuss much.

897
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Just drop off the key.

898
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And get yourself free.

899
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,000
So anyway, so people were posting like RIP Kevin.

900
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Like, what are you going to do?

901
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Are you going to post in there?

902
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Oh, yeah, RIP.

903
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
It's like, if you post on Facebook that you miss someone,

904
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
then it's all good.

905
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And then you feel good.

906
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
This is very, very bad.

907
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
You know, I'm going to blow that shit up.

908
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I think about how to do that.

909
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
We got to blow that shit up.

910
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Anyway, must have been last week, maybe 10 days ago,

911
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
there was an awesome rainstorm here in Austin.

912
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
And we got rainstorms that bring you thunder and lightning,

913
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
like little house on the prairie,

914
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
is as you've never seen a storm like this in your life before.

915
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
So awesome.

916
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And I immediately went to Amazon started downloading thunder

917
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
and lightning and rain songs.

918
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And I was like, ah, they would be so great.

919
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And I waited and waited and waited.

920
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
And of course, the weather just got better.

921
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And we just don't get enough rain here.

922
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
So what I want to do is I want to play this kind of little set

923
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
that I have of rain songs.

924
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And you store this away.

925
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
You know, you're going to download.

926
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
You've already downloaded this obviously.

927
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Store this show away.

928
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And one of those days,

929
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
it's going to be raining.

930
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It's going to be lightning.

931
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
It's going to be thunder.

932
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It's going to be just crazy.

933
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And you're going to pull this episode of the daily source code right out

934
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
of your MP3 player.

935
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
You say, ah, yeah, this is great.

936
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
You're going to find your loved one.

937
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
You're going to cut it up.

938
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
You're going to watch the rain.

939
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And listen to all these songs.

940
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I can't stand the rain.

941
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I can't stand the rain.

942
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I can't stand the rain.

943
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I can't stand the rain.

944
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I can't stand the rain.

945
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I can't stand the rain.

946
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I can't stand the rain.

947
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I can't stand the rain.

948
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I can't stand the rain.

949
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I can't stand the rain.

950
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
That I just can't stand, I can't stand the world

951
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Well, with the pins out of hope

952
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
When it's time you stay, yeah

953
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I only have that sort of sweet memory

954
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
It's like a window, you ain't got nothing to say

955
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I can't stand the rain, it gets my window

956
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Rain, back, swimming, we said

957
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I can't stand the rain

958
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
It's my window, oh, oh, oh

959
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Because he's not here with me

960
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I can't stand the rain

961
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
It's my window, oh, oh, oh

962
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Because he's not here with me

963
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I can't stand the rain

964
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It's my window, oh, oh, oh

965
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Because he's not here with me

966
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Because he's not here with me

967
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I can't stand the rain, it gets my window

968
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I can't stand the rain, it gets my window

969
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
You ain't got nothing to say

970
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I can't stand the rain

971
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
That's my window, oh, oh

972
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I can't stand the rain

973
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I can't stand the rain

974
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I can't stand the rain

975
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I'm behind the waves, back in the day

976
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Your kneestorms are made

977
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
And we're just talking about rain

978
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,240
You know, thunderstorms and rain

979
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
These days, of course, rain stands for the Devil

980
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
That's what Rihanna sings about

981
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
But that's the whole of their story

982
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
If you were for Lehman Bay

983
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
So for this guy, man, I love this fucking song.

984
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Oh, Bruno Mars.

985
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
There's some more feet out of my door.

986
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
It will rain.

987
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Great, too.

988
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Because it would take a whole lot of my dedication.

989
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
To realize what we used to have,

990
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
We don't have it anymore.

991
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
There's no relation that could save me.

992
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,000
No matter how long my knees are on the floor.

993
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Oh, so keep in mind, all the sacrifices I've made.

994
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And we feel by my side.

995
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Keep it from walking up the door.

996
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Because they'll be no side like.

997
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Since I knew you'd be better.

998
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
There'll be no face, guys.

999
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
If I lose you pain, man.

1000
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Because like the clouds, my eyes will do the same.

1001
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:13,000
If you walk away, everything it'll rain.

1002
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1003
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I'll never be your lifeless favorite.

1004
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Oh, you daddy, daddy, now look at me in the eye.

1005
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Oh, I was in that truth.

1006
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I'd be doing the same thing.

1007
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
See my goals, my little girl.

1008
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Walking with that trouble somewhere.

1009
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
But that just the fight I'm solving.

1010
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
They get understated.

1011
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1012
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
You watch me change the mind.

1013
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Yeah, but you watch, I try, I try, I try, I try, I try, I try, I try.

1014
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I make up this broken pieces, tell me, didn't it?

1015
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I don't make a vibe.

1016
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
You're selling yourself like.

1017
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
If I lose you pain, man.

1018
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
They'll be no face, guys.

1019
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
If I lose you pain, man.

1020
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Because like the clouds, my eyes will do the same.

1021
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
If you walk away, everything will rain.

1022
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:51,000
If you'll wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1023
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Oh, I'm talking to say, go back.

1024
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Oh, I'm talking to say, go back.

1025
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Oh, I'm talking to this broken pieces, tell me, didn't it?

1026
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I don't make a vibe.

1027
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
You're selling yourself like.

1028
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
If I lose you pain, man.

1029
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
They'll be no face, guys.

1030
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
If I lose you pain, man.

1031
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Because like the clouds, my eyes will do the same.

1032
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,000
You walk away, everything will rain.

1033
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,000
If I lose you pain, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1034
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Ah, I don't often play new songs on a daily source code.

1035
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
But this is just such an unbelievable track.

1036
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:10,560
Bruno Mars, it will rain, and this is Daddy's source code episode 865 coming to you from a

1037
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:18,480
virtual theater of rain. Well, I just want you to imagine that

1038
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,120
Stark outside

1039
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,120
We've got

1040
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Brain coming down

1041
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:31,440
Been here a little bit of thunder very very slightly in the background there

1042
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:37,040
Some lightning flashes and the temptation slowly come on

1043
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:41,920
We're ending three play and they know

1044
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:00,720
The girl is found another and gone away

1045
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,720
With her with my future my life is still with bloom

1046
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,920
So day after day I still locked up in my room

1047
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:18,960
I know to you in nights I'm strained but I wish you wouldn't rain

1048
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,720
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

1049
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:33,920
But everyone knows that I'm in it's supposed to cry listen

1050
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,320
I got a cry

1051
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,320
Cause crying

1052
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,320
There's the pain

1053
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:46,480
Oh yeah, even though I'm feeling sad

1054
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,880
Words could never explain I just wish it would rain

1055
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,800
Oh, let it rain rain rain rain

1056
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,720

01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:02,400
She's better arms and spun around

1084
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:10,880
And a summer island storm

1085
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,360
In a field of sugar cane

1086
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,920

01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,880

01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,760
And sometimes it rained all night

1089
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,280
And everything she did was perfect

1090
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:45,120
And everywhere we were was right

1091
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:51,760

You kept all raining on the plane

1095
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:16,240
She allowed me for a season

1096
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,600

1097
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:28,720

01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:41,280

And let that summer island storm

1103
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:04,800
It may like a hurricane

1104
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,240
It's like she's right here whispering

1105
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:17,040
Something sexy about the rain

1106
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,560
I'll own me back to the city

1107
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:28,640
And I'll pick you in my mind

1108
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,520
She's still young and she's still pretty

1109
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,640
Even after all this time

1110
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,520
There's something sexy about the rain

1111
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:53,600

01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,960
She's better arms and spun around

1114
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:12,560
And let that summer island storm

1115
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,720
And I feel she became

1116
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:24,000
She dumped me out and shown me on

1117
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:30,000
Something sexy about the rain

1118
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:36,720

For longer term chuckle hedge you'll know that I am a sucker for an ever song

1123
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:20,240
And when Miss Mickey and I did our hotpockets 2008 to her and that was pretty much the only thing you could hear

1124
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,240
On the radio across this great land of ours

1125
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,920
As country stations

1126
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:32,240
I'm playing various degrees of commercial versions of country, but I like this one. Can you

We can't leave out the legendary Diner Washington

1130
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:06,080

That's it and

1132
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,920
In rain

1133
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:23,600
To every word of love I heard you whisper

1134
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:32,400
The rain drop seemed to play our sweet refrain

1135
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:40,880
Those springs had to meet it's still set down

1136
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,440

01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:59,440
To every word of love I heard you whisper

1139
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,440
The rain drop seemed to play a sweet refrain

1140
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:16,400
Oh spring is here to meet it's still set down

1141
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:21,040

In the rain

1145
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:39,200
And that's what you tune into the show for Les Jim

1146
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:46,160
For a musical education to give you stuff that you would never hear otherwise to expose you

01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:50,640
To music that is just out there and you never hear on the radio anymore

1148
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:55,680
Diner Washington September in the rain and when you hear the rain clattering against the street

1149
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,200
Hence the

Maybe it's asphalt but it could be cobblestones I think cobblestones we better and you just want to wish

1151
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,880
Look to you and you want to go

I'm laughing at clouds, so dark up above the sun's in my heart

1156
01:32:54,240 --> 01:33:00,640
And I'm ready for love, let the storm make clouds change

I want to down the lane with a happy refrain just singing singing in the rain

1160
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:32,080
Dancing in the rain

1161
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,600

It's a staple, we all know, but do you ever hear that song anymore?

1171
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,440
I don't think so.

1172
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:44,000
Coming for some time, when it's all the same, it'll rain suddenly, I know, shining down

1173
01:35:44,000 --> 01:36:06,480
the water, I won't know, have you ever seen a rain, I won't know, have you ever seen a rain,

1187
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:19,600

there would be a say, and yes, I have you ever seen a rain, you were holding hands in love,

1194
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:22,080
my first impulse was to run up on you, to a ramble, we bought the jammy and flat glass both of you,

1195
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:29,600
I didn't want to mess up this 30-700 dollar links at home, so instead I chill,

01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:38,960
chill, now it's the bank, took out every dime, and then with the cans from all those credit cards,

everything, if flat with none, I don't want you to be going to don't look in that closet,

1199
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:59,520
because you ain't got nothing, everything you came here with is packed up and put you in the cash

1200
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:06,800
that's right, what was you thinking about, what is trying to prove, this is what the chose,

I can get soups, Gucci handbag, blues diamonds, I can give you things that couldn't even pronounce,

1202
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:19,280
and I can't be in that weather vise, because you're still young, that's right, you're still young,

1203
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:22,000
I hope you learn a valuable lesson from all this, that's right bitch, you know,

1204

and yeah, okay, damn Andrea, because I love you so much,

1209
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:56,880
I don't really have it when it rains, I'm only happy when it's complicated,

1210
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:04,160
I know I know you can't appreciate it, I know they have it when it rains,

1211

I feel comfortable to control it all

1217
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:48,640
I don't feel as if it's outside the sun

1218
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:52,640
I don't wanna be with my hands

1219
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:14,640
I miss my limit though

1220
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:18,640
I'm only comfortable to control it all

1221
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:22,640
I don't feel as if it's outside the sun

1222
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:26,640
I'm only happy when it rains

1223
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:30,640
You get the message that I'm trying to

1224
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:34,640
When I complain about me and you

1225
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:40,640
I'm only happy when it rains

1226
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:44,640
I'm only happy when it rains

1227
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:48,640
You get the message that I'm trying to do

You get the message that I'm trying to do

1230
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:02,640

You get the message that I'm trying to do

You get the message that I'm trying to do

I'm only happy when it rains

1238
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:42,640
I'm only happy when it rains

1239
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:52,640
You get the message that I'm trying to do

1240
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:32,640
I think they played the very first public gig at like an MTV video musical wars and they

1241
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:37,640
were on, I think that was one of those weird shows where they didn't, where they had the

1242
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:45,400
VMAs in New York, and garbage was like, they were on the balcony or something.

1243
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:51,040
I kind of recall both the entrance to, maybe the entrance to Radio City Music Hall,

1244
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:57,360
surely, what's her name again, Shirley Manson, I'd say it's kind of hot, I don't like

1245
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:01,680
her, that's for day of injury, a garbage, I'm only happy when it rains, now here's

1246
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:09,960
what he didn't expect, I knew I'd get you, with what those one-head wonders, blind

1247
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:15,920
melon, remember them, remember that guy used to piss on the audience from time to time, yeah

1248
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:19,360
not much of a career after that, it's not good when you treat your customers that way,

1249
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:28,360
but here's no right on the source code, I like to say it's pretty plain, I like watching

1250
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:41,360
the buttons gather in, and all I can do is just bother deep for two, and speak my point of view

1251
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:57,360
but it's not saying, it's not saying, I just want someone to say me, I'll always be there

1252
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:09,360
when you and me, yeah, you know I like to keep my cheeks dry today, so stay with me

1253
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:23,360
and I'll have it made, and I don't understand why I sleep all day, then I start to complain

1254
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:35,360
and I don't understand why I sleep all day, then I don't understand why I sleep all day, then I don't understand why I sleep all day

1255
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:53,360
but it's a great escape, escape, escape, escape, escape

1256
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:25,360
I'm all I can say is that my life is pretty plain, you know, like my point of view

1257
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:54,360
but it's not saying, it's not saying, I just want someone to say me, I'll always be there when you and me, yeah, you know I like to keep my cheeks dry today

1258
01:49:55,360 --> 01:50:10,360
I don't understand why I sleep all day, scared I don't understand why I sleep all day, then I don't understand what I'm saying

1259
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:13,360
You want to learn running around like a bumblebee?

1260
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:15,360
I think it's for a lot of us.

1261
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,360
No rain, blind melon here.

1262
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,360
And you did a source code episode 865.

1263
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:21,360
Yeah, we got a rain thing going on.

1264
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,360
I don't know.

1265
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:23,360
I just kind of felt like it is.

1266
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:26,360
Nine minutes to one AM here in Austin, Texas.

1267
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:27,360
I'm Adam Curry.

1268
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:31,360
You're a rainy DJ on duty with an original.

1269
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:34,360
That, of course, you can't leave out of a rain set.

1270
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:48,360
Strolling alone, country roads with my baby.

1271
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:53,360
It stops to rain, it begins to pour.

1272
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:57,360
Without an umbrella, we're so too to skin.

1273
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:02,360
I feel a shiver on up my spine.

1274
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:09,360
I feel the warmth of her hand in my hand.

1275
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:14,360
I heal after in the rain.

1276
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:20,360
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.

1277
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:25,360
How I love the rainy day that my happy way.

1278
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:30,360
I feel inside.

1279
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:35,360
After a while, we run under a tree.

1280
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:40,360
I turn to her and she kisses me.

1281
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:44,360
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves.

1282
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:49,360
So fresh she breeze and I close my eyes.

1283
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:56,360
Sharing I love under stormy skies.

1284
01:51:56,360 --> 01:52:01,360
Ooh, how do you laugh during the rain?

1285
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:04,360
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.

1286
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:11,360
Ooh, how I love the rainy day that my happy way.

1287
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:16,360
I feel inside.

1288
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:45,360
I feel the warmth of her hand in my hand.

1289
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:48,360
I heal after in the rain.

1290
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:54,360
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.

1291
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:59,360
How I love the rainy day that my happy way.

1292
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:04,360
I feel inside.

1293
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:07,360
I heal after in the rain.

1294
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:13,360
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.

1295
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:18,360
How I love the rainy day that my happy way.

1296
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:20,360
I feel inside.

1297
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:24,360
You may think this is like totally lame and I'm plainly strong.

1298
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:26,360
Believe me, this is good for you.

1299
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:30,360
I saw we were watching the final episode of American Idol.

1300
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:33,360
By the way, I think it's cool that that Philip Phillips guy won.

1301
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,360
Because he was definitely the most talented.

1302
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:39,360
But you know, then they get the stuff that they play today.

1303
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:46,360
Rihanna comes out with a total Illuminati pyramid all seeing eyeball crabs,

1304
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:48,360
zombified pieces, shit.

1305
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:50,360
Like, you know, this is the kind of stuff.

1306
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:52,360
It will actually lift your heart.

1307
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:55,360
Believe me, it will make you feel really, really good.

1308
01:53:55,360 --> 01:54:00,360
Particularly if, I mean, I know.

1309
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:02,360
I know.

1310
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:06,360
This is really stretching, but I just couldn't resist it.

1311
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:09,360
Listen to all the falling rain.

1312
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:13,360
Telling me just what if you like me.

1313
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:18,360
I wish that if we could go and let me cry and bend.

1314
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:21,360
And let me be alone again.

1315
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:26,360
The only girl I care about has gone away.

1316
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:30,360
Looking for a brand new start.

1317
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:34,360
But a little touch in the window when she left that day.

1318
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:38,360
Along with her, she took my heart.

1319
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:42,360
Rain, please tell me not as I seem fair.

1320
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:47,360
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care.

1321
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:55,360
I can't love another way by heart somewhere far away.

1322
01:54:55,360 --> 01:55:00,360
The only girl I care about has gone away.

1323
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:03,360
Looking for a brand new start.

1324
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:08,360
But a little touch in the window when she left that day.

1325
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:11,360
Along with her, she took my heart.

1326
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:32,360
Rain, won't you tell her not as I look or so.

1327
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:37,360
Please ask the sun to set her heart up low.

1328
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:44,360
Rain and her heart and let the love be new start to grow.

1329
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:52,360
All right, 10 points for the says there in the chat room.

1330
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:57,360
You got to write the cascades.

1331
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:01,360
About the time I was born, listen to the rhythm of the falling rain.

1332
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:06,360
That song of course translated into at least 50 different languages.

1333
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:10,360
Every single country in the world has a version of that song.

1334
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:12,360
It was such a hit back in the day.

1335
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:14,360
Way before the interwebs.

1336
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:22,360
All right, let's wrap up this rain block that we have here with a sad song.

1337
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:26,360
But again, a real song.

1338
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:31,360
I've seen fire and I've seen rain James Taylor on your source code.

1339
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:37,360
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone.

1340
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:43,360
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you.

1341
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:49,360
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song.

1342
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:56,360
I just can't remember who to send it to.

1343
01:56:56,360 --> 01:57:01,360
I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

1344
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:07,360
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.

1345
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:14,360
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.

1346
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:23,360
But I always thought that I'd see you again.

1347
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:26,360
Won't you look down upon me Jesus.

1348
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:30,360
You gotta help me make a stand.

1349
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:36,360
You just got to see me through another day.

1350
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:43,360
My body's aching and my time is at hand.

1351
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:49,360
I won't make it any other way.

1352
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:55,360
I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

1353
01:57:55,360 --> 01:58:01,360
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.

1354
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:07,360
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.

1355
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:17,360
But I always thought that I'd see you again.

1356
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:21,360
I've been looking my mind to many as a time.

1357
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:25,360
My back turns all the sun.

1358
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:27,360
Don't notice when the cold wind blows.

1359
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:30,360
It'll turn your head around.

1360
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:33,360
Well it's hours the time on a telephone line.

1361
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:37,360
To talk about things that come.

1362
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:43,360
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground.

1363
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:49,360
Well I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

1364
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:55,360
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.

1365
01:58:55,360 --> 01:59:01,360
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.

1366
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:06,360
But I always thought that I'd see you baby.

1367
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:10,360
One more time again and now.

1368
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:17,360
I've seen you one more time again.

1369
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:21,360
It's just a few things coming my way this time around.

1370
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:24,360
Many different interpretations of what this song is about.

1371
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:27,360
But I asked James Taylor about her once.

1372
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:31,360
He said he wrote it after coming out of a very deep depression.

1373
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:34,360
So that's what we used to do back in the day.

1374
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:39,360
You'd be depressed and then you feel really crappy about things that happen in your life.

1375
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:44,360
And you know either you write a song about it or you find someone who would written a song.

1376
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:48,360
You'd play that song and you'd feel better and it could lift your spirits.

1377
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:50,360
And these days you know we just take a pill.

1378
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:52,360
Like a riddle.

1379
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:53,360
Not really.

1380
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:54,360
I don't know.

1381
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:55,360
They don't want it.

1382
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:56,360
They don't want it.

1383
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:58,360
They eventually will make you kill yourself.

1384
01:59:58,360 --> 02:00:00,360
So there you go.

1385
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:01,360
All right.

1386
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:02,360
I'm going to wind this now.

1387
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:03,360
I'm drunk now by the way.

1388
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,360
I've had three glasses of Jack hefty glasses of mine.

1389
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:10,360
And that's just shock glasses of a real glasses.

1390
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:14,360
I did want to pay tribute to Robin Gibb and actually,

1391
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:18,360
while I'm at it, Maurice Gibb and Andy Gibb.

1392
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:20,360
Three of the Gibb brothers gone.

1393
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:23,360
Barry Gibb still left over.

1394
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:28,360
And the you know, I've been paying it a little bit of attention to mainstream media.

1395
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:30,360
How they've been portraying it.

1396
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:33,360
And it's talk about the BG's about the disco.

1397
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:35,360
It's like that's so much bull crap.

1398
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:41,360
If you really know your music history, these guys wrote so many amazing songs.

1399
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:47,360
And they really did emerge on the scene back in the days of the kinks of the Beatles,

1400
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,360
the Rolling Stones.

1401
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:50,360
And they've always gotten a really bad rap.

1402
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:53,360
But of course, that's how mainstream works.

1403
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,360
You know, you do a couple songs.

1404
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:58,360
And they really only did a couple songs for Saturday Night Fever.

1405
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:01,360
And also they're the disco kings.

1406
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:04,360
And I know that they personally were very frustrated by it because

1407
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:09,360
I met them several times when they had their one album out.

1408
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:12,360
What's the name of the song? You win again?

1409
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:15,360
Which was a huge number one hit everywhere.

1410
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:18,360
They were one of my shows.

1411
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:22,360
And I remember they were like, you know, they didn't come out and say it as such.

1412
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:26,360
But I knew that they were very, they was like, you know, like fuck that.

1413
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:30,360
And Robin was a very, very cool guy.

1414
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:32,360
It's total geek, by the way.

1415
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:35,360
He had the geekiest watches.

1416
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:38,360
And he was into all kinds of technology shit.

1417
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:40,360
And it's just been bad luck for this family.

1418
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:42,360
It's just been really, really sad.

1419
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:45,360
So I wanted to play a song from the BGs.

1420
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:48,360
Who, of course, their music goes back to the very early 60s.

1421
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:52,360
This is one of my all-time favorite BG songs.

1422
02:01:53,360 --> 02:02:09,360
I started a joke.

1423
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:17,360
It started the whole, well, crying.

1424
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:22,360
I didn't see.

1425
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:27,360
I'm the chill for the mean.

1426
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:31,360
Oh, no.

1427
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:35,360
I started to cry.

1428
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:42,360
Which started the whole, well, laughing.

1429
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:49,360
Oh, it might at least be.

1430
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:54,360
And the chill for me.

1431
02:02:54,360 --> 02:03:00,360
Oh, it looked like the skies.

1432
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:07,360
Running my hands over my eyes.

1433
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:12,360
And I fell out of bed.

1434
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:20,360
I'd seen my head from things that I said.

1435
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:25,360
Until I finally died.

1436
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:32,360
Which started the whole, well, living.

1437
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:39,360
Oh, it might at least be.

1438
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:44,360
I'm the chill for the mean.

1439
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:50,360
I looked at the skies.

1440
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:57,360
Running my hands over my eyes.

1441
02:03:57,360 --> 02:04:03,360
And I fell out of bed.

1442
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:11,360
I'd seen my head from things that I said.

1443
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:15,360
Until I finally died.

1444
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:23,360
Which started the whole, well, living.

1445
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:30,360
Oh, it might at least be.

1446
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:37,360
That the chill for me.

1447
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:50,360
That the chill for me.

1448
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:55,360
Almost here, the warble in the 45 on the record player when they digitized this.

1449
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:56,360
Can't you?

1450
02:04:56,360 --> 02:04:59,360
Maybe it was the real, the real, the BG's.

1451
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:03,360
I started a joke here on your daily source code episode eight, six, five.

1452
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,360
I hope you're enjoying the show.

1453
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:06,360
It's been a weird one.

1454
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:08,360
But I mean, that kind of mood.

1455
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:10,360
I'm going to be 48 on September 3rd.

1456
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:12,360
And I'm so fucking happy.

1457
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,360
I'm alive.

1458
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:14,360
And I feel good.

1459
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:15,360
I'm healthy.

1460
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:19,360
And this is, I was not going to John about this.

1461
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:21,360
John, see the Vorac.

1462
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:23,360
I think it was off air.

1463
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:28,360
It's like, you know, you get older and just people are dropping around you.

1464
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:30,360
And it's like, what the hell, man?

1465
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:35,360
I mean, why am I so lucky? Why do I get to stay around?

1466
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,360
And I really don't care.

1467
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:40,360
I'm just happy I'm here.

1468
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:44,360
And I'm going to share as much of that love that I get from the music with you guys as I can.

1469
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:47,360
This is one of my favorite songs.

1470
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:48,360
I love this woman.

1471
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,360
Chuck a con through the fire.

1472
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:55,360
I look in your eyes and I can see.

1473
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:59,360
There's nothing interesting.

1474
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:04,360
You're not trusting your heart to anyone.

1475
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:10,360
You tell me you're going to play it smart.

1476
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:14,360
We're through before we start.

1477
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:20,360
But I believe that we've only just begun.

1478
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:28,360
When it's this good, there's not something more.

1479
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:34,360
I want you so I'm ready to go.

1480
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:40,360
Through the fire, to the limit to the war.

1481
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:48,360
For Chuck to be with you, I gladly lift you all.

1482
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:55,360
Through the fire, whatever I lay.

1483
02:06:55,360 --> 02:07:02,360
For Chuck to lie to you, I take it all the way.

1484
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:15,360
Right down to the wall, even through the fire.

1485
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:20,360
I know you're afraid of what you feel.

1486
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:24,360
It's still any time to feel.

1487
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:29,360
And I can put you lonely, let me drive.

1488
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:35,360
You touch me and something in the room.

1489
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:39,360
For I could have been you.

1490
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:45,360
I'm not a baby to kiss the green goodbye.

1491
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:53,360
When is this sweet, there's no say no.

1492
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:58,360
I need you so I'm ready to go.

1493
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:04,360
Through the fire, to the limit to the war.

1494
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:12,360
For Chuck to be with you, I gladly lift you all.

1495
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:19,360
Through the fire, whatever I lay.

1496
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:26,360
For Chuck to lie to you, I gladly lift you all the way.

1497
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:35,360
Right down to the wall, even through the fire.

1498
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:46,360
Through the fire, to the limit to the war.

1499
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:54,360
For Chuck to be with you, I gladly lift you all.

1500
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:59,360
Through the limit to the war.

1501
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:04,360
For Chuck to be with you, I gladly lift you all.

1502
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:08,360
Through the limit to the war.

1503
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:14,360
For Chuck to be with you, I gladly lift you all.

1504
02:09:14,360 --> 02:09:18,360
Through the fire, to the limit to the war.

1505
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:25,360
For Chuck to be with you, I gladly lift you all.

1506
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:31,360
Through the fire, to the limit to the war.

1507
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:36,360
Through the limit to the limit to the war.

1508
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:40,360
All right, to know how songs bring back memories, right?

1509
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:43,360
I think I was 20 years old.

1510
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:51,360
It was in the tiny, tiny apartment of a grown-man to Esther.

1511
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:55,360
An Esther, ah, Esther Tollin.

1512
02:09:55,360 --> 02:10:00,360
She was the lead singer of the Novo band.

1513
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:03,360
Oh, man, it's coming back to me now.

1514
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:06,360
It was like a one-hit wonder band, the Novo band.

1515
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:10,360
They had a, what's the name that's song?

1516
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:13,360
Let's see, like, a soap and book of knowledge.

1517
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:15,360
Let's go dancing.

1518
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:19,360
And I'd been on television for maybe six months or so.

1519
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:21,360
And it was an Utrecht.

1520
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:26,360
And as she'd been on the show, and then she was doing a gig somewhere with the band,

1521
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:29,360
with the Novo band, never heard from again.

1522
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:32,360
And she said, yeah, you should come and watch us or watch the show.

1523
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:35,360
And I went down and, and I remember that.

1524
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:40,360
I was, I was like completely smitten about her, completely.

1525
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:44,360
When back to her apartment, and we were making out just,

1526
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:46,360
I got to, I got to play the song for it.

1527
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:47,360
She played this song.

1528
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:49,360
Chaka Khan through the fire.

1529
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:53,360
And it was like this, one of those magical moments.

1530
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:56,360
Ah, 30 years ago.

1531
02:10:57,360 --> 02:11:01,360
Alright, now let's fast forward to 2012.

1532
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:05,360
I promise I play this one for my lovely Miss Mickey,

1533
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:10,360
the woman who I will marry on July 16th.

1534
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:12,360
This was for you, baby.

1535
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:21,360
Her absolute, one and only favorite Neil Diamond track.

1536
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:25,360
Jack on the rocks, or love on the rocks.

1537
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:27,360
Love on the rocks.

1538
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:31,360
He knows the price.

1539
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:37,360
This for me a drink, and I tell you some lies.

1540
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:45,360
And nothing to lose, so you're just seeing the blues.

1541
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:48,360
All the time.

1542
02:11:48,360 --> 02:12:00,360
Gave you my heart, give you my soul.

1543
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:06,360
He left me alone here with nothing to hold.

1544
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:11,360
Yesterday's gone.

1545
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:17,360
Now all I want is a smile.

1546
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:27,360
First they say they want you.

1547
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:31,360
They have really lead you.

1548
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:35,360
Suddenly you've planned you're out there.

1549
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:37,360
Walking in the stars.

1550
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:42,360
And when they know they have you.

1551
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:46,360
And they really have you.

1552
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:49,360
Nothing you can do or say.

1553
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:53,360
You got to leave just get away.

1554
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:58,360
We all know the song.

1555
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:04,360
You need what you need.

1556
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:07,360
You can say what you want.

1557
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:14,360
Not much you can do when the feeling is gone.

1558
02:13:16,360 --> 02:13:19,360
Maybe it blew skies above.

1559
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:24,360
But it's cool when you lose on the rocks.

1560
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:31,360
First they say they want you.

1561
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:34,360
They have really lead you.

1562
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:38,360
Suddenly you've planned you're out there.

1563
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:40,360
Walking in the stars.

1564
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:45,360
And when they know they have you.

1565
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:49,360
And they really have you.

1566
02:13:50,360 --> 02:13:53,360
And they really have you.

1567
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:56,360
Nothing you can do or say.

1568
02:13:56,360 --> 02:14:00,360
You got to leave just get away.

1569
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:06,360
We all know the song.

1570
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:11,360
Love on the rocks.

1571
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:15,360
They know big surprise.

1572
02:14:16,360 --> 02:14:19,360
Just pull me a dream.

1573
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:27,360
Yesterday's gone.

1574
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:33,360
And all I wanted is a smile.

1575
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:40,360
I think all the jazz singer,

1576
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:44,360
on Netflix will watch that.

1577
02:14:44,360 --> 02:14:46,360
That'll get her in the mood.

1578
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:49,360
You'll diamond love on the rocks.

1579
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:52,360
He's going on tour.

1580
02:14:54,360 --> 02:14:57,360
He's starting in a week or so.

1581
02:14:57,360 --> 02:14:59,360
All right.

1582
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:01,360
Let's see what time is it now.

1583
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:02,360
115.

1584
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:04,360
And I'm kind of keeling over.

1585
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:06,360
It's been a very long day.

1586
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:08,360
We got the no agenda show this morning.

1587
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:11,360
Which means I usually get a very, very early.

1588
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:13,360
Of course, after going to bed very late.

1589
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:15,360
Because that's usually how it works.

1590
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:17,360
Reading government legislation.

1591
02:15:17,360 --> 02:15:18,360
All kinds of other stuff like that.

1592
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:19,360
But I'm so happy.

1593
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:21,360
I was able to share a couple of good tunes with this.

1594
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:23,360
And buddies in the chat room, no agenda street.com.

1595
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:27,360
Where you can always hear some kind of crazy ass show going on.

1596
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:28,360
Thank you.

1597
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:29,360
Get most laid for.

1598
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:33,360
Connecting me into the live sort stream.

1599
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:34,360
Thanks.

1600
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:37,360
Everybody in the chat room who was hanging out and keeping me company.

1601
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:40,360
I'm going to play one last song.

1602
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:41,360
It's one of those long ones.

1603
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:42,360
It's a live version.

1604
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:43,360
It's eight minutes.

1605
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:45,360
A little over eight minutes.

1606
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:47,360
And there's just one.

1607
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:51,360
One part in this song that gets me every single time.

1608
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:53,360
And I'll be singing it really, really loudly.

1609
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:55,360
I won't come back after it though.

1610
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:57,360
Because nothing like your mom is saying,

1611
02:15:57,360 --> 02:16:00,360
I know why you ain't going to sing that song, girl.

1612
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:03,360
But I'm talking about.

1613
02:16:04,360 --> 02:16:06,360
Ready, right?

1614
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:09,360
Tonight is the night.

1615
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:11,360
And if you haven't had your night tonight,

1616
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:14,360
I want you to go and find your love one on half that night.

1617
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:15,360
So they come out and share.

1618
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,360
And all the love.

1619
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:19,360
Because you know you can make love.

1620
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:20,360
Like no one else.

1621
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:22,360
You don't have a real good chance.

1622
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:23,360
That's right.

1623
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:24,360
That's right.

1624
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:25,360
We have it, man.

1625
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:26,360
Is that all right with you?

1626
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:27,360
That's all right, Betty.

1627
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:28,360
Thank you so much.

1628
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:31,360
Now, this is a tune that I compose.

1629
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:37,360
And it's called tonight is the night.

1630
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:38,360
See you soon, everybody.

1631
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:40,360
That you make me a walk.

1632
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:41,360
A source code.

1633
02:16:41,360 --> 02:16:44,360
I never intended recording this song.

1634
02:16:44,360 --> 02:16:47,360
It was a personal point.

1635
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:52,360
That isn't till the day that my producer happened to throw through the pages of my notebook.

1636
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:55,360
He came across the words, and he said,

1637
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:57,360
We've got to do something with these words.

1638
02:16:57,360 --> 02:16:59,360
It's happening every day.

1639
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:01,360
And people want to hear about it, Betty.

1640
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:13,360
You see, it's the story of a young girl making love for the very first time.

1641
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:23,360
Now, when I finally got a melody, I took it home and I played it for my mother.

1642
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:27,360
And I got to tell you a little bit about my mother.

1643
02:17:27,360 --> 02:17:29,360
You see, I come from one of those pretty large families.

1644
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:31,360
And I'm the baby of the family.

1645
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:34,360
And you know, you never grow up to your mother.

1646
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:38,360
I never forget the way she looked at me when I played it for her.

1647
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:42,360
She said, I like the music.

1648
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:46,360
You know, baby, the melody is really nice.

1649
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:49,360
But I know you're not going to sing that song.

1650
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:53,360
But we've used the right home by the beginning.

1651
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:56,360
And if it came one of my biggest records too,

1652
02:17:56,360 --> 02:17:59,360
So I want you to do this for me if you will.

1653
02:17:59,360 --> 02:18:09,360
Everybody, think back to your very first time.

1654
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:25,360
Now give it a little while longer, because I know some of you have to think back a little bit further than others.

1655
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:30,360
Come on now, I want you to play catch up.

1656
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:33,360
And I don't want you waiting till I get to get some of my songs to hear.

1657
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:35,360
Oh yeah, now, remember?

1658
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:43,360
Now, whether it was good, or you just smiled and it was good.

1659
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:49,360
All the other hand, if it was not so good, here's my stone.

1660
02:18:56,360 --> 02:19:09,360
Tonight is the night, that you make me your warm mind.

1661
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:18,360
You said to be gentle with me, and I hope you'll be happy.

1662
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:23,360
I'm nervous, and I'm trembling.

1663
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:28,360
I'm waiting for you to walk in.

1664
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:35,360
I'm trying hard to relax, but I just can't keep still.

1665
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:41,360
No, I can't give you a car to stand.

1666
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:47,360
I won't play bigger than for all my senses, man.

1667
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:52,360
But I know so little about what love is.

1668
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:56,360
I just can't help acting like a child.

1669
02:19:56,360 --> 02:20:01,360
Like I can't do my job, hand your ring in my bed.

1670
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:06,360
Hope you're not impatient after waiting until they're long.

1671
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:10,360
Oh, hold me up with my silly hands.

1672
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:15,360
And we're both holding up to no right or wrong.

1673
02:20:16,360 --> 02:20:25,360
Tonight is the night, that you make me your warm mind.

1674
02:20:25,360 --> 02:20:34,360
You said to be gentle with me, and I hope you'll be happy.

1675
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:40,360
I'm nervous, and I'm trembling.

1676
02:20:40,360 --> 02:20:45,360
I'm waiting for you to walk in.

1677
02:20:45,360 --> 02:20:55,360
I'm trying hard to relax, but I just can't keep still.

1678
02:20:55,360 --> 02:21:05,360
No, I can't give you a car to stand.

1679
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:12,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1680
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:17,360
I'm waiting for you to walk in.

1681
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:22,360
And I can't just do it what we are doing.

1682
02:21:22,360 --> 02:21:31,360
Not only will I never really die, but my whole family relationship, it'll all be ruined.

1683
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:36,360
But we're both holding up to no right or wrong.

1684
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:40,360
Oh, hold me up with my silly hands.

1685
02:21:40,360 --> 02:21:44,360
And we're both holding up to no right or wrong.

1686
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:50,360
And I hope you're not impatient after waiting until they're long.

1687
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:57,360
Tonight is the night, that you make me your warm mind.

1688
02:21:57,360 --> 02:22:04,360
You said to be gentle with me, and I hope you'll be happy.

1689
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:07,360
I'm waiting for you to walk in.

1690
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:12,360
And I hope you'll be happy.

1691
02:22:12,360 --> 02:22:22,360
I'm waiting for you to walk in.

1692
02:22:22,360 --> 02:22:29,360
Oh, hold me up with my silly hands.

1693
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:35,360
And we're both holding up to no right or wrong.

1694
02:22:35,360 --> 02:22:38,360
And I hope you'll be happy.

1695
02:22:38,360 --> 02:22:43,360
I'm waiting for you to walk in.

1696
02:22:43,360 --> 02:22:49,360
And I hope you'll be happy.

1697
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:56,360
I'm waiting for you to walk in.

1698
02:22:56,360 --> 02:23:02,360
And I hope you'll be happy.

1699
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:09,360
I'm waiting for you to walk in.

1700
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:16,360
Oh, hold me up with my silly hands.

1701
02:23:16,360 --> 02:23:22,360
And I hope you'll be happy.

1702
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:29,360
I'm waiting for you to walk in.

1703
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:36,360
Oh, hold me up with my silly hands.

1704
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:43,360
And I hope you'll be happy.

1705
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:49,360
I'm waiting for you to walk in.

1706
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:56,360
And I hope you'll be happy.

1707
02:23:56,360 --> 02:24:02,360
I'm waiting for you to walk in.

1708
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:19,360
And I hope you'll be happy.
