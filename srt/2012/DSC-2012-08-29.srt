00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Delta Sherry Charlie 866.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,760
This is the Lunar Edition.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,760
Hola.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,760
Super Nano Yenshi.

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,760
One, two, three.

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,760
I'm the man.

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,760
I am the man.

8
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,760
I'm the man.

9
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,400
Just a moon and a country possesses strange powers.

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,780
Or is it all just a moon a safe place?

11
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,780
16.

12
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,780
16 minutes and seven minutes ensuring five lines of time.

13
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,780
Turn.

14
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,780
The 21st century of radio starts here.

15
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,780
The only loss of thinking can't fear me.

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,780
Oh, my.

17
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,780
I know it's in the three dots.

18
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,780
I'm a f**kastic.

19
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,780
It's a new curry.

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,780
Let's take a bath to the moon, baby.

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,780
I'm sitting around with you.

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,780
How I'm craving you.

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,780
Oh, yeah.

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,780
Everett's have a naked eye.

25
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,780
Oh, my.

26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,780
I'll be right here if you see me there.

27
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:10,780
In my eyes, I'll need you here.

28
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,780
Don't ask why.

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,780
I'll never disappear.

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,780
Why is it every day that I feel the pain?

31
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,780
Yeah.

32
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,780
Let's take a trip to the stars far away.

33
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,780
I will never stay with you.

34
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,780
I'll stay bringing to the dead.

35
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

37
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

38
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

39
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

41
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

42
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

43
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

44
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

45
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

46
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

47
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,780
My pain is cause by my pressure.

48
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

49
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

50
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

51
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,780
My pain is caused by my pressure.

52
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:35,780
I use it every day, and then I'll feel the pain

53
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,780
Now, yeah

54
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,780
Now

55
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,780
Now

56
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,780
Now

57
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,780
No

58
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:34,780
I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you

59
00:03:34,780 --> 00:04:04,780
I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you,

60
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:34,780
I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you,

61
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,780
We pray for silence

62
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,780
We keep from making our nights

63
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,780
Bad news is calling

64
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,780
These return to kill the light

65
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,780
And when these families love people

66
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,780
They're silly and wrong

67
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,780
Can you hear me?

68
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,780
Fucking the moon

69
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,780
Ha ha ha

70
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,780
replicated

71
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,780
Do tell me

72
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,780
Maybe the movie is crazy

73
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,780
Goly has reason

74
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,780
There to go pretending to see

75
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,780
His head's are empty

76
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,780
His Chest is broken

77
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:42,780
Let me go, let me stay home, and I don't need him, but I don't know.

78
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,780
Hey, yeah, I don't know.

79
00:05:48,780 --> 00:06:06,780
They just didn't marry me, but love this game, and though he's time to stop and go, go,

80
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:24,780
it can't be burning, no, I'm holding you on, but please return to the road, it's not wrong, we have made it.

81
00:06:36,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go

82
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:36,740
Let him go, let me go, let me go, let me okay close my eyes, I'll kill you, I'll see that broken house with this

83
00:07:36,740 --> 00:08:05,980
That's obviously what it's there for, just how and back at it.

84
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,980
But there's another big question we have to ask, and then I get answered after there's still a source car, I tell you.

85
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:20,980
Sometimes it just takes a little bit of emotional energy to get me all around, not to bring another dead source car, and this is one of those days.

86
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,980
They've been to 20,000,000 to 12.

87
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,980
And we hear our Lord.

88
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,980
Where we are asking you several questions.

89
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,980
Here's the Lord.

90
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,980
Really made of cheese.

91
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,980
A lot of me are plug-in here, let me get everything set up.

92
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,980
Yeah, that's a devour act, I don't know how long I got you, thank you.

93
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,980
Oh yeah.

94
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,980
We got at least an hour and a half, maybe two hours.

95
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
Awesome.

96
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,980
This is for you here on the Charlie.

97
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
As we roll down.

98
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,980
Six, six.

99
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
This is the murder edition.

100
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,980
As you want, just lock it to keep the planetary space travel, if you will.

101
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,980
You've been black crawls.

102
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
But no creep in.

103
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,980

See what you got back and back, yeah, you can see

176
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I've been with you, I've been with her, I've been with her

177
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,400
See what you got back, yeah, you can see

178
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,400
I've been with her, I've been with her, I've been with her

179
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
We're sending out and ending

180
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:30,400
I'm going to show you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of an

183
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:37,040
little bit of how it's gonna be a good day and we have the Official porn star of the Charlie Showing, the Shadowama条 paint stream.com, no chin-to-chat.net!

184
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,440
Welcome Bobbi Eden, keeping all the humorion-reetsers, and retain them all happy.

185
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,160
I'm gonna be breaking this down on a minute.

186
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Let me know exactly what we are doing this show.

187
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,720
But it's all a good thing because, Hey!

188
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,320
No matter which way you look at it, we´ve got another Daily SourceGorde.

189
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,380
Yeah, and Gree!

190
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,680
fuck all of you, wear aío drug.

191
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:08,680
I see a fair move of right and I see trouble on the way

192
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,680
I see fair moves of right and hit

193
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,680
I see bad times a day

194
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,680
Don't worry about tonight, but if I don't take your dad

195
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,680
I see fair moves of right and hit

196
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,680
I see fair moves of right and hit

197
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,680
I know the end is coming soon

198
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,680
I see a real move of right and hit

199
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

200
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Don't worry about tonight, but if I don't take your dad

201
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,680
I see fair moves of right and hit

202
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

203
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

204
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

205
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

206
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

207
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

208
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
I see a fair move of right

209
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

210
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

211
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

212
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
I see a fair move of left and hit

213
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

214
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

215
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

216
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

217
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
I see a fair move of right and hit

218
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,680
There you've been moving on the right.

219
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,680
Don't worry about tonight.

220
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,680
Almost finally take your day.

221
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,680
There you've been moving on the right.

222
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
It's Credence.

223
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Bad moon rise in here on the Daily Source Code.

224
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,680
This is episode 866.

225
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
And my name is Adam Curry.

226
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,680
You're a podcaster on duty for this entire episode.

227
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Good to have you all back for the ride.

228
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Let me tell you how this show got started.

229
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,680
First of all, I've been thinking about doing another day.

230
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
The source code for a while now.

231
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,680
We got back from our our tour.

232
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,680
Actually, somewhere during the last.

233
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
I'd say the the last week of the.

234
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,680
I started to get kind of a little bit of an inching a little bit.

235
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,680
Like, oh, man, I got to get going.

236
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,680
I got to start doing this stuff.

237
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,680
This Mickey of course is always goating me into.

238
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
It's like, yeah, I'll get the whiskey.

239
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
And by the way, not a drop so far today.

240
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Right now, it's 430 in the afternoon here in the.

241
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
The drone star state in Austin, Texas.

242
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,680
But I'm sure, Mickey, I'll walk in a little bit with a beer to get me really rolling.

243
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
And I have a couple of shows.

244
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
And I'm thinking about.

245
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
I'm thinking about doing a truck and drive and show.

246
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,680
I'm thinking about doing a firefighting show.

247
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
And I'm kind of more into this theme stuff that we haven't.

248
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,680
You know, they seem to be kind of getting into a little bit recently.

249
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,680
So here's how it started for those of you who do not know.

250
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,680
It was very interesting that I was on to it.

251
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,680
This week in tech would be able to port yesterday.

252
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Was it yesterday?

253
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Not two days ago on Sunday.

254
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Today is Tuesday.

255
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,680
And I kind of got last so into something.

256
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,680
And even though on the show, it was actually, I thought, kind of okay.

257
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,680
It really spun out of control in the.

258
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,680
In the blogger sphere, the Twitter sphere.

259
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,680
And it's something that I just, I noticed so many interesting things.

260
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,680
Surrounding what I had said that it warranted a little bit of a discussion.

261
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,680
And, you know, when I get, you know, riled up and I've got no one else to talk to.

262
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
Because I can't call the war act.

263
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
We only talk twice a week on the show.

264
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
I might as well be talking to you guys.

265
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
So let me, you know, let me play.

266
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,680
And I'll stop this and give some commentary.

267
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,680
Let me play a little bit from what happened on this week in tech.

268
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
He's got it down.

269
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
He doesn't have to practice anymore.

270
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,680
But I've been told if, if I should pass away during the show, you can perform.

271
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
I got you.

272
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
I got you.

273
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
You're got me.

274
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
I got you back.

275
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,680
So actually, the, the top star will lead off with a, with a, with a story that is not apples.

276
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Sam, so I'm shocking to everybody.

277
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Yesterday, Neil, I'm strong passed away.

278
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,680
The first person to walk on the moon at the age of 82.

279
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
Adam, do you, do you actually believe that he walked on the moon?

280
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,680
I just should check probably before we talk about this.

281
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
Now, this is where the immediately got interesting.

282
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,680
And of course, Leo Leport full well is fully well aware of my stance on the,

283
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
Oh, thank you, darling.

284
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
Right on cue.

285
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Love you.

286
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
Bobby says hi.

287
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,680
She's in the chat room.

288
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Oh, this is a fireman's number four.

289
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Blondale.

290
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
Okay.

291
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
Hold on a second.

292
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
Hmm.

293
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,680
So anyway, so Leo is fully well aware of my, my position,

294
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
which you could call crack pot, whatever.

295
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,680
And if he's about to do some kind of eulogy to,

296
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,680
to the arm strong, it makes, doesn't make a lot of sense to jump right in with me.

297
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,680
And by the way, this is such a big red herring.

298
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,680
And I didn't know how bad it was really until I saw the response.

299
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
Because of course, when I'm, no matter what show I'm doing,

300
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
I would tweet as well.

301
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
I'm looking at the chat room.

302
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
I'm trying to see what's going on.

303
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,680
And in my response, I could only answer honestly.

304
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Well, I have to be honest that I do not believe that he walked on the moon.

305
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
Because I was right.

306
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
I was going that land.

307
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,680
Good call.

308
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Okay.

309
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
So we're going to answer it on a good time.

310
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
It's funny.

311
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
You know, let's laugh at the crack pot.

312
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
That's cool.

313
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
All right.

314
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Now, I'm okay with that.

315
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
You can say it.

316
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,680
And unfortunately, he took the secrets of that within two is great.

317
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,680
Well, this is, now, I'm, maybe I shouldn't have said that.

318
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
But it isn't lying with my conspiracy.

319
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,680
And now at this point, I'm not getting into flags, not waving into shadows,

320
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
into all kinds of stuff.

321
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
And just so you understand,

322
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:13,680
I really only questioned certain types of space travel and that landing on the moon.

323
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:20,680
For some scientific reasons, which is very hard for anyone to prove otherwise.

324
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:26,680
And I was just giving an honest answer, not trying to jump in being a super conspiracy nut.

325
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
So not trying to sound like one.

326
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,680
I already know that just bring it up is enough.

327
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,680
But this, by the way, is a thing that's happened to Richard Bells or the other day on Pierce Morgan.

328
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:46,680
With the first question out of the gate about his new book, which is about, I think is what is it, 15 stories.

329
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
About American government.

330
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
You don't know.

331
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
It doesn't include JFK assassination, et cetera.

332
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,680
And you, whenever someone starts off with, so do you think we landed on the moon?

333
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Basically, the only answer you can give is, well, of course I do.

334
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,680
If you answer any differently, you are crazy.

335
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,680
But even worse than that.

336
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,680
But I'll get into that in a moment.

337
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
I've always used to like that.

338
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:13,680
NBC.com posted a story where they said, first guy to walk on the moon, nearly young past.

339
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,680
So here I am trying to kind of steer the conversation away.

340
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,680
And you know, a little more fun direction.

341
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Just to, you know, to bring it more back to what I know about, which is how dumb the media is.

342
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
They were the first, they were the first with the story.

343
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
And I guess sometimes typos happen.

344
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,680
And these people make a lot of money to do this.

345
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Wow.

346
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,680
I had a lot of, I was out at a bar yesterday.

347
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,680
And I heard a lot of people wondering if it was a landstorm strong, who'd passed away.

348
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,680
There was a lot of, so at this point, this is Nile, who I incorrectly called Nile,

349
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,680
or some crap like that.

350
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
You'll hear that.

351
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
You know, so now we could have moved on from here.

352
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,680
It would have been easy for the host to take this and move on.

353
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
It's really, really depressing stuff.

354
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Yeah.

355
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Yeah.

356
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Well, the good news is I'm sure there'll be quite a few documentaries and, you know,

357
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
people will be talking quite a bit about it.

358
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,680
And I think as we begin our exploration of Mars, it's really good to remember back to Nile.

359
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
I'm strong in those first words.

360
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Yeah.

361
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,680
Okay. So at this point, I just, I'm just pouring it on because, you know,

362
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,680
I'm not anyway, the chat room is exploded with hate.

363
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,680
It's another one I really don't believe in, Nile.

364
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,680
You know, if you, I'm trying to take it to Mars, right?

365
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
Let's take it to the Mars rover.

366
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Let's steer away from Neil Armstrong.

367
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,680
You put a picture of what the curiosity Mars rover has taken,

368
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
which always seems to take pictures of itself.

369
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
You put a picture of that into Google.

370
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,680
The Google API will say, would you like to see other pictures from New Mexico?

371
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Now, this is not a conspiracy theory.

372
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
This is a true.

373
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,680
If you try it at home, you'll see this as well.

374
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Well, it looks a lot like New Mexico.

375
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
All right.

376
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Admittedly.

377
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Admittedly.

378
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,680
Well, regardless of whether or not you think we landed on a moon

379
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,680
or the curiosity landed on Mars, you have to admit that the effect of inspiring

380
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,680
a whole generation of scientists and people interested in space.

381
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
That's a good thing, right?

382
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,680
And I have to say, I like what, this is a Catholic priest of the, the Jesuit

383
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Society of Jesuits of what is a father of the Robert Padre S.J.

384
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,680
is what he's known as, and on Twitter.

385
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
And he's actually, he's okay.

386
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
He's kind of respectful.

387
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,680
And which is why I probably didn't hammer into him.

388
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,680
He was like, oh, do you believe that the moon was made by God?

389
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Which I did get an answer from him later on Twitter, which I'll get into.

390
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,680
I mean, even with all the other, I wouldn't say Adam has to admit anything,

391
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
but let's ask him.

392
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Well, no, it's nice to get people's imagination rolling.

393
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,680
And I like all the 3D renderings that we saw of the sky crane and the parachute and the landing.

394
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Of course, we never really saw any of that.

395
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
We just saw the 3D renderings.

396
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
They were beautiful.

397
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Well, done.

398
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
The seven minutes of terror.

399
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
I'm impressed.

400
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,680
You really don't believe what would be the incentive.

401
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,680
There was no reason.

402
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
No reason to go back to this.

403
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,680
We could have let it lie for the government to, or NASA, to fake this.

404
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,680
Oh, just more money.

405
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:16,680
There's, it's a tiny bit of money compared to, you know, air conditioning, the troops in Afghanistan.

406
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,680
Wow, that was, that was a can of worms right there.

407
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,680
Now, this could have been my opportunity.

408
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
And I did think about it.

409
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
It's like, wow, you know, I could get into all that stuff.

410
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
But, you know, this is a tech show.

411
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,680
We're supposed to be talking about technology and science.

412
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,680
And so I think you can have an alternate view, possibly.

413
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,680
Now, I'm going to try and wrap this up and pull back a little bit and just say,

414
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,680
Hey, man, you know, there's other thoughts out there.

415
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,680
You know, basically trying to say, you know, consider an alternative of a paper instance.

416
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,680
I mean, really, it's a few billion dollars that way.

417
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:52,680
I, you know, I've put a lot of work into the into the moon landing.

418
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,680
And, you know, there's, there's just a lot of different theories about how that would work.

419
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,680
If you can get through certain parts of space to actually get out that far.

420
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Now, I'm opening it up here for anyone who has read at least any of the so-called denialism to talk about

421
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,680
the Van Allen belts, which could actually be a pretty interesting conversation with the knowledge

422
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:19,680
that NASA has had just delayed, I guess, because of the hurricane near the Gulf Coast.

423
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:26,680
They're sending off two Allen belt probes, Van Allen belt probes into space to find out, you know,

424
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
more about this stuff.

425
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:34,680
Because, you know, this fry satellites, it fries all kinds of integrated circuits.

426
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:45,680
And this is one of the main theories as to why we did not go to the moon 50 years ago, almost 50 years ago,

427
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,680
46 years ago, I guess.

428
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Because, you know, going through that radiation belt would essentially fry the equipment and,

429
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,680
perhaps even the human beings onboard.

430
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,680
And this is something that, you know, we could have gotten into.

431
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,680
And if you look up the Van Allen belts, it's very hard for people to prove that it is possible to go through.

432
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:14,680
And, you know, that we had in a very topical, we could have had a very topical conversation about the probes that are being launched.

433
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Of course, no one else knows about, because all they know about is the stupid rover on Mars.

434
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,680
I'm just not wholly convinced that, you know, people call me a crackpot.

435
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
So there you go, I'm saying, I'm not wholly convinced.

436
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,680
I'm not saying, oh, it's not too big conspiracy.

437
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
You know, Kubrick, I didn't do all that.

438
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
It just laid low.

439
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
So be it.

440
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
I'm, I have to really keep to my guns on this one.

441
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
I'm really just not completely convinced.

442
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,680
I am dragging pictures of, uh, uh, from curiosity.

443
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,680
And I don't, I'm not getting new Mexico yet.

444
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
But I'll, but I'll keep doing it.

445
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
No, I don't, let me get your input on this one.

446
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,680
I, I got a costed by a few YouTube users who are trying to convince me that,

447
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,680
the Mars we see in the sky is actually just a big inflatable place there by the government.

448
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,680
So you don't actually know where Mars is.

449
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,680
No, no, no, I'm not on that thing.

450
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,680
I mean, I, I actually, there are bases on the moon and on Mars not necessarily.

451
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Again, I'm opening it up to talk about some alternative theories.

452
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:19,680
And by the way, I've never understood why people will believe that we've landed on the moon.

453
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,680
We'll believe that we have, uh, the Mars, uh, rover, the curiosity.

454
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:32,680
But then, of course, completely will ignore any anomalies that are seen in pictures or video.

455
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,680
There's no way there's UFOs.

456
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,680
There's no, all that is all explainable.

457
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,680
They're open to that, but they're not open to anything else.

458
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
That always surprises me.

459
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,680
And, uh, who knows what the, with the ultimate agenda is, you can Google Project Bluebeam.

460
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Now, this is a, a no agenda crackpot theory.

461
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,680
I had to throw in, um, and you should Google Project Bluebeam.

462
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,680
Um, uh, and again, no one picked up on it.

463
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
That may be one.

464
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
There's a, a number of different theories out there.

465
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,680
So I'm, you know, it's hard for me if I haven't seen it with my own eyes.

466
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,680
That is the core of my argument.

467
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,680
If I haven't seen it with my own eyes, then I'm just not, that ready to jump and then believe it.

468
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
Why?

469
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,680
Because I've been in television all my life.

470
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,680
I mean, if you believe you saw these guys landing on the moon and I remember my parents woke me up and I sat in front of the television.

471
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
I can distinctly remember.

472
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
I'm like, oh, what?

473
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:35,680
But if you, uh, will believe what you saw there, then why not believe, you know, in what you see on Star Trek or what you see in, in other science fiction.

474
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Why not believe the hunger games?

475
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Why not believe any special effects?

476
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Why not believe it?

477
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
This is what astounds me.

478
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
I have a hard time believing things.

479
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
I can respect that.

480
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Yeah.

481
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Okay.

482
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Nice.

483
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Father, uh, the Robert there saying that I can respect that.

484
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
Great.

485
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
And he should.

486
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
I respect his view.

487
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Now, here's what was interesting.

488
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,680
Uh, so an entire shitstorm of tweets, you know, and here's what I was called.

489
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Uh, uh, people saying he called Neil Armstrong a liar.

490
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,680
Well, no, I didn't call him a liar.

491
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
I, you know, I didn't.

492
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Those words did not pass through my lips.

493
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,680
Um, so people saying it's the same thing.

494
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
All right.

495
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
That's one.

496
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Uh, the other favorite I got is, um, you're a Holocaust denier.

497
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,680
You know, or on the same level as a Holocaust denier.

498
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
Wow.

499
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,680
You know, that was like, okay.

500
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
That's pretty big.

501
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,680
At one point, someone even called me a stupid Republican.

502
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:42,680
Now, that to me was fascinating that somehow a questioning the moon landing or not being a,

503
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,680
a, the being an anti moon truther, I guess.

504
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Uh, make sure we're Republican.

505
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,680
And that's something I got to talk with the, uh, with John about on, uh,

506
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,680
I know agenda for sure because that's basically how program we've become.

507
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,680
But this was like, it was like some kind of jihad.

508
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,680
It was really, really quite amazing to see all the hate coming through.

509
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
And all of that, you know, I can handle that.

510
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,680
And went back and forth and I even brought up, uh, about father Robert.

511
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
I mean, you know, it was like, hey, you know, I should have asked them if he

512
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,680
believes it to some guy in the sky, uh, created the moon.

513
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,680
And he didn't get back to me on Twitter.

514
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,680
And he, very smart these Jesuits.

515
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:31,680
He says, no, I, uh, I believe, uh, in the, um, uh, what do you call it in the, uh,

516
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
evolutionary theory.

517
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,680
I'm like, wow.

518
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
So here's a Catholic priest.

519
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Uh, and I was specifically, uh, a Jesuit who believes in, um, evolutionary theory.

520
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:53,680
And his reasoning behind that is that God gave him the power to reason.

521
00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:00,680
And therefore it's okay, which I think is a brilliant, brilliant way of playing

522
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:07,680
it, essentially saying, um, hey, you know, if, if God created everything, then he also

523
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,680
created this, you know, this idea.

524
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,680
And the reasoning behind it, which is, I mean, incredibly smart.

525
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,680
By the way, I'm very interested now in Father Robert.

526
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,680
And, and, and, and what his deal is, because from what I understand, the Jesuits call themselves

527
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,680
the Marines of God.

528
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
And you know, they think of vowels at celibacy.

529
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,680
So, you know, we should send Bobby Eden to Father Robert.

530
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,680
I bet we could fix him real quick.

531
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,680
And I know she'd be up for it.

532
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Um, you know, so that, but their mission is to literally propagate the word of God.

533
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,680
And I think there was, uh, there was a quote somewhere.

534
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Let me see if I can find that on my, uh, maybe I put that in my only in my Twitter stream.

535
00:31:52,680 --> 00:32:00,680
I'm not sure, uh, because it was just interesting that he does have, uh, in a agenda.

536
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Let me see.

537
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Did I put that on my link blog?

538
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,680
Or did I probably only on my Twitter?

539
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
Well, I was second.

540
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Hmm.

541
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,680
I'd be worth it to find that one.

542
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,680
It was like,

543
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:26,680
I'm scrolling down here.

544
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Like, oh, here it is.

545
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Conquering the web for Christ.

546
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,680
So, this is, it's just an interesting, interesting guy.

547
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,680
And I'd like to know more about there's a lot of trash talk about the Jesuits on the web as well.

548
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,680
By the way, that the Jesuits or the true Illuminati and all this stuff.

549
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:51,680
By the way, Father and J. Padre as SJ, if you ever listened to the show, Bobby Eden says she's up for it.

550
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Ha ha ha.

551
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,680
Hey, I'm jealous now.

552
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,680
So, but that, that was, you know, okay, so I don't mind a little back and forth.

553
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
You know, hey, you don't kill the cow before you milked it, right?

554
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,680
I mean, I'm thinking for the lone wolf belligerence out there that are going to hear this.

555
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
And there have been quite a few.

556
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,680
And I got a lot of supportive messages and emails.

557
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,680
You know, we'll get some more listeners for the show.

558
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
And maybe we can save a few souls.

559
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,680
You know, we're conquering the web for our own version of Christ, I guess.

560
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,680
But then Leo, and this is what blew me away.

561
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,680
He's out there tweeting.

562
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,680
And let me, I don't want to misquote him.

563
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
So I'm going to bring up his Twitter feed right now.

564
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,680
Nice internal server error, really Twitter.

565
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,680
Here it goes.

566
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,680
Let me just bring up his tweets.

567
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,680
Okay.

568
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,680
Uh, blah, blah, blah.

569
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,680
So, first I says, the real devour act refuses to be on the show.

570
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
The same show with Adam Curry.

571
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,680
Now I know why.

572
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,680
We were honoring a great man and Adam called him and all of NASA a liar.

573
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Not my proudest moment.

574
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,680
Well, I didn't call all of NASA and him a liar.

575
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Um, now he already says, uh, Adam is a really smart guy with some strange beliefs.

576
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,680
I never saw that coming.

577
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Yeah, you did.

578
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,680
But what's more interesting.

579
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,680
He says, no one believes me, but I've never listened to no agenda.

580
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Conspiracy nuts irritate me too.

581
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,680
And, uh, we, uh, here is I agree.

582
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,680
We booked Adam Curry much earlier than before, uh,

583
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,680
Neil Armstrong's death, which is not true because they literally booked me, uh, Sunday,

584
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,680
Saturday night.

585
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,680
I had no idea he disbelieved.

586
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,680
I was shocked and didn't rebut as I should have.

587
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,680
And then my favorite, I was blindsided by Adam.

588
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,680
I apologize.

589
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,680
And now it, you know, so I'm like, well, that's really lame.

590
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
That, that's, that's, that's it.

591
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,680
It, it was always not true.

592
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,680
Second of all, it wasn't all that bad.

593
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,680
But, you know, he's, what is he afraid of?

594
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
Yeah, I miss Mickey actually.

595
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
He said, Adam, he has advertisers.

596
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
Don't you understand that?

597
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,680
You know, intellectually, I get it.

598
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
But come on.

599
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,680
So, I think actually the moon hoaxer week he had, uh, had an entry on me,

600
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,680
which was erased, which I'm sad about because I thought it was pretty good.

601
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,680
But if you actually listen to the real context and the things I said, you know,

602
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,680
I'm not, you know, some kind of holocaust denier.

603
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,680
I'm not all these horrible things.

604
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,680
But to me, the veracity and the anger that this provokes in people,

605
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,680
I mean, if, if I had said, oh, you know, a 9-11 was an inside job,

606
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,680
blessed people would have cared them about this.

607
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,680
To me, that was truly, truly astounding.

608
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,680
And, you know, we're talking about it.

609
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,680
You know, last night and today's thing is it's still going on.

610
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,680
Of course, as a podcast, lots of people are getting it.

611
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,680
And, and then I said, you know, I should probably do a show about this.

612
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,680
I'll do the lunar edition and Mickey's of course.

613
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,680
Yeah, hey, hell now.

614
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,680
And, well, luckily, I've got tons of tracks.

615
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
Thank you very much again, Marcus Cows for, uh,

616
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
pretty much getting all the tracks.

617
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,680
I wanted to get and I got a couple, a couple other ones, which I think you'll enjoy.

618
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,680
So, uh, we'll just run through it here and, uh, we'll talk some more about, you know,

619
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,680
being a Republican.

620
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Really?

621
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
I don't know.

622
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
How are they, like, left?

623
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,680
I think they can start.

624
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,680
I said, I'd like to travel at night.

625
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
I'm afraid to stay here, you're fine.

626
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,680
I was gonna pick up our travel for them.

627
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
Can you open the room?

628
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
And I'm ready.

629
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,680
Here we go.

630
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
There we go.

631
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Thank you.

632
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,680
Thank you.

633
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,680
Thank you, remember me?

634
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Is there anybody out there?

635
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,680
Is there anybody out there?

636
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Is there anybody out there?

637
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,680
Is there anybody out there?

638
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Is there anybody out there?

639
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,680
Is there anybody out there?

640
00:37:44,680 --> 00:38:14,680

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,680
another video, see you in the next video, see you in the next videos, see you in the next video, and check out the next video, see you in a next video

650
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
I'm going to do it.

651
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
I'm going to do it.

652
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,680
I'm going to do it.

653
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,680
I'm going to do it.

654
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,680
I'm going to do it.

655
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,680
I'm going to do it.

656
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
I'm going to do it.

657
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,680
I'm going to do it.

658
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,680
I'm going to do it.

659
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,680
I'm going to do it.

660
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,680
I'm going to do it.

661
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,680
I'm going to do it.

662
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,680
I'm going to do it.

663
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:31,680
I'm going to do it.

664
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,680
Remember that whole album man, how awesome the police were then?

665
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:45,280
So that will of course be the song for this episode in history.

666
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,400
As I know, go down as a crazy nut, a Republican holocaust denier.

667
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,560
Ah, that's a bad joke, where probably.

668
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:00,000
But it does say a lot about how we think about things in the world.

669
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And he was funny.

670
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,320
I got an email for someone who said, you know, I don't trust what NASA tells me.

671
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:12,360
But I do trust the myth busters, like, oh man, so I have when I looked in the myth busters,

672
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:18,600
they have a video episode where they went up and apparently the astronauts left a reflector

673
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:25,800
behind and they show how the reflector's work and then they go to this Apache point or something

674
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,440
I believe.

675
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,200
And this up must be up somewhere, maybe it's Alaska, I don't know where Apache point is.

676
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,400
And there's a giant laser.

677
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,800
And then what you see is the lady says, okay, initiating laser and she clicks on the mouse.

678
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,760
And then you see the little bit of green flashing and of course you can't see the laser

679
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,760
like coming back.

680
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,400
That has to be registered on a computer screen.

681
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,120
They see it a little line go up and there it is, we're receiving photons back from

682
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,120
the moon.

683
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,120
It's proof.

684
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,120
The science is in.

685
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:07,320
I know you're somewhere out there somewhere far away, I want you back, I want you back,

686
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:21,080
I never think I'm crazy, I don't understand, you're all ahead, you're all ahead.

687
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:39,080
And I win the stars, I'm on my own, I sit by myself, talking to them all, trying to get

688
00:45:39,080 --> 00:46:01,120
out of the sky, talking to me, talking to me, talking to them all, talking to them all,

689
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:19,680
oh I'm feeling like I'm sayin' me is the top of the town, I say I've come on, I have come

690
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:27,400
I didn't know what I know, because when the sun goes down so much talking back again

691
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:37,400
And I'd win the stars like on my own

692
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:48,400
I sit by myself, talking to the moon

693
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Trying to get to you

694
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,400
And hold your hands on the other side

695
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,400
So I can't stop it, so I'm on my own

696
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,400
So sit by myself, talking to the moon

697
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,400
And hold your hands on the other side

698
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:32,400
So I can't stop it, so I'm on my own

699
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:39,400
So sit by myself, talking to the moon

700
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:46,400
And hold your hands on the other side

701
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:57,400
So I can't stop it, so I'm on my own

702
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,400
So sit by myself, talking to the moon

703
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,400
We play a lot of old tunes on the daily source code

704
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,400
But this I would say is one of the best artists of our time

705
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,400
No Mars

706
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,400
What the voice, love the production, love the look, love everything

707
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
Just fantastic, talking to the moon

708
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,400
And of course the moon really is something incredibly special

709
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,400
When you think about it, I was a surprise

710
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
Miss Mickey and I were in the car, we know

711
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,400
I need some moon songs

712
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
And he just think about that so many songs

713
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,400
About the moon and the romance it's involved in it

714
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,400
And it really warrants a full chuckle dedicated to it

715
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,400
That's what you're getting now

716
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,400
Fly me to the moon, let me play

717
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:52,400
Among the stars, let me see what spring is like on

718
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:58,400
A Jupiter and Mars, in other words

719
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,400
Hold my hand

720
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,400
In other words

721
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,400
Baby kiss me

722
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,400
Fill my heart with song

723
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,400
And let me sing forever more

724
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:28,400
You are all I long for, all I worship and the dawn

725
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,400
In other words, please be true

726
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,400
In other words, I love you

727
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Fill my heart with song

728
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,400
Let me sing forever more

729
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,400
You are all I long for

730
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,400
Fill my heart with song

731
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,400
Let me sing forever more

732
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:32,400
You are all I long for, all I worship and the dawn

733
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:40,400
In other words, please be true

734
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:49,400
In other words, in other words

735
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,400
I love you

736
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,400
You are all I am

737
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,400
You are all I am

738
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,400
You are all I am

739
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,400
You are all I am

740
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,400
You are all I am

741
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,400
You are all I am

742
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,400
You are all I am

743
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,400
You are all I am

744
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
You are all I am

745
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,400
You are all I am

746
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,400
You are all I am

747
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,400
You are all I am

748
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,400
You are all I am

749
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,400
You are all I am

750
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,400
She was standing in the lane

751
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,400
Trying how to speak my name

752
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:11,400
They say first love and love on time

753
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:20,400
The way to more the memories in the tiny clouds

754
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:27,400
We stumbled over once we long to hear

755
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,400
We talked about the dreams we lost

756
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,400
We are giving up

757
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,400
When always took up the light

758
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,400
And she said it's from my light

759
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:55,400
As the last dream walked on the moon

760
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,400
Though summer nights

761
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,400
When we were young

762
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,400
We cried the dreams

763
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:09,400
We never done we were dreamers

764
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:14,400
Only dreamers

765
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,400
And in our hands

766
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,400
You brought us home

767
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,400
We left our innocent

768
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:27,400
On there's a group we were dreamers

769
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,400
Only dreamers

770
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:36,400
On there's a moon

771
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,400
On there's a moon

772
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,400
On there's a moon

773
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,400
There's a moon

774
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:17,400
There's a world we'll see

775
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,400
The memories for us

776
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,400
I still can hear goodbye

777
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,400
On the summer nights

778
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,400
It echoes in the mountains

779
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,400
of my heart.

780
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:48,400
The night is doing and waiting for the dead as a train.

781
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,400
I know what we meant to say.

782
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,400
All our chances swept away.

783
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Still remain on the road to the door.

784
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:12,400
The summer nights, when we were young,

785
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:20,400
we bring the pain, we never thought we would dream of.

786
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,400
Only three months.

787
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,400
All this past and time comes on,

788
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,400
with dreams we made,

789
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,400
for just as long as there's people.

790
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,400
All the dream goes on,

791
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,400
and there's more.

792
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,400
And there's more.

793
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:56,400
All this.

794
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,400
There's no.

795
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,400
Wow, that takes me back.

796
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,400
I think we made this the a lot of Skype,

797
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,400
which back in the day when I was working Veronica Radio

798
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,400
and the Netherlands was like the hit pick of the week.

799
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,400
He of course is the voice of sticks,

800
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:38,400
you know, and from babe I believe in Dennis D. Young Desert Moon.

801
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,400
I don't mark his couch, hated it,

802
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,400
or was excited to hear it.

803
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,400
I'm not quite sure.

804
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,400
So of course we have a lot of new listeners popping in on the stream,

805
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,400
or jenestream.com, as the Dennis source code is always produced live.

806
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,400
And then later release for podcast completely against all regulations.

807
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,400
I could go to jail.

808
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,400
And so I'm just running down the Twitter stream.

809
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,400
Of course, I appreciate all of the the no agenda and fans

810
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,400
and the chuckleheads who are posting great stuff there.

811
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,400
Here's one from surter as you are.

812
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,400
Adam Curry, the music you play is terrible.

813
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,400
Yeah, okay.

814
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,400
Let me see what else we got here.

815
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,400
There's always something fun.

816
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,400
Oh, this is always another one.

817
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,400
The tech gurus says Adam Curry,

818
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,400
I don't know, landing on the moon is not complicated,

819
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,400
but who knows, maybe Hiroshima was faked too.

820
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,400
To this, I don't understand how you can equate

821
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,400
that type of conversation with each other.

822
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,400
It's always very interesting.

823
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:52,400
Steve K says Leo LaPortitz.

824
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,400
I think it's time to sever all ties with Curry,

825
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,400
and never do business with him again.

826
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,400
The man is a nut job.

827
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Certified, crazy, I tell you.

828
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,400
Yeah, well, dude.

829
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,400
I was slow dancing with Bobby Eden in the chat room during that song,

830
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,400
so I don't know.

831
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,400
Maybe you're just envious?

832
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,400
What?

833
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,400
Time to get my 80's vibe on.

834
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,400
Can't do without your hand.

835
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,400
Shit.

836
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:28,400
You got me coming.

837
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,400
I said it.

838
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,400
Can't do without me.

839
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,400
Maybe I can't get you right.

840
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,400
I couldn't believe that much pain,

841
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,400
but I'll wait till you decide.

842
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,400
Stay with me when I'm excited.

843
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,400
As if I make you never hide.

844
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,400
The less I'm not in love,

845
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,400
I love by the chance we've given both of you.

846
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,400
No, no, no, no, no.

847
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,400
From the five days through the night.

848
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,400
I stay with you, babe.

849
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

850
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

851
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

852
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,400
I stay with you, babe.

853
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

854
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

855
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

856
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

857
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

858
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

859
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

860
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

861
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,400
I love by the chance we've given both of you.

862
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,400
No, no, no, no.

863
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,400
From the five days through the night.

864
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,400
I stay with you, babe.

865
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

866
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

867
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

868
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:49,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

869
01:00:49,400 --> 01:01:06,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

870
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

871
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:16,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

872
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:22,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

873
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:30,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

874
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,400
Will I miss out on my mind?

875
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:42,400
I stayed the whole day when I lost my life

876
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:50,400
If you know my name, I knew my name through the night

877
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:58,400
I stayed the whole day when I lost my life

878
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,400
If you know my name, I knew my name

879
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:09,400
Of very interesting conversation, the chatroom, if I would accept an apology

880
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:13,400
Or if I'd never go on to it again, are you nuts?

881
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,400
Of course I'll go on to it again, are you kidding me?

882
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,400
I think if anything, the whole conversation about display advertising

883
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,400
That probably pissed Leo off

884
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,400
But I thought that was actually the crux of the entire broadcast

885
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,400
And I urge you to go and watch or listen to that

886
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,400
It was really good

887
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,400
And you're saying so myself

888
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,400
Stay with the heat, he's vibe

889
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,400
How else can you not play REM on a show about the moon?

890
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,400
My love before it became my life

891
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,400
Made it again

892
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:49,400
And become the rest of the galaxy

893
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,400
Made it again, yeah, yeah, yeah

894
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,400
Not between anyone, check there's a chance

895
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

896
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:05,400
Mr. Fred Lassie in a breakfast house

897
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah

898
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,400
Let's wait to ester, let's play REM

899
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah

900
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,400
See you in heaven if you may

901
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:29,400
Now, Andy, did you hear about this one?

902
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,400
Tell me, are you locked in the past?

903
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:37,400
And yeah, you could've been on it all the same

904
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,400
Are we losing touch?

905
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:49,400
If we leave, they've heard a man on the moon

906
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:54,400
If we leave, they've not set up this thing

907
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,400
They've not let us go

908
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,400
Those who swim walk in the staff room

909
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,400
They can't even get there

910
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,400
You can't even get there

911
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,400
You can't even get there

912
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,400
Each and every struggle by the horrible hours

913
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

914
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,400
Mr. Fred Lassie in a breakfast house

915
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah

916
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,400
Andy, did you hear about this one?

917
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,400
Tell me, are you locked in the past?

918
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,400
And yeah, you could've been on it all the same

919
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,400
Are you having fun?

920
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:54,400
If we leave, they've heard a man on the moon

921
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,400
If we leave, they've not set up this thing

922
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,400
They've not set up this thing

923
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,400
You can't even get there

924
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,400
You can't even get there

925
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,400
You can't even get there

926
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,400
You can't even get there

927
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,400
You can't even get there

928
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,400
You can't even get there

929
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,400
You can't even get there

930
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,400
You can't even get there

931
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,400
Andy, did you hear about this one?

932
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,400
Tell me, are you locked in the past?

933
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,400
And yeah, you could've been on it all the same

934
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,400
Are you having fun?

935
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:10,400
If we leave, they've heard a man on the moon

936
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:18,400
If we leave, they've not set up this thing

937
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,400
They've not set up this thing

938
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,400
They've not set up this thing

939
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,400
They've not set up this thing

940
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,400
They've not set up this thing

941
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:56,400
If we leave, they've heard a man on the moon

942
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,400
They've not set up this thing

943
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,400
They've not set up this thing

944
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,400
They've not set up this thing

945
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,400
If we leave, they've heard a man on the moon

946
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,400
If we leave, they've heard a man on the moon

947
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,400
If we leave, they've not set up this thing

948
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,400
They've not set up this thing

949
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:30,400
Adam Koo, the second best thing you can do by yourself

950
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,400
In the morning

951
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:50,400
Ground control to major time

952
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:56,400
Ground control to major time

953
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,400
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on

954
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,400
Ground control to major time

955
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,400
Six, come and sink on down and jump

956
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:21,400
Three, two, check in, wash them and make a slow view with you

957
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:38,400
This is ground control to major time

958
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:43,400
You've really made the grade

959
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:49,400
And the papers want to know who shuts you away

960
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:55,400
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

961
01:08:55,400 --> 01:09:00,400
This is major tone to ground control

962
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,400
I'm stepping through the jaw

963
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:10,400
And I'm floating in the most peculiar way

964
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:16,400
And the stars look very different today

965
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:22,400
Here, I'm my floating rabbit again

966
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:28,400
For above the world

967
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:35,400
Flimate of this blue and there's nothing I can do

968
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:03,400
The one past one hundred thousand miles

969
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,400
The moon healing very still

970
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:12,400
And I think my special knows which way to go

971
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,400
Tell my work my love learned very much

972
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,400
You'd know

973
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,400
Ground control to major time

974
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,400
You're stuck in debt

975
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,400
That's something wrong, can you hear me, major tone

976
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,400
Can you hear me, major tone

977
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,400
Can you hear me, major tone

978
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,400
Can you hear me, major tone

979
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,400
Can you hear me, major tone

980
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,400
Can you hear me, major tone

981
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:50,400
Can you hear me, major tone

982
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,400
Can you hear me, major tone

983
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:57,400
Can you hear me, major tone

984
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,400
Can you hear me, major tone

985
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,400
Can you hear me, major tone

986
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,400
Can you hear me, major tone

987
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,400
Can you hear me, major tone

988
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,400
Can you hear me, major tone

989
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:11,400
She back, my bags last night, where he fly

990
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:18,400
Zero hour night. Yeah

991
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,400
And I'm gonna be high

992
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:51,400
I'm as the girl so much, I'm as my wife, it's lonely out of space, on such a time

993
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,400
I am less white

994
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:10,400
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time, took time to turn around and get to find

995
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:19,400
I'm not the man, they think I am a mom, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

996
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:29,400
Rock it man, run it out of you that I'll get lost

997
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:37,400
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time, took time to bring my stronger right

998
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:48,400
And I think I am a mom, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

999
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:53,400
Where did you love it long?

1000
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:04,400
More than kind of place to raise your kids

1001
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,400
In fact, this cold is now

1002
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:18,400
And there's no one there to raise them

1003
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,400
If you do

1004
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,400
And all the science, I don't understand

1005
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,400
It's just my job, but it isn't weird

1006
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:45,400
Or rock at the back

1007
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,400
Rock at my hand

1008
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:58,400
Now I think it's gonna be a lot more time

1009
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,400
We've talking now, brings me around and can do fine

1010
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,400
No more%, man not think I am at home

1011
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:12,000
I'm no no no no I'm afraid

1012
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:18,260
Rockin' man, burnin' like a seas of air

1013
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:27,660
And I think it's gonna be long, long, long

1014
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:31,300
Just long, rings me when I get too fine

1015
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,540
I'm not long, man, I think I am at home

1016
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:37,620
I'm no no no no no no

1017
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:40,580
I'm not afraid

1018
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:46,100
Rockin' man, burnin' like a seas of air

1019
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:53,820
And I think it's gonna be long, long, long, tight

1020
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,800
And I think it's gonna be a long, long, long, tight

1021
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:07,800
And I think it's gonna be a long long time

1022
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,800
And I think it's gonna be a long long time

1023
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,800
And I think it's gonna be a long long time

1024
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,800
And I think it's gonna be a long long time

1025
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,800
And I think it's gonna be a long long time

1026
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,800
Hell, John is the rocket man

1027
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,800
Of course, written by Bernie Toppin, which

1028
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,800
Like the make mention of the fact that Bernie was in Austin

1029
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,800
But Bernie here me

1030
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,800
Bernie was in Austin the other day

1031
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,800
He's on tour for his art that he does

1032
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,800
He does paintings

1033
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,800
And we were invited to the opening show with the gallery

1034
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,800
And it was kind of interesting

1035
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,800
Of course, I'm a big, big fan of all of the

1036
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,800
Elton John, Bernie Toppin collaborations

1037
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,800
And strings and I mean, even Crocodile Rock is one of my favorites

1038
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,800
I'll be a fan of him

1039
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,800
But I think I first started listening to Elton John

1040
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,800
With the blue moves album

1041
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,800
And I'll just tell you how it was

1042
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,800
Kind of interesting this Mickey and I went

1043
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,800
And he has a typical art promoter

1044
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,800
Nice lady from Los Angeles

1045
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,800
I guess she would have a gallery now

1046
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,800
She goes on tour with Bernie

1047
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,800
Looking at his art, a lot of abstract stuff

1048
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,800
Kind of like who's afraid of red yellow and blue stuff

1049
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,800
And boxes and a little laundry and kind of vibe

1050
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,800
He also, I think he wants to be a cowboy

1051
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,800
I know he lives in a ranch somewhere in southern California

1052
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:54,800
And he had a couple of nice kind of Texas star

1053
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,800
Pieces of art, you know, with lots of oil paint on it

1054
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,800
I kind of liked it actually until I saw there was $18,000

1055
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:03,800
Didn't like it that much

1056
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,800
But she was very nice, they're all coming to me

1057
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,800
Bernie who was probably five, four

1058
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,800
So there's Miss Mickey and I like, hey, how you doing?

1059
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,800
He was like, oh, I had to be so tall

1060
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:14,800
You know, he took pictures kind of bending down

1061
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,800
And then we were introduced to his wife who was six feet tall

1062
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,800
And so he was walking hot by the way, wife number four for Bernie

1063
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,800
But that's okay

1064
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,800
Very, very, very kind, very nice

1065
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,800
And when I was at least able to tell him I kind of did a fan boy thing

1066
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,800
On him and said, you know, I really like your art

1067
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,800
Which was kind of like a fib

1068
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,800
It's okay

1069
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,800
Not supersonic, but if you're a collector, you know, of course

1070
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,800
If you got the dough, you'd love to have something from Bernie top and why not

1071
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,800
But man, in the car I was going to go over over his discography

1072
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,800
Just in case, I think that was like a year and a half or two years

1073
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,800
They didn't work together

1074
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,800
But just in case, you know, we would get to talking about music

1075
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,800
Which of course didn't happen, you can't really expect that to happen

1076
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,800
At one of these occasions

1077
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,800
I have to look at the song list like, oh my god

1078
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,800
And I think the way it works is Bernie writes the lyrics

1079
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,800
And then he literally emails them to Elton

1080
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,800
He probably sent them by pigeon carrier back in the day

1081
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,800
And then Elton writes the music to it

1082
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,800
So the stuff that comes out of Bernie top is brain is quite amazing

1083
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,800
I must say

1084
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,800
And of course, we'd like to always play something a little different on the daily source code

1085
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,800
We'd like to bring out the tracks that from songs you know

1086
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,800
But usually stuff you never hear on the radio

1087
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,800
Now, of course, you've heard rock and man many times

1088
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:42,800
Another great moon song would be a marvelous night for a moon dance fan

1089
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,800
I happen to have a nice live version for you

1090
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,800
So the sound of the praises that flow

1091
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,800
And I'm trying to twist to the calling of you

1092
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,800
High strings that place of them low

1093
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,800
Well, and I expect it seems to whisper

1094
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,800
Well, that's so fun, that seems to shine

1095
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,800
And you're blessed

1096
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:37,800
And I just hope a moon dance with you

1097
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,800
I don't know

1098
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,800
Can I do the mix of a moon dance with you

1099
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,800
I don't know

1100
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,800
Well, I want a big love to you tonight

1101
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,800
I can't wait till I'm all in this car

1102
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,800
And I know now the time it is just right

1103
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,800
It's great and tomorrow you will run

1104
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,800
Oh, when you come, my heart will be waiting

1105
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,800
To make sure that you're never alone

1106
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,800
Well, and then all my dreams will come true

1107
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:16,800
They're round and I will make you my own

1108
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,800
Have a try

1109
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,800
And I touch you, you just

1110
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,800
But it's under

1111
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,800
Who wants someone to

1112
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,800
Well, that I can't hide

1113
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,800
And I just hope a moon dance with you

1114
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,800
I don't know

1115
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,800
Can I do the mix of a moon dance with you

1116
01:20:54,800 --> 01:21:07,800
You just hope a moon dance with you

1117
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,800
You just hope a moon dance with you

1118
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,800
And all my dreams will come true

1119
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,800
It's great and tomorrow you will run

1120
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,000
All of us, all of us, all of us

1121
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1122
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1123
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1124
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1125
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1126
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1127
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1128
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1129
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1130
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1131
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1132
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1133
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1134
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1135
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,800
All of us, and all of us, all of us

1136
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1137
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:04,800
All of us, all of us, all of us

1138
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:20,240
And I'll bet it's fantastic, he comes through awesome, I will definitely go take a look.

1139
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:24,880
What a marvelous night for a mood dance, and this I believe is one of those tracks that

1140
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:29,840
was used for the movie paper, Moonwood starred Jodie Foster when she was young.

1141
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:05,360
But it wouldn't be made to leave if you'd be leaving me without your love.

1142
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:13,680
It's a hunky, it's on parade without your love.

1143
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,960
It's a melody played in a penny arcade.

1144
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:27,280
It's a barn and then barely word, just as pony as it can be.

1145
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:34,640
But it wouldn't be made to leave if you'd be leaving me.

1146
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,000
Say it's on the paper, Moonwood.

1147
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,320
But we'll be sailing over a cardboard sea.

1148
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,800
But it wouldn't be made to leave.

1149
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,680
If you'd be leaving me.

1150
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,840
But it wouldn't be made to leave if you'd be leaving me.

1151
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,040
Yes, it's only a canvas cut.

1152
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:02,320
But it wouldn't be made to leave.

1153
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:08,320
But it wouldn't be made to leave if you'd be leaving me.

1154
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,760
Without your love.

1155
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:21,120
It's a hunky, it's on parade without your love.

1156
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:26,480
It's a melody played in a penny arcade.

1157
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:34,880
It's a barn and then barely word, just as pony as it can be.

1158
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:42,240
But it wouldn't be made to leave if you'd be leaving me.

1159
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:48,480
It's funny, it's plain to see.

1160
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:57,040
I have me, I would be if you'd be leaving me.

1161
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:00,080
Of course, it's Ella with the Mills Brothers.

1162
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,760
It's only a paper, Moon.

1163
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,480
And I will thank you very much, Marcus Cos, once again,

1164
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,800
couch, once again, for sending that to me.

1165
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,440
I'm going to take that to our miss-making eye.

1166
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:12,880
I don't know if you know that we have been taking dance lessons

1167
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,280
for about four and a half, maybe five months now.

1168
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,880
We initially started because we wanted to do a dance,

1169
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,320
an entire choreographed number at our wedding,

1170
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,720
which was actually intended for Christina,

1171
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,280
of course, didn't make it because of her passport,

1172
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,280
woes, or issues.

1173
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:35,600
And it was to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,

1174
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:42,240
the pure imagination, name of the song.

1175
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,840
I actually did a little edit of the song,

1176
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,480
and we had dips and swirls and swings,

1177
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,280
and we literally studied for three months.

1178
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,680
And it turned out pretty good.

1179
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,120
There is video of it.

1180
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,000
And we were actually quite, people could not believe

1181
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:56,960
that we were dancing like that.

1182
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,720
We've always called each other kind of,

1183
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,080
like, hey, we would be great ginger-rodgers for a to-stair.

1184
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,800
And I would love to learn how to dance with this song,

1185
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,480
with her, so I'm going to ask a Christina,

1186
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:10,880
our dance instructor at Uptown Dance in Austin,

1187
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,960
to help us, but first, right at where now

1188
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,560
we're studying the Texas Two Step,

1189
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,880
which by itself has a whole bunch of challenges.

1190
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,800
I'm telling you, that's us complicated, quick, quick slow.

1191
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:26,400
So this is fun, so this is holiday,

1192
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:31,520
but this is where we saved our month for all year.

1193
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:37,120
This is the sun, this is a good, good life.

1194
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,280
This is where everybody wants to be,

1195
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,560
you it out their ways.

1196
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:48,480
This is where I won't be flying.

1197
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:54,480
I'll be singing a moon on a moon.

1198
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,360
Hallelujah.

1199
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,080
I really got it made.

1200
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,320
I got two cars on the driveway,

1201
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,280
ready to take me anywhere.

1202
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,840
Glory, glory.

1203
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,720
Ooh, what a beautiful place.

1204
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:13,520
All the water and the mountains.

1205
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,240
All the people look the same.

1206
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:22,000
This is where I won't be flying.

1207
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,440
I'll be singing a moon on a moon.

1208
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:34,240
I'll be singing a moon on a moon.

1209
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:37,920
He's only being submitted.

1210
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,160
My heart hits like a drum.

1211
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,880
I'm ready to leave this credit.

1212
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,600
If I can find you here,

1213
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,400
I look down every corner,

1214
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,960
every leaf out, around.

1215
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:58,080
Stop my engines, I got only this time.

1216
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,800
I've been west, I've been losing.

1217
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,600
I travel everywhere to find my news,

1218
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:08,800
but only this I found it wasn't my news.

1219
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,520
I woke up at the soon.

1220
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,400
I lost everything before I reached the moon.

1221
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:19,680
Now I'll still try and get them over you.

1222
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:25,040
And I know where I'll be flying.

1223
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,000
I go everywhere,

1224
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Ooh, what a beautiful place.

1225
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:39,840
All the water and the mountains.

1226
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:49,840
All the water and the mountains.

1227
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:53,840
All the water and the mountains.

1228
01:28:53,840 --> 01:29:23,840
My heart beats on the moon, I've played that many times on daily source code, but well, there you go, it's very appropriate for me, so I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my

1229
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:53,840
best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm able to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm gonna do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to be able to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to decir my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm just going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm just going to do my best, I'm just going to do my best, I'm going to do my best, I'm just going to do

1230
01:29:53,840 --> 01:30:00,840
And the song that I sing is a moonlight

1231
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:06,840
I stand and I wait

1232
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,840
For the touch of your hand

1233
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,840
In the June night

1234
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:20,840
The roses are sung

1235
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,840
A moonlight serenade

1236
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,840
The stars are glow

1237
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:43,840
And tonight how their light sets me dreaming

1238
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,840
My love

1239
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,840
Do you know

1240
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:57,840
That your eyes are like stars brightly beaming

1241
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,840
I bring you

1242
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,840
And I sing you

1243
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:13,840
A moonlight serenade

1244
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,840
Let us trade till break of day

1245
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:27,840
In love's valley of dreams

1246
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,840
Just you and I

1247
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,840
A summer sky

1248
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:39,840
I have any breeze

1249
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,840
Kissing the trees

1250
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,840
It's so dumb

1251
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,840
To let me wait

1252
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:54,840
Come to me tenderly

1253
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,840
In the June night

1254
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,840
I stand

1255
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,840
Not your game

1256
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,840
And I sing you a song

1257
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,840
In the moonlight

1258
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,840
A moonlight serenade

1259
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,840
My darling

1260
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,840
I am moonlight

1261
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,840
Serenade

1262
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,840
Or as Bobby hadn't we say a fleshlight serenade

1263
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,840
No blue eyes

1264
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,840
On the charlie

1265
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,840
Absolutely lovely

1266
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,840
By the way these songs have been put together by the one-only Margarce couch

1267
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,840
You know the guy that kind of likes to rock out a lot

1268
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,840
That's what you want to visit as well

1269
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:53,840
Can you believe me?

1270
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:55,840
Love it

1271
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,840
Till the sun goes down

1272
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,840
I don't need the starlight starlight

1273
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,840
There's a magical feeling

1274
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,840
So I

1275
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,840
Him and steal your heart to die

1276
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:30,840
You can rock

1277
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,840
Just a heart

1278
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,840
But you know what you know that you

1279
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,840
Can't find the moon

1280
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:40,840
I see

1281
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:41,840
And I'm done

1282
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:42,840
You're so random

1283
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:46,840
But you know what you know that you

1284
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:48,840
Can't find the moon

1285
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:50,840
I know

1286
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,840
You can't find it

1287
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,840
It's gonna get to your heart

1288
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,840
There's no escape from love

1289
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,840
Was it true?

1290
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,840
We've just been upon a heart

1291
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,840
No matter what you think

1292
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,840
It won't be too long

1293
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,840
So you're in my arms

1294
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:20,840
I don't need the starlight starlight

1295
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,840
We'll be losing the rhythm

1296
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:26,840
So I

1297
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,840
Feel it steal your heart to die

1298
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,840
You can try

1299
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,840
Just a heart from right here

1300
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,840
But you know what you know that you

1301
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,840
Can't find the moon

1302
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:41,840
I see

1303
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:42,840
And I'm done

1304
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:43,840
You're so random

1305
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:49,840
But you know what you know that you can't find the moon

1306
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:54,840
You can't find it

1307
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:56,840
No

1308
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,840
But you know what you do

1309
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,840
Can't find it's gonna get to your heart

1310
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:07,840
There's no escape from love

1311
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:09,840
Was it true?

1312
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,840
We've just been upon a heart

1313
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,840
But you know what you know that you know that you can't find the moon

1314
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:18,840
I see

1315
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,840
And I'm done

1316
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:23,840
You're so random

1317
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,840
But you know what you do

1318
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,840
Can't find it's gonna get to your heart

1319
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,840
Just a heart from right here

1320
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,840

1396
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:45,880
go pee because misnicky is definitely laying on the the rooskees here and thank

1397
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:50,840
you Mike Marlott Malaro from Austin Texas I don't know if he's listening but

1398
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:56,560
he left the fireman number fireman's number four beers which is who makes

1399
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:03,520
this actually let me see if I can find out who makes it is a local beer brewing

1400
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:09,920
company yeah Blanco Texas is good man it's nice and smooth but of course you

1401
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:14,480
only the middle man when it comes to beer right so I have to tell you another

1402
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:20,920
story though so of course this entire episode is instigated by the the

1403
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:27,040
moon truth in episode of this week in technology but I had to do and I told

1404
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:31,680
you earlier in the show I really Mickey it suggested to me that I do a

1405
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:37,280
daily source cook because I had a mental issue the last week of our hot

1406
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:40,560
pockets tour and it started I'd remember very clearly where it started in

1407
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:50,400
Moab on our way to back I think to we come from Salt Lake City going to

1408
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:54,400
Moab then we go on to New Mexico and you know when we would pull up into

1409
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:58,920
campground mismicky would do everything on the inside and I you know park the

1410
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:03,320
car sometimes it have to unhitch it set the stabilizers you know hook up the

1411
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:09,040
poop tube hook up all the electricity the water etc and at this point I think I

1412
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:14,720
was emotionally not really emotionally but mentally drained not it's not the

1413
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:19,480
driving or anything like that but that's a it's a part of it's a part of a

1414
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:23,920
combination but also just meeting people and being with people continuously you

1415
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:28,800
know I think it's pretty well known I'm kind of a loner I like hanging out

1416
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:32,800
with Miss Mickey and sitting on the porch and do my work as a government

1417
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:38,960
legislation analyst for no agenda but I I got into this weird thing I

1418
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:44,400
actually I think I did mention it on maybe I mentioned it on no agenda my brain went

1419
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:52,200
into a loop and I would catch myself literally singing snippets from songs or

1420
01:44:52,200 --> 01:45:01,200
worst jingles like devorex slash or devorex dot or slash in a or dosy

1421
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:04,920
notes and mayorsy notes and little lambsy divesy I mean that's a horrible one

1422
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:08,960
to have stuck in your head you know that loop but I couldn't it was I wouldn't

1423
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:12,240
recognize until be going on for like half an hour and it's mainly because I'm

1424
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:17,280
hooking stuff up and and normally at night when I'm in bed or in the morning

1425
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:20,400
when I wake up I usually just let my brain kind of flow and I'm thinking about

1426
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:25,200
things I just kind of wait to see what comes through and I would keep getting

1427
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:29,480
these freaking loops in my head and I know if it's a part of just the pure

1428
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:35,800
exhaustion that we had on the tour at that in combination with my OCD slash

1429
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:42,080
Tourette or whatever it was but it was quite annoying and I really had a

1430
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:45,280
hard time stopping it I have to really the only way to stop it would be to

1431
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:49,840
think of a different song and Miss Mickey said I think quite correctly

1432
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:53,440
you just gonna play some tunes on the daily source code that'll help you out

1433
01:45:53,440 --> 01:46:03,440
and I have to say it's absolutely healthy I never heard this song but it's

1434
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:09,360
about roses and moonlight so it fits in the show it's Cheryl Crowe I like the

1435
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:15,000
tune by and way I hope you enjoyed as well on the source code 866 of the

1445
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:42,200
I don't know, Cheryl Crow's weird, man.

1446
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:49,360
I met her, I'm going to say 1987, maybe 1988, I interviewed her.

1447
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:55,160
She was a backup singer for Michael Jackson on tour, crazy hair and it was really, really

1448
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:56,160
sweet.

1449
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:59,960
I wish I could find that interview because I remember quite simply, you're like, we're

1450
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:04,360
there to interview Michael Jackson, you're right, like that's going to happen.

1451
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:10,120
Yeah, so of course, they, well, you know, Mike has come on, oh, shoot me, I already left.

1452
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:14,880
And we got one of the background singers for you, and she was very, very, very

1453
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:15,880
sweet.

1454
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:20,320
And she was like, you know, like, so, um, would you like to let get out in front of

1455
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:21,320
yourself one day?

1456
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:22,320
Oh, yeah.

1457
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,320
I'd love that.

1458
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:24,320
Well, there you go.

1459
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:25,320
She did it.

1460
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:27,320
So good on her.

1461
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:33,520
Nice conversation in the chat room, no agenda stream.com, no agenda chat.net.

1462
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:41,720
Well, the artwork created by yellow, yellow jacket, I guess, and he's done a fantastic

1463
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:42,720
job.

1464
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:48,240
You'll see you, of course, in the, in your player or on the, what do we do in, uh, it'll

1465
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:56,720
be, uh, DSC86.curry.com, um, about the, I think it's a JVC boom box.

1466
01:53:56,720 --> 01:54:02,320
Wow, that brought back memories, huh, and what kind of cassette tape you had to have, you

1467
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:05,960
know, was it the, uh, you had the metal tapes, I never liked the metal tapes.

1468
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:09,880
Well, then you could, if you had the metal tape and you had Dolby on, then it sounded

1469
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:10,880
okay.

1470
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,760
But otherwise, it had a little bit too, I don't know, just had too much going on there.

1471
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,320
I kind of like the older crappy tapes.

1472
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,160
And by the way, yellow, there is, you do have time.

1473
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:23,760
If you still want to put, uh, because I see Bobby's sitting there in the, uh, was that

1474
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:29,360
like, uh, the, the, the moon rover or something or the, the, the, the moon buggy.

1475
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:33,200
If you want to put her in a spacesuit, you know, there's still time, um, I still have some

1476
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,800
songs left.

1477
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:41,360
Some shit that'll take you back though, if you're old enough, like this one, Jim Morrison

1478
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:42,360
in the doors.

1479
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:58,440
Let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's climb to the time.

1480
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:13,440
Let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the

1481
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:17,440
moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait

1482
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:23,440

1483
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:38,440
out to the time, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's climb to the time.

1484
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:53,440
Let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the

1485
01:55:53,440 --> 01:56:08,440
moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the

1486
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:20,440
moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the

1487
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:36,440
moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's climb to the time,

1488
01:56:36,440 --> 01:57:06,440
uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let

1489
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:36,440
the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out, let's wait, let's wait out, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, let's wait, let's wait out, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait out to the moon, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait out to the moon, uh-huh, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait out to the moon, let's wait out to the moon, let us wait, let's wait, let's wait out to the moon, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait for a little 날 show, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait, oh she's like busted, yeah, oh she's like gotta get

1490
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:40,520
from Camp Mofo here in the capital of the drone star state.

1491
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:43,800
Notice Austin Texas since she's been so kind to hang out

1492
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:44,960
and entertain us on the child room.

1493
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,720
I think I should play a song from Ms. Bobby Eden.

1494
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:49,680
I know this is one of her favorite bands.

1495
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:54,360
And it actually turns out it was the first band on the moon.

1496
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:55,920
Yes.

1497
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:58,680
If you don't know who it is, all you have to do is just close your eyes

1498
01:57:58,680 --> 01:57:59,760
and listen to that bass line.

1499
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:03,000
You know it's gotta be the one and only Nikki six playing it for you.

1500
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,520
Yes, I'm the source code.

1501
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:07,000
This is Bully.

1502
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Cool.

1503
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Oh.

1504
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Oh.

1505
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Oh.

1506
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Oh.

1507
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Oh.

1508
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Oh.

1509
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Oh.

1510
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Oh.

1511
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Oh.

1512
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:20,280
There's a problem with the girls here on the stage.

1513
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:22,560
Now, they're getting over the knees.

1514
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:23,560
They're getting over the knees.

1515
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:25,080
So, they seem to look everything well.

1516
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:26,760
So, they seem to be a star.

1517
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:29,040
God, give a frame off the narrow.

1518
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:30,040
How it's played.

1519
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:31,040
Oh.

1520
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:32,040
Oh.

1521
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:33,040
Oh.

1522
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:34,040
Oh.

1523
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:34,920
Oh.

1524
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:35,640
Oh.

1525
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:36,520
Oh.

1526
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:37,520
Oh.

1527
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:38,560
Oh.

1528
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,560
Oh.

1529
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:42,360
Oh.

1530
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:46,360
I'm just a girl band and my own brains are the tears

1531
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:48,360
Just a mention, how I go

1532
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:50,360
Loving space

1533
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:55,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1534
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:58,360
He can't come to suit me

1535
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:02,360
Someone always has to break the rules

1536
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:08,360
Like a rock, it won't come to the first man down the road

1537
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:12,360
So never wanna think too loud

1538
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:15,360
So we can't just think about souls

1539
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:20,360
Even if we're out of tune, we're doomed all alone

1540
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:34,360
Everybody wants to know that give me a sense

1541
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:37,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1542
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:40,360
He can't come to suit me

1543
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:43,360
Someone always has to break the rules

1544
01:59:43,360 --> 02:00:02,360
Like a rock, it won't come to the first man down the road

1545
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:09,360
So we can't just think about souls

1546
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:15,360
Even if we're out of tune, we're doomed all alone

1547
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:35,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1548
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:34,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, how, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1549
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:36,360
We didn't need for that.

1550
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:40,360
I still want to first pass down the road.

1551
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:52,360
We didn't need for that to first pass down the road.

1552
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:07,360
And I'm curious.

1553
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,360
You see, I know you're not real man.

1554
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:13,360
Because I'm loaded, okay.

1555
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,360
I've had some experience in that area.

1556
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:17,360
Besides, that whole route for yours is full anyway.

1557
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:18,360
Good.

1558
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:19,360
You've let's all the same crap.

1559
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:21,360
Rock and roll is the only thing that counts.

1560
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:25,360
Dig, hard, ass, blistering, awesome, heavy metal.

1561
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:27,360
Rock and roll.

1562
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:29,360
You'll see.

1563
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:36,360
You'll see.

1564
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:45,360
It's just for yourself, for me,

1565
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:50,360
and this whole crambody.

1566
02:02:57,360 --> 02:03:00,360
And I'm got to chill, too.

1567
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:03,360
You'll see.

1568
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:07,360
You'll hear the harmony,

1569
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:10,360
and harmony.

1570
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:14,360
And we'll be on,

1571
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:19,360
and we'll be here one hour,

1572
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:23,360
and we'll be here one hour,

1573
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:27,360
one hour,

1574
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,360
one day a day a day a day.

1575
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:33,360
So I felt it

1576
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:49,360
If you don't talk to the crowd, you're distracted by the sound

1577
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:54,360
I'm standing out, I'm just splashing above you

1578
02:03:54,360 --> 02:04:01,360
But don't be afraid of me

1579
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:05,360
Cause I wanna hurt you at all

1580
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:11,360
And I was waiting to catch you to catch you

1581
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:15,360
And they'll be on me

1582
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:19,360
And they'll be on me

1583
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:26,360
And they'll be on me

1584
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:28,360
And they'll be on me

1585
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:37,360
So I'm standing out, I'm just splashing above you

1586
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:41,360
And they'll be on me

1587
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:46,360
And they'll be on me

So I'm standing out, I'm just splashing above you

1590
02:04:56,360 --> 02:05:00,360
So I'm standing out, I'm just splashing above you

1591
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:05,360
And they'll be on me

1592

1599
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:49,360
So I'm standing out, I'm just splashing above you

1600
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:57,360
So I'm standing out, I'm just splashing above you

1601
02:05:57,360 --> 02:06:08,360
So I'm standing out, I'm just splashing above you

1602
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:10,360
We're still on the ground.

1603
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:12,360
We're still on the ground.

1604
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:14,360
We're still on the ground.

1605
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:16,360
We're still on the ground.

1606
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:18,360
We're still on the ground.

1607
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:20,360
We're still on the ground.

1608
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:22,360
Damn, I'll tell you, man.

1609
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:24,360
We're still on the ground.

1610
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:26,360
It's only I had walking talking's back in the day.

1611
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:28,360
My show would have been so much better.

1612
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:29,360
Cage 9.

1613
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:32,360
Beyond the Daily Source Code episode 866.

1614
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:34,360
This is the Lunar Edition.

1615
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:35,360
No gravity.

1616
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:36,360
No.

1617
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:37,360
No.

1618
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:39,360
Although maybe there's just a little bit.

1619
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:43,360
Yeah, that's why those guys bounce around so much in the studio or whatever.

1620
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:46,360
All right, we're winding it down.

1621
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:49,360
Although I still see about 10 songs left in the box.

1622
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:50,360
Good to go.

1623
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:52,360
Wait for the artwork when it's done.

1624
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:53,360
We'll wind it up.

1625
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:54,360
That's how it works.

1626
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:55,360
So easy D.C.

1627
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:57,360
I'm the charcoal Charlie Hill.

1628
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:58,360
Right.

1629
02:06:58,360 --> 02:06:59,360
Time out.

1630
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:00,360
They went to the railroad.

1631
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:01,360
Time out.

1632
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:03,360
Down the line.

1633
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:05,360
Give it back.

1634
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:07,360
Roll with just a one-note chance.

1635
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:10,360
Give it to the one-note time.

1636
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:13,360
That you do wish it was home in bed.

1637
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:14,360
I'll do my best.

1638
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:15,360
I'll do my best.

1639
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:16,360
I'll do my best.

1640
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:17,360
I'll do my best.

1641
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:20,360
But I won't have a mind ahead.

1642
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:22,360
Think of our problem.

1643
02:07:22,360 --> 02:07:25,360
I wasn't sure love that I won't.

1644
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:28,360
It's your love that I need.

1645
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:31,360
It's your love that I've got to help.

1646
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:34,360
It's your love.

1647
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:37,360
Everybody back, cross the sky.

1648
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:40,360
It's what the hell was that I told.

1649
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:44,360
But now, running down and chill your chill.

1650
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:46,360
Go to the snow and down.

1651
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:50,360
Drop the snow and look at the old free ride.

1652
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:51,360
Think of our love as long as it's a bird.

1653
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:52,360
It's a bird.

1654
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:53,360
It's a bird.

1655
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:55,360
It's a bird.

1656
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:56,360
It's a bird.

1657
02:07:56,360 --> 02:07:57,360
It's a bird.

1658
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,360
It's a bird.

1659
02:07:58,360 --> 02:07:59,360
It's a bird.

1660
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:00,360
It's a bird.

1661
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:01,360
It's a bird.

1662
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:02,360
It's a bird.

1663
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:03,360
It's a bird.

1664
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:04,360
It's a bird.

1665
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:06,360
It's a bird.

1666
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:07,360
It's a bird.

1667
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:08,360
It's a bird.

1668
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:09,360
It's a bird.

1669
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:10,360
It's a bird.

1670
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:11,360
It's a bird.

1671
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:12,360
It's a bird.

1672
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:13,360
It's a bird.

1673
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:15,360
It's a bird.

1674
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,360
It's a bird.

1675
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:17,360
It's a bird.

1676
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:18,360
It's a bird.

1677
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:19,360
It's a bird.

1678
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:21,360
It's a bird.

1679
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:24,360
It's a bird which I should take care of.

1680
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:25,360
To get a map of this ship.

1681
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:26,360
To get a map of this ship.

1682
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:27,360
It's a bird.

1683
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:29,360
To get a map of this ship.

1684
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:30,320
It's a bird.

1685
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:03,820
I didn't mean to hurt that woman in my life

1686
02:09:03,820 --> 02:09:08,320
It was a heart attack, it's a love that I want

1687
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:12,320
It's a love that I need

1688
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:15,320
It's a love that I have

1689
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:22,320
It's a love that I don't want

1690
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:25,320
It's a love that I need

1691
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:28,320
It's a love that I have

1692
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:31,320
It's a love

1693
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:34,320
What's next to the moon?

1694
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:46,320
The moon is star

1695
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:49,320
Hello there, my friends in the long cabin

1696
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:51,320
In tens of minutes you rocking out yet

1697
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:56,320
Amazing, now you can go on in this country

1698
02:09:56,320 --> 02:10:03,160
It was just one topic and boy does the moon have a lot going forth in C.G.C.

1699
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:08,160
What's mentioned the moon in the daily store's code 866 and I do have a couple of my own

1700
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:13,360
selection that I thought about in the car like being on the phone.

1701
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:15,560
Yeah, remember that?

1702
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:19,240
Whatever happened to them, I love these guys as we're such a great song.

1703
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:23,240
The whole of the moon, the water voice and source code 866.

1704
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:40,480
I've pictured a rainbow, you held it in your hands, I had flashes, you saw the plan,

1705
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:51,480
I wandered out in the world for years, but you just stayed in your room, I saw the

1706
02:10:51,480 --> 02:11:08,380
present, you saw the whole of the moon, the whole of the moon, you held it in the

1707
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:15,560
turnstels for the wind and your heels, you spetched all the stars and you know how it

1708
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:32,560
feels to reach too high, too far, too soon, you saw the whole of the moon, I was granted

1709
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:46,320
where you filled the skies, I was dumbfounded by truth, you cut too late, I saw the ring dirty

1710
02:11:46,320 --> 02:12:11,360
valley, you saw the ringer do, I saw the present, you saw the whole of the moon,

1711
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:27,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1712
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:42,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1713
02:12:42,440 --> 02:12:52,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1714
02:12:52,440 --> 02:13:06,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1715
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:12,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1716
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:17,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1717
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:32,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1718
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:38,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1719
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:44,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1720
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:59,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1721
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:11,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1722
02:14:11,440 --> 02:14:25,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1723
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:29,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1724
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:38,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do,

1725
02:14:38,440 --> 02:15:08,440
I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ring

1726
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:38,440
do, I saw the ringer does, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringel do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do, I saw the ringer do

1727
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:43,440
The trees and the speckling

1728
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:46,440
Carrying a red fire moon light

1729
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:49,440
Shadows sing a song from the wind

1730
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:53,440
Carrying a red fire moon light

1731
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:54,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1732
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:57,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1733
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:59,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1734
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:01,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1735
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:03,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1736
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:05,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1737
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:06,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1738
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:17,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1739
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:19,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1740
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:23,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1741
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:27,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1742
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:31,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1743
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:35,440
Shadows sing a red fire moon light

1744
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:39,440
Carry the way, find me my shadow

1745
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:43,440
Start what's going in so very light

1746
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:46,440
Fall away on the other side

1747
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:50,440
Will you come to turn to me this nest

1748
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:54,440
That you couldn't find what I was through

1749
02:16:54,440 --> 02:17:00,440
I say, I bless you in heaven

1750
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:06,440
I bless you in heaven

1751
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:08,440
The one day

1752
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:34,440
Will you come to turn to me this nest

1753
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:38,440
That you couldn't find what I was through

1754
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:43,440
I say, I bless you in heaven

1755
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:46,440
I bless you in heaven

1756
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:48,440
The one day

1757
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:51,440
Will you come to turn to me this nest

1758
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:53,440
That you couldn't find what I was through

1759
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:55,440
I say, I bless you in heaven

1760
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:57,440
The one day

1761
02:17:57,440 --> 02:18:00,440
Will you come to turn to me this nest

1762
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:05,440
That you couldn't find what I was through

1763
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:11,440
I say, I bless you in heaven

1764
02:18:11,440 --> 02:18:15,440
The one day

1765
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:17,440
Will you come to turn to me this nest

1766
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:21,440
That you couldn't find what I was through

1767
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:29,280
field, vocally assisted by Maggie Riley, I think, was her name. Irish girl, girl,

1768
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:36,560
you know. And you know, by the way, I got a voicemail from Bobby early this week. And

1769
02:18:36,560 --> 02:18:40,880
you know, she wants to, I think, she wants to live in the United States full-time. And

1770
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:46,160
she's working on her paperwork. I think she's actually getting, getting an O1, which is

1771
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:52,880
for exceptional talent in the arts, which no one can disagree with, obviously. But she

1772
02:18:52,880 --> 02:19:00,720
may need a few resumes, you know, to convince Lucy Napolitano that she's legit. So if that

1773
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:06,480
were to be the case, I'm sure that we can arrange a couple hundred from the Debbie Source Code

1774
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:11,760
list. I'm sure you guys would be more than happy to help out, right? Hey, if we're doing a full-on

1775
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:16,400
lunar edition, we just can't miss one of my favorite categories of music. And that, of course,

1776
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:19,760
would be country. And if you're going to talk about country, you might as well get this crap.

1777
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:24,720
Oh crap, if you, he will edit that. If you're going to talk about country, you might as well get

1778
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:32,320
the two top guys in the business. Here we go. Go. Yeah, can't win them all, I guess.

1779
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:41,280
I'll talk to my books and done, of course. Me on moon. When the sun goes down on my side of

1780
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:59,040
town, then no sun feeling comes to my door over a time. Blue. There's a run-bound bar across the

1781
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:11,520
railroad park. I got a table or two, way back where I said no, thank goodness you.

1782
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:21,600
I spent most of it night beneath the light of a neon moon.

1783
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:32,800
Now if you lose your heart, it's lonely, it's always to be far, lonely.

1784
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:41,600
Don't watch your broken dreams dancing out of the beans, ever neon moon.

1785
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:54,480
I think the two young lovers are running wild and free. I've lost my nose and sometimes see you settle.

1786
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:05,840
But it's not for you, Rose. Don't tell me how many tears I've said here, Rose.

1787
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:12,880
I'll have many lives that I've lied to in my heart.

1788
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:27,040
See you come back someday. Oh, but I'll be all right. As long as there's light for my neon moon.

1789
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:38,240
Oh, if you lose your heart, it's lonely, it's always to be far, lonely.

1790
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:46,560
Don't watch your broken dreams dancing out of the beans, ever neon moon.

1791
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:14,880
If you'd buy to play it's home, bring back, and the words that I've never said, songs in the

1792
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:32,880
same way. And it's heard inside. They never got me. Oh, but I'll be all right. As long as there's light for my neon moon.

1793
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:44,080
Oh, if you lose your heart, it's lonely, it's always to be far, lonely.

1794
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:52,880
Don't watch your broken dreams dancing out of the beans, ever neon moon.

1795
02:22:52,880 --> 02:23:02,880
Watch your broken dreams dancing out of the beans, ever neon moon.

1796
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:14,880
Watch your broken dreams dancing out of the beans, ever neon moon.

1797
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:29,600
Yeah, they are kind of the go-to guys. If you look for something like the country genre,

1798
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:35,840
Brooks, and Dunn, although I don't see him win too many words anymore on the country music awards.

1799
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:39,840
All right, add two more songs. Let's just stay kind of in this vibe for a second. One more,

1800
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:44,320
it's all lunar edition. Send me the moon. Sarah Burrell is on the Charlie.

1801
02:23:53,840 --> 02:24:01,280
To live on all with a pieces and parts of me left.

1802
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:08,880
Every last day seemed to carry the weight of a lifetime.

1803
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:17,920
Watch from the ground as the gold fluttered down from the sky.

1804
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:27,680
Sweet sun, send me the moon.

1805
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:45,680
Empty the skies out, bringing me one step closer to you, send it to you.

1806
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:46,640
I will wait and breathe out till you come in and out, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1807
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:34,900
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1808
02:25:34,900 --> 02:25:49,900
I'm still here, I'm sinking like standing your sea

1809
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:57,900
So it's time to send me home

1810
02:25:57,900 --> 02:26:10,900
Empty the skies out, bringing me one step closer to you

1811
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:19,900
Send it soon, I won't breathe in, breathe out

1812
02:26:19,900 --> 02:26:30,900
Till you're coming in now, call me you

1813
02:26:30,900 --> 02:26:37,900
You already do

1814
02:26:37,900 --> 02:26:51,900
Never you mind whether you look should find us together

1815
02:26:51,900 --> 02:27:00,900
Distance can take what is hidden here safe in my chest

1816
02:27:00,900 --> 02:27:08,900
Wait for the day when we finally say no, never

1817
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:14,900
Till then I'll be here wanting more as I settle for

1818
02:27:14,900 --> 02:27:26,900
At once we've switched on, send me home

1819
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:39,900
Empty the skies out, bringing me one step closer to you

1820
02:27:39,900 --> 02:27:43,900
Send it soon, I won't breathe in

1821
02:27:43,900 --> 02:27:48,900
I won't breathe in, breathe out

1822
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:54,900
Till you're coming in now, call me you

1823
02:27:54,900 --> 02:28:01,900
You already do

1824
02:28:01,900 --> 02:28:10,900
Never you mind whether you look should find us together

1825
02:28:10,900 --> 02:28:18,900
Oh man, that's such a pretty song

1826
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:21,900
You know that's about all you can hear on the road by the way

1827
02:28:21,900 --> 02:28:23,900
When you're driving around these great states of

1828
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:26,900
Communication, it's country music and sometimes you hit upon a station

1829
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:29,900
It really is playing some of these tunes, very very nice

1830
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:33,900
And just as I was about to start whining it down, I got an email from Mike D.

1831
02:28:33,900 --> 02:28:38,900
He said, dude, how can you not play King's Harvest?

1832
02:28:39,900 --> 02:28:43,900
So right, we got a dance in the moonlight baby, you and me

1833
02:28:43,900 --> 02:28:47,900
And Bobby makes three, I made a rhyme

1834
02:28:47,900 --> 02:28:53,900
But yeah, we get it almost every night

1835
02:28:53,900 --> 02:28:56,900
And when that moon gets a pain and bright

1836
02:28:56,900 --> 02:28:59,900
It's super natural that light

1837
02:28:59,900 --> 02:29:04,900
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight

1838
02:29:09,900 --> 02:29:13,900
Everybody here is outside

1839
02:29:13,900 --> 02:29:16,900
But they don't bark and they don't bite

1840
02:29:16,900 --> 02:29:20,900
They keep things loose, they keep things alive

1841
02:29:20,900 --> 02:29:25,900
Everybody with dancing in the moonlight

1842
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:27,900
Dancing in the moonlight

1843
02:29:27,900 --> 02:29:30,900
Everybody with all that freedom

1844
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:33,900
All that bright in the sunshine

1845
02:29:33,900 --> 02:29:38,900
Everybody with dancing in the moonlight

1846
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:41,900
Like a phone and we never fight

1847
02:29:41,900 --> 02:29:44,900
But you can't dance and stay up tight

1848
02:29:44,900 --> 02:29:48,900
It's super natural that light

1849
02:29:48,900 --> 02:29:53,900
Everybody with dancing in the moonlight

1850
02:29:53,900 --> 02:29:55,900
Dancing in the moonlight

1851
02:29:55,900 --> 02:29:58,900
Everybody with all that freedom

1852
02:29:58,900 --> 02:30:01,900
All that bright in the sunshine

1853
02:30:02,900 --> 02:30:08,900
Everybody with dancing in the moonlight

1854
02:30:21,900 --> 02:30:24,900
Everybody here is outside

1855
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:27,900
But they don't bark and they don't bite

1856
02:30:27,900 --> 02:30:30,900
They keep things loose, they keep things alive

1857
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:36,900
Everybody with dancing in the moonlight

1858
02:30:36,900 --> 02:30:38,900
Dancing in the moonlight

1859
02:30:38,900 --> 02:30:42,900
Everybody with feeling warm and bright

1860
02:30:42,900 --> 02:30:45,900
It's a super trough fine and natural sight

1861
02:30:45,900 --> 02:30:49,900
Everybody with dancing in the moonlight

1862
02:30:49,900 --> 02:30:56,900
Everybody with dancing in the moonlight

1863
02:30:56,900 --> 02:30:59,900
Everybody with feeling warm and bright

1864
02:30:59,900 --> 02:31:06,900
Everybody's excited, oh you're like a footballer dancing in the moonlight

1865
02:31:06,900 --> 02:31:13,900
Everybody's feeling, oh, I'm blind, so don't find them after sight

1866
02:31:13,900 --> 02:31:19,900
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight, everybody's feeling, oh I'm blind

1867
02:31:19,900 --> 02:31:23,900
Everybody's feeling, oh I'm blind

1868
02:31:23,900 --> 02:31:27,900
What an obvious choice, I'm so glad we got that one at the very last minute

1869
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:30,900
There we go, two hours and 33 minutes, it's a magic time to leave

1870
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:34,900
And I want to thank everyone for participating once again

1871
02:31:34,900 --> 02:31:36,900
On the live stream, no agenda stream.com

1872
02:31:36,900 --> 02:31:39,900
I think you'd get mostly for flipping the switch

1873
02:31:39,900 --> 02:31:41,900
Mr. Oil, of course

1874
02:31:41,900 --> 02:31:45,900
Thank you Bobby Eden for dropping by, beautiful to have you along

1875
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:48,900
And a yellow jacket for the artwork

1876
02:31:48,900 --> 02:31:51,900
Marcus Cowche, executive producer of all the music on your program

1877
02:31:51,900 --> 02:31:54,900
So next time we get together, I think we're doing the fire episode

1878
02:31:55,900 --> 02:32:00,900
We'll have to do that one pretty soon because that is specifically going to be produced for fire fighters

1879
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:03,900
Fighting wildfires all across a good donation

1880
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:09,900
And how could I not end the show without thanking my lovely wife, Miss Mickey

1881
02:32:09,900 --> 02:32:13,900
For prompting me, supporting me, and getting me getting my ass and gear to do the show

1882
02:32:13,900 --> 02:32:19,900
And clearing the decks in order for me to do it and supplying me with nice databases to get it done

1883
02:32:19,900 --> 02:32:23,900
So I want to leave you with a song that even your mom will love

1884
02:32:24,900 --> 02:32:27,900
Talk to you next time, charcoal heads, bye-bye

1885
02:32:54,900 --> 02:33:01,900
You're way too busy

1886
02:33:01,900 --> 02:33:09,900
I'll see the world, there's such a lot of work to see

1887
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:21,900
We're after the same

1888
02:33:22,900 --> 02:33:25,900
We're from the day

1889
02:33:25,900 --> 02:33:32,900
From my heart from the friend

1890
02:33:51,900 --> 02:33:56,900
We'll see you with stars from me

1891
02:33:56,900 --> 02:34:01,900
We'll be with you

1892
02:34:01,900 --> 02:34:05,900
We'll be with you

1893
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:12,900
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way

1894
02:34:12,900 --> 02:34:19,900
To the rivers of the city world

1895
02:34:19,900 --> 02:34:26,900
There's such a lot of work to see

1896
02:34:26,900 --> 02:34:41,900
We're after the same old man

1897
02:34:41,900 --> 02:34:48,900
My heart from the friend

1898
02:34:48,900 --> 02:34:57,900
We'll be with you

1899
02:34:57,900 --> 02:35:05,900
We'll be with you

1900
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:12,900
We'll be with you
