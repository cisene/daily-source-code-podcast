00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
Delta share Charlie eight six four. It is April 26, 2012. I am drunk. And a perfect

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,320
time to restart the daily source code. Let me just explain for a moment. I was watching

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:26,320
American Idol. And they were playing songs from Queen. And regardless of whether these people

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,680
can sing or not, the fact that they take a six minute song like Bohemian Rhapsody and cut

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:41,360
that down to a minute and 15 seconds with some douche baggets singing it hurt me so much. And

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,680
I miss Freddie Mercury so much. I miss so many people so much for the great music they gave

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,000
us that you don't hear on the radio anymore. That is not respected. That I just wrote

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,080
down a list of 10 or 12 songs. And I figured I got to play them for you.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:07,920
I was never there. You were the saddest Joe. And I did it to your goal. So if you come see me remember me

10
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:23,200
and I knew you were. You said you were bad, but I guess we were in 1991.

11
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:46,560
I'm looking for a beautiful, I'm looking for a ride, I'm looking for a body, I'm looking for a

12
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,960
side, I'm looking for the trees and that I'm going 65. Beware of the selfish Joe.

13
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:10,880
I'm looking for a ride, I'm looking for a ride, I'm looking for a ride, I'm looking for a ride,

14
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm looking for a ride, I'm looking for a ride, I'm looking for a ride,

15
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:57,240
Now, granted David Bowie is not dead, but he's so buffed as an entire capital.

16
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:23,240
And he's not made a decent song since, so that is one of the people that I really really miss and want to share with you as I go down my list here of songs and what I'm doing literally is downloading things from Amazon's MP3 as we go along and I'll put all of these in the show notes at what's at dsc864.curry.com, new show notes for the show.

17
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Just going to restart this program. I don't care if they send me to jail for playing licensed music because I just realize the future, the current state of the music industry is the voice American idol, all of these programs.

18
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:49,240
And I have to say, although I don't mind the voice because we got some good singers, they're raping the music. They're really, really raping it. It's not okay.

19
00:04:49,240 --> 00:05:01,240
We need to hear these songs. And I miss Freddie Mercury so incredibly much. I remember when I heard when he was sick, he was supposed to come on my show and do an interview and it's not going to happen.

20
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:11,240
And by the way, it's never going to have a sworn to secrecy. It wasn't about to say anything and I had to keep that secret for like a year and a half. It's horrible.

21
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:23,240
And I grew up listening to Queen and I want to play a couple of tracks from Queen. I got a lot of other stuff on my list from people. I really, really, really miss. And this is just one that you don't hear enough of anymore.

22
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,240
I want to write it where I like.

23
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:53,240
I say white, I say white, I say sharp, I say him, and yours was never my scene and I don't like Star Wars.

24
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,240
I say wrong, say right, say God give me a choice.

25
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,240
I say no, I say Christ, I don't believe in Peter, but I can stand a Superman.

26
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:23,240
I want to write my bike, I want to write my bike, I want to write my bicycle.

27
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:31,240
I'm sick of races, I'll come in your way, so forget all your days all year now.

28
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:41,240
I want to learn how to feel, be running today, so look out for those beauties all year.

29
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:51,240
I want to learn how to feel, be running today, so forget all your days all year now.

30
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:59,240
I want to learn how to feel, be running today, so forget all your days all year now.

31
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:07,240
I want to learn how to feel, be running today, so forget all your days all year now.

32
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,240
I want to learn how to feel, be running today, so forget all your days all year now.

33
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:47,240
I want to learn how to feel, be running today, so forget all your days all year now.

34
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:55,240
I want to learn how to feel, be running today, so forget all your days all year now.

35
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:03,240
I want to learn how to feel, be running today, so forget all your days all year now.

36
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:19,240
I want to learn how to feel, be running today, so forget all your days all year now.

37
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,320
was probably one of the funnest video clips never shown on American TV, a whole bunch

38
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,920
of beautiful girls riding on 10-speed bicycles completely naked.

39
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,320
Of course I was in Europe at the time that this was, actually, well, I think it was a hit

40
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:41,400
at the time, a screen with bicycle race, one more from the unbelievable, Freddie Mercury,

41
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:49,480
actually, only about six weeks after he passed, I was in Portugal, excuse me.

42
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,960
As I was doing a television show, which also was broadcast in Portugal, and Roger Taylor

43
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:02,960
and Brian May were in the same hotel that I was staying and I sat down with him, and these

44
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,560
guys were fucking destroyed, and as was everybody in the music industry, because

45
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:17,440
Freddie Mercury was such an incredible, beautiful talent, such a shy, beautiful man, and

46
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,520
I just want to honor him with one of my favorite queen songs of all time.

47
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:51,040
So it was time, it made up his mind to leave his dead life behind, his boss fractured him

48
00:09:51,040 --> 00:10:01,300
while you'd been a big kid, to get those crazy notion, right out of your hand, Freddie

49
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:14,260
Mercury, do you think that you are, you should have escaped there, I'll keep it for a while.

50
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:44,260
We're in your wings and try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away

51
00:10:44,260 --> 00:11:14,260
try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away, try away,

52
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,260
Yeah.

53
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:25,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

54
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:31,100
Since he was small, had no luck at all.

55
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,100
Nothing can be as easy as you will

56
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,100
Now it was time

57
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,100
He made up his mind

58
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,100
This could be my last chance

59
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
His arms are set to hand

60
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Now listen, boy

61
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
You're always dreaming

62
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,100
You've got no real ambition

63
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,100
You won't get away from all

64
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Every bird that you live with

65
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
You are

66
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Why can't you be happy

67
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,100
Have to have a roof off

68
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,100
To hold his friends always

69
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
And fly away

70
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Fly away

71
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Fly away

72
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
Spread your little wings

73
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Fly away

74
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Fly away

75
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Fly away

76
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
Go in and swim together

77
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,100
You know they're so stupid

78
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Let's be close your free man

79
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
Come on, girl

80
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,100
Come on, girl

81
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,100
Come on, girl

82
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Come on, girl

83
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Come on, girl

84
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
Come on, girl

85
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Come on

86
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,100
Come on, girl

87
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Come on, girl

88
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Come on, girl

89
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Come on, girl

90
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:43,100
I was singing a long, very, very loudly where that song has funny how you remember

91
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:49,580
some of these lyrics that just stick in your head, but even though I've had almost an

92
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:55,180
entire bottle of wine, as Miss Mickey and I just decided to kind of let loose. Although I kind

93
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,140
of let loose, she didn't let loose so much and I was just watching this bull crap on American

94
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,980
handle. And I got to do a daily source code. She said, go, go, go, right now, shall I pour

95
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,780
you another wine? She understands so much, doesn't she? All right, so here's another guy that

96
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,380
I miss very, very much. And this is just the theme. I have no idea what's going to happen

97
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,660
in the daily source code, but I actually, here's a little secret. I recorded a daily source code,

98
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:28,060
I recorded 864 yesterday. And it was pretty much a non-musical show. Although I did have a theme

99
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,660
about radio and I was talking about the state of podcasting. And after I was done with it, I was like,

100
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:40,700
this is done releaseable. I just don't like what I did. I like so much the vein that I was in with,

101
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,980
you know, I'd add the three hour music extra vegans is a little bit too much, just physically.

102
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,620
It's too much for me to do and you get into it. You start repeating songs very quickly

103
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,980
from week to week if you're doing three hours worth. And I really just want to go based upon

104
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,820
feeling and convey something. And I know a lot of people are waiting for a new show. So I hope that

105
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:09,580
you take this with a little grain of salt since, as I said, it's completely based upon just

106
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,580
emotions of the moment needing to just play some songs really loudly, songs that I love from

107
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,860
people that I miss. And here's a guy that I work with many, many times throughout the years in

108
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,820
Montros, Switzerland where he lived. He was on my show, many times I've interviewed him a lovely

109
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:32,460
guy his name is Robert Palmer. I'm going to play two songs for you. This one never gets played.

110
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:37,420
But it is one of his prettiest, every kind of people on the source code.

111
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:14,460
Make what lives about it. Every kind of people make the world go down.

112
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:30,860
Sometimes looking for a leap in his duty to a king or two of me, protecting what he feels is right.

113
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:40,860
Fight against one with his life. There's no profit in this seat.

114
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,860
On a smith or that revenge doesn't not disappear.

115
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:56,140
Whether he yellow black or white, each and every man's the same inside.

116
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:05,020
Who takes every kind of people to make what lives about it.

117
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:15,020
It takes every kind of people to make the world go down.

118
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:56,140
And the new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new

119
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:26,140
new, kind, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new

120
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,820
takes every kind of people. By the way, we are now streaming live at no agenda stream.com.

121
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,420
Thank you very much. I get most laid for plug-in. I hope I didn't pre-empt anybody on the stream.

122
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:44,780
But for those of you just joining us, I'm drunk, which is saying a lot for me. That's like

123
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,180
three quarters of bottle of wine and I'll just catch up to speed for those of you just joining us.

124
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,460
Those of you listening to the podcast you already know that I was watching a recorded American

125
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:02,220
Idol and they were doing Queen songs and it just made me so angry that these great artists,

126
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,460
these great songs, these great musicians who I love so much and who I miss so much,

127
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,060
being raped in a minute and 15 seconds and whether these people are talented or not,

128
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,820
it doesn't matter. I just, I, I felt like I had to play some songs really,

129
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,700
really loudly. Songs that I love, people that I love, that I miss very, very much.

130
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,500
So you missed the Queen songs if you're just joining us now, but that'll be on the podcast.

131
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:32,380
One more song by Robert Palmer, who passed away. I don't know. What is it? 9 or 10 years ago now?

132
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,180
Another one you'll never hear on the radio.

133
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,220
Dr. Dr. Give me the news.

134
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,660
Got a bad case of loving you.

135
00:19:51,660 --> 00:20:02,940
I need you to suit my head. Turn my blue heart to head.

136
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:11,980
Dr. Dr. Give me the news. I got a bad case of loving you.

137
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:19,420
No feel's gonna kill me. I got a bad case of loving you.

138
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,420
A pretty face, don't make no pretty heart.

139
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,060
I learned that, but if I'm gonna start,

140
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:48,940
you think I'm cute. A little bit shy, Mama, I ain't that kind of guy.

141
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,980
Dr. Dr. Give me the news. I got a bad case of loving you.

142
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:05,420
No feel's gonna kill me. I got a bad case of loving you.

143
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,860
Wow.

144
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,100
I know you like it. You like it all the time.

145
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:40,540
Tell me, Mama, but you don't stop.

146
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:54,140
Let me down. I'll twist my love to you.

147
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,900
Oh, it's on your lips. Shake my face.

148
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:09,660
Rock, roll. I'm got a bad bad. I'm a guy in tune.

149
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,380
Dr. Dr. Give me the news. I've got a bad case of loving you.

150
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:26,700
No feel's gonna kill me. I got a bad case of loving you.

151
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,100
Robert Palmer, Dr. Dr. Give me the news. I got a bad case of loving you.

152
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:37,180
I'm playing songs here on Daily Source Code 864 playing songs for people who have passed away.

153
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,780
Who I miss so much and you just don't hear enough of them anymore.

154
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,380
And when I hear their songs being raped on television by these fucking reality shows,

155
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,380
we need to hear a original stuff, you know?

156
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:32,380
I'm playing songs here on Daily Source Code 864 playing songs for people who have passed away.

157
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:38,300
All over the country, I've seen it the same. Nobody's wearing it.

158
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,900
I just got a game. We gotta do better. Let's try to be in it.

159
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,300
You know all the answers, let's go from it and throw it in.

160
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:56,300
Come on, it's taking three right, three right. Come on, it's taking three right.

161
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,300
Come on, it's taking three right.

162
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Come on, it's taking three right.

163
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Come on, it's taking three right.

164
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:54,300
Come on, it's taking three right. Come on, it's taking three right.

165
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:08,300
Come on, it's taking three right. Come on, it's taking three right.

166
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,300
Come on, it's taking three right. Come on, it's taking three right.

167
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:18,300
Come on, it's taking three right. Come on, it's taking three right.

168
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:26,140
Not a lot of people know that is Dan Hartman playing the fretless bass with Edgar

169
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,140
Winter.

170
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,340
Come on, take a free ride.

171
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,420
Another guy in this so much, aides to him, man.

172
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:44,060
And in 1980, I'm going to say 1984, I was invited by Dan Hartman to come to America and

173
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,100
hang out in the state of his house up in Connecticut at the time he was working with

174
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,620
a Dutch band, the time bandits with a lead just hitting, and he had a studio at home.

175
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,060
And it was just such an awesome guy.

176
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,580
He had all these crazy tapes that he would play in the middle of the night.

177
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,180
He had like unedited print tapes and he was like freaking out about how good it was.

178
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,580
And by the way, when I was listening to it, I was freaking out too.

179
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:13,140
And then later in 87, when I moved to New York for a to work for MTV, he would come by and

180
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,940
we hang out and it was just an awesome, awesome guy.

181
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,620
And of course, everyone knows a lot of his, I'll play, I can dream about you.

182
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:25,500
I'll play that one in a minute, let me just write that down.

183
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,540
But this is one of my all-time favorites with the winter brothers.

184
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,940
So although I'm playing songs from the people I really miss, not everyone is dead.

185
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,260
I played David Bowie earlier.

186
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,540
He's not dead, but he might as well be, because he sold his entire music catalog

187
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,140
for $50 million in the mid 90s.

188
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,140
I can't blame him for doing that, but he never really has done anything again.

189
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,140
And I miss him.

190
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:59,140
I miss songs like this.

191
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,740
I'm your source code.

192
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,940
Small jeans, you miss my cough.

193
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,140
I'm sitting, strong out of lasers.

194
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,740
Slash back blazes.

195
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,340
Ain't all your lasers while pulling the waders.

196
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,340
Talking about non-roll.

197
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,140
You're can't slow at.

198
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,140
New York's a goal goal and everything tastes nice.

199
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,940
Fall in a green head.

200
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,300
Can't you get back off?

201
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,380
.</

202
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,140
You viennent me.

203
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,460
Ooh there's all these bad.

204
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:38,540
The gentle about chin is that it's the sweetest schemes he pour.

205
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:43,300
But you cheated me, let your song go.

206
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,100
Cool.

207
00:27:50,100 --> 00:28:06,180
It's like a man, but smiles like a reptile to love him, she love him, but just for short

208
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:14,500
while scratching the sand, let go his hands, he sets these a new dish, sells you nutrition, keeps

209
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:29,660
all your dead health, making up underwear, all your greenies, the ginger, the lips on his back, the

210
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:38,980
ginger, the lips on his back, the ginger, the lips on his back, the ginger, the lips on his

211
00:28:38,980 --> 00:29:08,980
back, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth

212
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:38,980
the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth. The mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, mouth, the mouth, the mouth, the mouth

213
00:29:38,980 --> 00:30:08,820
I'm trying to remember the codes to send up the bat signal and I'm pretty sure I

214
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,820
thought to it.

215
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:19,700
They've bowed in the gene gene I've never seen him in like 1984 and Rotterdam.

216
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,340
My first real big concert, well maybe it was all inosis, my first big concert, but I remember

217
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,780
seeing David Bowen just being like, holy fuck would just happen to me.

218
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:35,860
I can't believe what I'm seeing, and we never see the guy anymore.

219
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,300
Where do you hear songs like this?

220
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,860
Thanks to Mitt Romney's company, Bain Capital, Cleared Channel, has rolled everything

221
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,980
up in America to mindless pieces of crap music radio.

222
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,620
Total fucking shit, we're all we want to do is just place a chance, it really means something

223
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,020
you know what I'm saying?

224
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,420
Alright, here's that song by Dan Hartman, I was talking about.

225
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:06,740
The best lyrics ever written as far as I'm concerned.

226
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:13,780
Video kind of suck, but then again, I can dream about you.

227
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:23,780
No more time, we each hear the thoughts of our minds.

228
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:31,780
I know, I need the remedy to cure this all over life.

229
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,780
I can dream about you.

230
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:42,780
If I can't help you, I can dream about you.

231
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,780
You know how to hold me just like.

232
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,780
I can dream about you.

233
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,780
If I can't hold it tonight.

234
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,780
I can dream about you.

235
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,780
You know how to hold me just like.

236
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,780
Move inside the door.

237
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,780
I don't see you in the past.

238
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,780
I can climb in all the front.

239
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:25,780
Down here below where the street takes me lonely for you.

240
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,780
No, I can dream about you.

241
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,780
If I can't hold it tonight.

242
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,780
I can dream about you.

243
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:43,780
You know how to hold me just like.

244
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,780
I can dream about you.

245
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,780
I don't know how to hold it tonight.

246
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:59,780
You know how to hold me just like.

247
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,780
Move inside the door.

248
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,780
I don't see you in the past.

249
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,780
I can dream about you.

250
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:18,780

I can dream about you.

253

You know how to hold me just like.

254
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:52,780
Move inside the door.

255
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,780
I don't understand it.

256
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,780
Can't dream about mine.

257
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,780
I don't know how to hold it tonight.

258
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,780
You know how to hold it tonight.

259
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:11,780
I can dream about you.

260
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:21,780
