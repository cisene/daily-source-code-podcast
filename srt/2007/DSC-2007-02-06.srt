1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh, miffy, look, there's Adam.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Adam, Adam.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh, look, he's wearing those rose colored glasses.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, per se.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, Adam, boy.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I hear you're still doing that show, though,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
dairy, saucecare.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You're up to what 540 shows now.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Two-shake good boy.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's a great, great job doing that for little people.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And they're thinking you've got going with the car.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Very funny stuff, you know, shooting in the tank and all.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They just keep Henry from drinking too much and shooting in his ponds.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have to go and sleep in the guest room when he does that.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, miffy, look, you're having to wet the bedroom.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You've had a few too many martinis.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, tell us Adam, what are you going with this posh people,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
their pig skits?

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's very funny stuff.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But you don't really believe that, do you?

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What?

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Why would you say that?

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What?

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You're really?

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, I'm slightly offended, Adam.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Well, Gary, you should just go on and do your D.R.C.540.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And the next generation renew contenting flight users.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We don't need no thinking.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I like to think I'm sorry.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We need to think you're in a good room.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I guess it's at a period.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't know her.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Maybe about it.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Could I justify all elevators who never have been cheated?

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
She don't remember.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Not a good inside.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So she picks a fight.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
She's right.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And all this black and white at killing time.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
She's a good girl.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000

She's a good girl.

137

She's a good girl.

138
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,080
coming to you from the Curry Manor on the west side of G-town in the affluent suburb of

139
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,960
Suri known as Gilford. And it's another beautiful day. Captain Dan just called me and said,

140
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,400
we're on for Friday. So traveling on Friday going to visit Cas Blaster Mike. Of course,

141
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,000
I immediately said, can we have a day like today as well? Wouldn't that be nice? It's another one

142
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,440
of those blue skies. A couple of clouds, but it looks like the ceiling is relatively high.

143
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,560
So we could just pop up over it and I wouldn't be nice to fly a little bit.

144
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,920
Come fly with me, my friends. It's Tuesday in the United Kingdom. Yesterday was man, what a day.

145
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,200
It was like non-stop. And as you know, there was so much Trinity stuff. It's luckily I was able to take

146
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:26,080
care of a lot of that yesterday that I was severely behind. I had an appointment to speak with

147
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,680
Barbara the Palo Alto podcaster who you've probably encountered on the Google group for free

148
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,080
Trinity, you know, to talk through how she could help with the project. And I was like an hour

149
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,880
and 10 minutes late. I was able to email during the show and stuff. But that's, you know, when

150
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,640
I'm an hour and a half late, then most of the day is pretty screwed up. And I don't think I was

151
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,720
done until like midnight, something like that. Anyway, Christina didn't have to get up very early

152
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,560
this morning. So we all kind of stayed in bed to like 830. What a luxury. Yes. Yes. Wonderful.

153
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,640
I got to plenty of plenty of stuff to go through today. I almost don't know where to start.

154
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,760
Let's see. Yeah. This is a nice one. Tony Schins, I will listen Belgium.

155
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,680
You actually has a YouTube site where he records himself doing drum solo. It was pretty cool.

156
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,000
He has a Saudi via that he uses to record his videos. He uses a reason and so on. All the

157
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,440
all the lovely tools to do that. At the same ground loop problem with the funky Belgium 240

158
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,520
volt system, here's how I limited the ground loop. Remove the ground. Okay. That makes sense. I guess

159
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,960
most of your sound equipment in via have a three-prong plug. I use an adapter on these three-prong

160
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:49,440
plug level. Let me see. I don't even know if there's a... I don't think it has a three-prong plug.

161
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,280
I'll look into that, but that doesn't sound like the most logical way to get rid of a ground loop

162
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,960
problem by removing the ground. Isn't the ground there for a reason? Any ends up as email by saying,

163
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,280
by the way, in Belgium it's very common for the top toilet seat to fall down. Is that an

164
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:13,440
engineering design? Is that a feature? What exactly is that? We might as well get straight into it.

165
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,280
I've been doing some research on the quest for answers to find out whether push people are

166
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,120
potty pigs. It certainly seems that way, and I do have my thoughts about it now, my friends.

167
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,960
I think it's something it's an inner child in all of us, because of actually witnessed, well,

168
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,440
not exactly the same thing, but we have a teenager here. And, as you know,

169
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,520
to live in the house, she happens to be related, love her dearly, but sometimes she's a teenager.

170
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,320
And there's two things that it's very interesting to observe from my vantage point, to see Patricia

171
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,840
and Christina, in this endless loop, an infinite loop, if you will, from a

172
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,200
programming engineer's perspective, an infinite loop, where Christina makes a mess in either a,

173
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,880
her room, or b, the bathroom. Now, it's not like there's toilet paper on the floor and stuff,

174
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,080
but there's clothes and she leaves bottles and stuff all over the place. And, you know, it's always

175
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,200
like, could you please clean it up? If you ask her to clean it up, but I've, I've long figured out

176
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,400
the reason why it doesn't happen, because if she doesn't clean it up, Patricia cleans it up.

177
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,040
And so we've gotten into this habit forming, where it's like, it doesn't matter because someone's

178
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,040
going to clean it up, and it'll be done. If it didn't get cleaned up, or, as I say,

179
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,160
if I dump them in the toilet bowl and then through the monitor bed, she might get the

180
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,840
message, of course, I'm never allowed to try any of my ideas. But, you know, as a student of

181
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,000
Anthony Robbins, people run away from pain and run towards pleasure. And I think that the pain level

182
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,080
of this infinite loop of clean up your shit just isn't enough because the reward is so high,

183
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,080
you know, just leave it and it takes care of itself. And I think this is exactly what's happening

184
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,400
in public bathrooms, whereas probably everybody, but most surprisingly, very well-mannered,

185
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,520
posh people who would not do something like this at home are doing it in their office bathrooms

186
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,520
in public restrooms that just leaving the shit all over the place. Yes, or what, you know,

187
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,520
I mean, of course it happens that you sometimes you might just miss your target or something

188
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,880
nasty can happen. But why clean it up because it's going to be cleaned tomorrow? It's like magic.

189
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,800
I think that is part of the problem. But we're learning a lot about our fellow man in this

190
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,680
quest, my friends. Hey, Adam, this is Tokyo Dan. I haven't given you a feedback for a long time,

191
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,000
but this is for the our posh people, pig segment. Lately, in the last 20 years over here in Japan,

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,800
things have been proved a lot lately, and the Japanese aren't too piggy, even the posh people.

193
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,120
But one thing that does bug me, if you go to a public restroom, and you want to use the shitter,

194
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,120
right? These guys just, they stay in there. They're camping out in there and, you know, the stalls

195
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,000
are all full. You really need to go. And these guys are in there just, I don't know what they're doing.

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
They don't come in. Don't they live in there? Isn't the housing such a problem in Japan that

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,960
maybe they're just using them as, as they're peer to tear? Well, in the city, I live in Stahl 13.

198
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,200
Ma, are they, are they reading? Are they sleeping? Are they beating off? I don't know, but just

199
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,720
get the hell out of the toilet. No, it's a public toilet. It's not in your home. Other people are

200
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,320
waiting. Other people want to use it. They have no regard for the people waiting. People of Japan.

201
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,240
People of Tokyo. If Tokyo Dan or Brake will get that hell out of the stall, really bugs me.

202
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,000
One of the good things about it over here is a lot of the public toilets, especially in the department

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,760
stores and movie theaters. They have what we call Star Trek toilets. I mean, these, these toilets

204
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:07,280
have like armrest with all kind of controls on it. Today, hot air that blows on you to dry

205
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,560
off and you can actually adjust the pressure of the bidet, the hotness of the air and all this.

206
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,240
When you're standing up, taking a leak in one of these things, you have to be careful that

207
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,120
you don't hit the wrong button. I tell you, man, I've had one of those toilets and I love them.

208
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,640
I absolutely love them. And I'm thinking about getting, I mean, they're big. That's the problem

209
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
and the bathrooms in the manner. There's enough bathrooms, but they're, I don't know if they're

210
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,920
big enough for one of these basically snowmobile type devices, but I love them. I had them at the

211
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,680
the bunker in Amsterdam. In place we had there, it was so nice. You sit down immediately.

212
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:50,800
A fan starts, starts sucking away any odours. Not a lot of controls, by the way. It's not

213
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,960
necessary to have all those controls if it's a proper one. When you're done with your business,

214
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:02,640
you press little button, a little faucet comes out, turns up. Mr. Fires, and bidet of Fires,

215
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,080
your private area with a nice warm squeeze. Completely adjustable, of course.

216
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:17,200
Upon letting loose of the button, the blow dryer turns on. They are wonderful, Dan.

217
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,400
Because you might get a stream of air or a stream of water blown right into your face,

218
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:28,000
they have to be careful. Another thing is, the women's toilets I heard, as soon as you open the

219
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,200
stall, the stall door, the sound of flowing water starts playing. And this is just to cover up the

220
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,040
more embarrassing natural sounds. So, things are pretty advanced over here. So that's about the

221
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,640
only pet peeve I've had about the way the Japanese use their toilets over here, but oh no, it's pretty

222
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,240
good. Well if you want to hear more interesting things about Japan, check out the frustration

223
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:02,800
segment. On my, what's happening in Tokyo podcast at www.whi-to-k-y-o-o.info. And while we're on the

224
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,200
subject, I'm a folder. Take it easy, Adam. All right, dude. Talk to you, Dan, everybody. From Tokyo,

225
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:17,520
it's over to India. Greetings and salutations, Adam Curry. This is Parmac Pazwami from

226
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Calcutta. And I want to talk about Pazwami people being pigs, because here in Calcutta,

227
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,720
it is not always Pazwami people who are pigs, but sometimes when I go visit a buy, a buy who

228
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:38,560
sets me my shoes. I step off the corner right into a big pile of Cal Puppy. And that is the problem

229
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,240
here in Calcutta. There is Cal Puppy everywhere on the streets. So, it is not just Pazwami people

230
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,120
who are pigs. It is the cows. The cows that are pigs too. So, please understand. It doesn't matter

231
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,200
if you are a Paz or if you are poor or if you are just a cow, you can still be a pig. Anyway,

232
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,960
keep up to go work, Adam Curry. You are doing a very, very good job. This is the point where

233
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,400
I would tell you that I am a folder, except I have nothing to fault. Thank you very much.

234
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:15,680
Ah, yes. Mark Yoshimaru Nemkoff, that is about the worst Indian accent I have heard

235
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,400
in a long time. But I appreciate the thought, my friend.

236
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,520
Ah, no, no, no, no. Besides, you can get in trouble for doing that, man. In the UK. Because

237
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,000
we are also politically correct now. Hey, by the way, there is something I forgot to mention,

238
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:40,080
just a little interlude here. About the Super Bowl, I was so happy that political

239
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,440
correctness seems to have dropped just one notch in the interest of fucking sanity in the world.

240
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,160
You know, there were two black coaches in the Super Bowl. So, over and over and over again,

241
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:59,360
in the media what you kept hearing was, there will be for the first time in history a black

242
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,240
coach who was taken a team to victory the Super Bowl. And I'm like, this is fantastic.

243
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,480
We're no longer stuck to the African American. And I love it. I really do. Hey, it's black, white,

244
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,480
yellow, red, you know, just get over and deal with it. It's fantastic. Let's just call it that way.

245
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,040
We're all people. But it was nice, you know. I don't know why that happened. If it has

246
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,200
something to do with the mechanics of the sport and how that's reported. But it was just

247
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:34,720
refreshing. Let me say that. In our quest to find out if posh people or potty pigs,

248
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:43,040
I want to know if women are bigger slabs than men. Hello Adam. This is Stella from Brisbane. California.

249
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,280
I know you wanted to hear from women as your guards. Posh people are potty pigs.

250
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Well, I'm here to report that women are not any better than men. I do to work very early

251
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:07,760
in the morning. You start out at six. It is so wonderful to go in to clean bathroom and lock

252
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:16,080
her room. At your inclusive day, when I have to go to bathroom, well, seems like a hurricane

253
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:25,520
I just go through the bathroom and lock her up. There's hangers all over the place. There's toilet paper

254
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,440
on the floor. Mm-hmm. Sound familiar? Does it sound a lot like a 16-year-old little been

255
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,360
living there? I'm telling you it was the inner child. Paper towels. That portion of the reason

256
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:45,840
people miss the very large garbage can. That is there in the room for them to place dirt dirty.

257
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:54,400
Paper towels tend to be saying that it's so disgusting that some women, I don't know why

258
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,480
they know how they do this. This women who have their monthly career, they offer

259
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,280
them to date on the floor. I don't know. It's too much information. There's red all over your seats.

260
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,320
I feel sorry for the cleaning guide when I have to come in and clean after

261
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:20,080
during the disaster. I'm sorry to report that there's a lot of tissue women out there too,

262
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,640
well, how's it going? Something bizarrely sexy about the way you were phoned in that report.

263
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:34,800
Thank you so much. All right, so guys, part of this is up to us and this is referring back to

264
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,880
these bits and tinkland common from yesterday that men literally destroy bathrooms. I had a brief

265
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,800
conversation with a lady Patricia about this yesterday and she's like, let's do this show. We've

266
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,240
got to do a show because I have something to say about, okay, but of course you had to go to

267
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,320
the hairdresser today at 1130. So she can't be on the show, you know, much more pressing items.

268
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,880
But it is true. She says, you know, just from one guy in the house, pretty much me.

269
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:06,240
And I guess, uh, Indiana, Indiana, Indiana, Indiana, Christina's bow. My son-in-law.

270
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:13,280
That she says, you know, urine is just everywhere. It's on the walls. It's on the mirrors.

271
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,080
And she says, yeah, it's just, there's so much force. And of course, I'm quite tall. So when it

272
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:25,600
actually hits the toilet bowl, you know, it just splatters. And I'm very, you know, so here you go.

273
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,520
Here's the inner child thing. It's like, I'm not to worry about. It's something to clean it up, you know,

274
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,520
today's I will clean it up or Patricia will clean it up or maybe I'll wipe it down if I see it.

275
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,400
Now it's the whole running away from pain and running towards pleasure. And there's just, there's no,

276
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:46,400
there's no downside from me not cleaning it up. But I love my wife very much. And I want to please her.

277
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,640
So I have started a test. And I have to equate this to the Nokia N800 tablet. It took me a while

278
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,600
to get used to using the on screen keyboard. It really did. And now I'm pretty much hooked on the

279
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,080
thing. The via was not left the docking station for four or five days. I've been using the tablet

280
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,280
all over the house. But you have to get used to it. So I've been trying Zitz and Tinklin.

281
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:16,640
Zitz and Tinklin all a lot. Come on. I'm a problem. I've been practicing urinating while

282
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,360
being seated. And I understand all of a sudden this morning as I tried this out. I understand why

283
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,360
guys don't want to do it. You know, for for 40 years at least, I think I can't remember. I should

284
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,480
look at my baby book when I was potty trained. Let's say it's 40 years. I've been urinating

285
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:41,280
while standing. And sitting on the toilet bowl, my entire body and brain and everything about me is

286
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,800
condition that this is for a different delivery. This, you know, we're dropping the kids off at the

287
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,400
pool here. So all kinds of muscles and things get into spring into action. Whereas that's not the

288
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,640
not what I want to do. So, and I think that's why it feels very unnatural for guys. For women,

289
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,280
you sit down, you know what your mission is. You know, all the pieces move and function in the

290
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,640
right order and you're done. Regardless of what you're going to do there. For guys, it's like you're

291
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:19,040
sitting down. I wait a minute. The depose empty. But I think that within four or five days,

292
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,840
I will be able to completely have to retrain my brain and there'll be no looking back.

293
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,280
Our posh people of peace. Speaking of, uh, speaking of this, have you ever heard of the guys

294
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,520
called Dirty Sanchez? I don't know if it's OJ from who's on it. I'm letting you know that we've

295
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,600
got those guys from Wales. You know the ones that white poo in each other's faces. You don't know

296
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,400
I'm talking about it's dirty Sanchez. If you want to see how bad they go hot when they were telling

297
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,360
me about grandmother and stuff which quite frankly, you need to not be eating when you hear about it.

298
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,960
Well, go to who's on it's dot pp pod show dot com. Cheers mate. Hey, OJ. Thank you. My man.

299
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,640
OJ is a cheap ass man. You couldn't record a comment for me. You have to dial. He's

300
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,160
completely phoning it in ladies and gentlemen. The infamous OJ boards from pod show UK.

301
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,520
Yeah, you got to see this show. It's up now. Dirty Sanchez. They've done a movie. It's a very

302
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:23,120
jackass like, but essentially they do a lot with poo. Exactly. You can't help but laugh

303
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,200
when you see what these guys are into. I think you really like this though. They're on OJ's

304
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,000
red couch and while they're talking, OJ's basically give him a whole bunch of shit about being

305
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,440
from Wales, which is I guess kind of for the British is like, you know, the Americans are

306
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,080
say, well, you're from Canada. Something like that. And his grandmother rings.

307
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,160
Calls him on a cell phone is mobile. So you definitely have to check that out.

308
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,240
Hey, for the past two or three weeks, a PD love from daddy cast and the love house radio has been

309
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,120
providing fantastic openings. You heard the posh people opening for today's daily source code. Of

310
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,040
course, you're always welcome to send something in yourself. That's kind of stop that flow of

311
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,880
of intros. And whenever I have more than one, I'll use all of them. Unless they're like too long

312
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,360
or ridiculous. And so I just wanted to give the man some props for, yeah, for doing that for me.

313
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,600
Because every single day, it's like a wake up. I'm doing my show prep and like a big smile on

314
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,000
my face when I see that there's something from PD love. Where is it?

315
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,480
This is all the stuff that came from the hospital, but it's not here. It's got to be around here somewhere.

316
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,640
If you're new parent, I have some shocking news for you. Kids don't come with an owner's

317
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,120
main. Now granted, if you're a guy, you wouldn't read it anyway, but you know, if you're

318
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,520
having one of those days, you may need a little help. Or perhaps you've had a breakthrough

319
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,200
that you want to share with those who can benefit from your newfound parental wisdom.

320
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,120

Daddycast. Because some days, you just need a little hand.

328
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
Listen to my dad and say, I don't.

329
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:48,160
Fagers. That's right. It finally happened my friends. The official burp of the Charlie has now

330
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:55,040
been filled up with some Joe. That's a good one. What's your Charlie without some Joe? That's

331
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,560
right. Folgers coffee is now sponsoring the daily source code. Very happy to welcome them.

332
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,440
They're smart, man. They heard the whole Senseo thing. That's over. Last time you'll hear

333
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,160
about Senseo from me. Now it's about the Folgers gourmet selections, coffee flavors.

334
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,520
I have this at the condo. As you know, I don't have a capuccino machine at the condo.

335
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,280
And I've been using it. It's not I don't have the gourmet selection coffee flavors.

336
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,520
Let's see. They come in espresso roast. Yeah. No, I do have espresso roast. I'm sorry. I have that one.

337
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,520
Lively Colombian or Lively Colombian decaf. That's a dichotomy if I ever heard one.

338
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,760
Morning cafe. Oh, these are good, man. Morning cafe. Like body with a clean finish and a

339
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,200
delicate bright taste in a Roma or how about vanilla biscotti smooth vanilla flavor with a creamy

340
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,560
finish or the chocolate truffle creamy smooth and rich with an irresistible chocolatey flavor.

341
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,800
But maybe you want the rich flavor of hazelnut cream with an enticing aroma and smooth finish or

342
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,800
ladies a caramel drizzle a hint of creamy caramel flavor with a warm rich finish.

343
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,960
Also available in holding varieties. Hey, I'm really happy that they're that they're advertising

344
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,200
and that they've picked up a picked up where other coffee people didn't understand what to do.

345
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,000
And I'm also very happy that the folks at Syria stars 102 on the satellite were able to hear this.

346
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,920
We're going to leave you guys satellite window is closing. I'll talk to you guys tomorrow here on 102

347
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,760
and for those of you on the podcast. Yeah, I'd like you to go and try out the Foldiers gourmet

348
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,240
selections. In fact, you can get a free sample if you go to fulgers.com slash pod show

349
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
while supplies last so you got to hurry up

350
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,280
and let me know. Let me know which one you like. When I get back to San Francisco because I don't believe

351
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,640
the gourmet selections are available here. I'm going to look at the San'sbury

352
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:05,440
but that's it. I even broke up broke out the the old coffee machine here in in the manner.

353
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,400
So at least we have the espresso roast. I got to see if I'd like to try the caramel drizzle sounds kind of

354
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,800
interesting. So of course, whenever whenever I burp you're going to think fulgers

355
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:27,760
or whenever you burp you're going to think fulgers. Because what's the chacha without a great

356
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,880
cup of Joe? Hey Adam, I just wanted to let you know that you're driving me crazy with this whole HD

357
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,680
HD thing. Not all Brits say H. Some of us know there's no H at the beginning of H. Anyway,

358
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,920
while I'm here I wanted to say a quick hello and introduce myself. My name's John and I produce a

359
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,040
weekly video podcast about photography and digital photo post processing using Adobe Photoshop

360
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:55,120
and all that fun stuff. You can find my show at photo walkthrough.btpotshow.com. I'm just doing the

361
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,840
BTpotshow network and I'm loving the support you guys are giving to us podcasters. So thanks for having

362
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,160
me on board and I'm really looking forward to meeting some of you guys at the next boot up at the

363
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:09,840
London crash pad. So when's that going to be? Hey yeah, tell me if you're a folder or a scruncher

364
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,040
and we'll talk about it, my friend. I thought I had another burp. It's not coming. Good.

365
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,720
Now, warning the following song is explicit in nature and should be deemed defensive by people

366
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,240
of all religions. All right, dude, Sunday morning, wake and bake. Sorry. No room for you,

367
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,440
crews of faggot. Oh, you're such a yuck. Hey, ultra boy. Want some jesus too. Even if there's

368
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,080
suck dogs in hell. That's not cool. Your chacha is for homo. The intelligent design theory has been

369
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:45,360
just proof. Oh, wookie wookie. I just don't know what to believe anymore.

370
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,360
Think it's not cool to love our Lord and save you. Jesus Christ.

371
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:15,600
Damn, my lord. The ball. Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Holy shit. Who save us all from the shit from

372
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,560
brains. They call Satan. Make a freeze. Jesus tight. Fucking hell. God suck and tith fucking

373
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:33,440
piss. Chuck and ask fish and Jesus on a jet scale. Papa fucking cry. Yeah, yeah. Oh, man.

374
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Jesus Christ. God. Thought you love a church of identical evils and pretty delicious.

375
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,040
As like every Tourette sufferers dream song you if you could sing along. That should be in

376
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,000
Tourette karaoke. Hey, that's a good idea. Tourette karaoke.

377
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,160
Ah, that showed up on the podcast and music network. Those are the same guys who did the song.

378
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,480
Hey, girl. Take off the t-shirt if you don't know any of the bands on it. I think that's a title of the song.

379
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,720
You know, I'm so pleased about about you guys as an audience because you really get into all the

380
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:20,080
stuff that I'm into and it's really it's so cool. I've been talking a lot about about Nokia devices

381
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,720
of course, you know, and I don't get paid by those guys. You know, we're trying to get some money from them,

382
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,360
but that's not the point. You know, about the tablet about the E61 and it's great because you sent me

383
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,960
email messages. I just bought one of those because I really like what I was hearing.

384
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:44,880
And so I I was looking for a way to get podcasts onto this pretty much open device seeing

385
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,160
as it runs a Debbie and Linux. And I got an email from Craig Meyer who says, hey, I purchased an

386
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,920
N800 for myself, awesome device. I did your X 11 VNC trick. I posted that on curry.com where I could

387
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:02,160
remotely control a Mac from the from the tablet and I could control the tablet from the Mac. That was cool.

388
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:11,440
And he's pointing me to some new applications specifically G Potter, which is a port of the Python version

389
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:19,360
of of iPodder. And I'm like, yeah. And so, you know, I tried to install it. And then of course,

390
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,280
and it is kind of the device is smart. It says, no, no, you need to depend on this. You need to put the

391
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:29,600
Python run time in. And I'm kind of lost now because for some reason, my application list or something

392
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,200
isn't updating properly, I'll figure it out. It just takes a little bit of time. But that's a fantastic

393
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:41,600
news that the G Potter is all, the, you know, the iPodder code, the whole concept is ported to this device.

394
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,400
And I guess we could, I, it probably has a pretty much a command line based interface. I think,

395
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,680
who knows? I haven't been able to get it fire up yet. It might have an interface. I don't know.

396
00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:02,160
I can't wait to try it. I'm so excited. Let me see if there are a couple other, couple other messages

397
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,560
about Nokia. See, I'm doing the pronunciation right here, too. Hey, Adam loved your comment on

398
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:13,600
and Dick Chargers for new Nokia's couldn't agree more. Worst decision ever. See Miss Leverie.

399
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,560
Yeah, I hit home with that one, didn't I? Hi, this is Peter from Germany.

400
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,240
Since you're in contact with Nokia on a quite regular basis, I was wondering whether you might

401
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:31,120
ask them why they changed this fucking charger plug. Because this, there's maybe no technical reason

402
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,880
as far as I can see. Well, because there's an adapter that you can simply plug in all the older

403
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:44,240
accessories for charging that you have. And it simply, there's no point for me in having the new plug

404
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,640
because well, you have the accessories. And this was one of the point why I was buying Nokia

405
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:58,400
except from being patriotic for Finland is that you have this accessory, then you still can use them

406
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,640
for with every new model. So why don't you ask them when you're doing your turn at the

407
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,840
one, six things? No, of course. No, I already got an answer. It's due to

408
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,960
miniaturization. And by the way, all the new Nokia phones do come with a little adapter plug so

409
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,200
you can plug your old charger into it on one end and then the other end is one of those little

410
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,440
antique things. Yeah, it's a designed design decision made by engineers. I'm sure, as I said,

411
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,920
it's because of miniaturization. And I'm okay with that because all the new phones will just standardize

412
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:37,840
again on the new miniature plugs. All I'm was saying is that they're really fragile. And, you know,

413
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,800
if I can say anything that I think anyone who was had a Nokia phone will agree with these things

414
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:50,320
are in the fucking structural. I've dropped them. I've had cars drive over and Patricia has

415
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,480
dropped her into the toilet multiple times, multiple times. You know, hairdryer, things work and again,

416
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,000
so I've always enjoyed that. You know, oh, my phone fell on the ground. You know, and sometimes,

417
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,400
you know, the cover would explode and the keypad would fall off, but you could put it all back together again.

418
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,960
And it just works. You know, I really love the product. Not being endorsed to say that.

419
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,400
But now with the, with the small plugs, if it drops on the floor, with the plug attached, or if you pick it

420
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,760
up with the plug attached, whereas the plug would just kind of like tune, shoot out, or at least hold

421
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,800
its ground now at the end. Bricks off. That's a real pain in the ass.

422
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:35,440

428
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,040
Hey Adam, guess who composed that wonderful little song? That is of course the short version

429
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:26,480
from the Jeff Smith. It's Ray Anthony in New York City, and on DSC number 536, you play the song

430
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,600
by Pete Hopkins. And artist, I just so happened to interview last week for the next episode of my

431
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,760
podcast at radioguide.com. Here is just a sample, Pete Hopkins, talking about writing the song I

432
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,200
won't cry. Just a story, so, and it was on my mind, so the lyric part was easy. All I had to do

433
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,520
was just spit out how I was feeling about things, and the bass line, I think the bass line was one

434
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,560
of the first thing that actually, the music came, and it just had the sort of cadence to it,

435
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:03,120
and I had those chords that were like, damn, damn, and that sounded like in my head. I don't even

436
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,200
think about you. So I had that thing going. It came so naturally, it was just, all I had to do

437
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:19,360
was just pretty much follow my heart, even though I was feeling, and translate that through music.

438
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,720
In this world, and I'll find love a new dear, so don't you trouble your girl the girl's,

439
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:54,080
I'm not thinking about you, just stop pretending I'm home in my life waiting by the phone,

440
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:03,440
hoping my car say that you're sobbing, baby, don't be a fool, you will never that cool.

441
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:14,000
I won't cry, no tears in my mouth, I won't choose a cause of action to give you no satisfaction,

442
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:24,160
I got no hope, I don't even care, so go out and find another to take a loving, your loving if you dare.

446
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
Music

447
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Music

448
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
Music

449
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Music

450
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
Music

451
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
Music

452
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Music

453
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Oh oh cry

454
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Oh cry

455
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
Oh cry

456
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
Oh cry

457
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,440
No sound is much like a northern sphere

458
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Don't even care

459
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
Go out and find another

460
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,440
Go out and find another

461
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Go out and find another

462
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
Oh cry

463
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
Oh cry

464
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
Oh cry

465
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Oh cry

466
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,440
Oh cry

467
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
I think you'll agree with me that there is some kind of

468
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,440
Revolution of wood when you hear songs like this coming out the pod save music network

469
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Pete Hopkins

470
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
Five four zero

471
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
That's a little bit of info a little

472
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
An interview there

473
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
Good old Pete

474
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
That's really what does it man is that relationship between the

475
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
Yeah

476
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
A producer of a show

477
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
His audience or her audience

478
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
And the artists

479
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
I love it

480
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
I just absolutely love it

481
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Oh okay, let's see

482
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
Yeah

483
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
It's almost time for free Trinity update

484
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Hi Adam

485
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
It's your favorite kentish girl

486
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,440
Josephine Lawrence

487
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,440
I am popping into the office to film episode four of pod find a UK

488
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,440
And I'd really like to meet you

489
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
So hopefully I'll see you there

490
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
Bye bye

491
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
I'll see you all I see you

492
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
I'll see you on

493
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
I'll see you on Thursday

494
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
Yeah, that's it because

495
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
I'm going into meet comic strip blogger

496
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
It's going to happen at the shortage crash pad

497
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
It's going to interview me and we're going to be filming the event

498
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
Traveling across the USA

499
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Open and make a good time today

500
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,440
I feel like I've been watching you go

501
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,440
Letting everybody go

502
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
This is going to be the better way

503
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Whoa

504
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
The Trinity

505
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
Trinity

506
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Trinity

507
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Trinity let the bio diesel set you bring

508
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,440
As I said I had a great conversation yesterday with

509
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Apollo also podcaster Barbara

510
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,440
And she's great

511
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,440
She's going to be collecting data

512
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,440
Presenting that in multiple forms

513
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Of course we're going to populate our map

514
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,440
And that's how we're going to plan out the route

515
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
We're Trinity and I think we should get her going

516
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
In a week or two when I get back to San Francisco

517
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
I think we're almost ready

518
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
The Google group again you can find a link to that

519
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
It's a daily source code dot com

520
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
It's definitely filling up with

521
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Heekly want to participate

522
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
I got to get Jeff Smith on the case

523
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
We got to get some more jingles and imaging

524
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
I got to get Chris Boshiers

525
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,440
To do some cool video bumpers

526
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
That's going to be awesome

527
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Really is

528
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,440
And good news from Rosie

529
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
From podshow HQ

530
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
I got a little Trinity for a 500 mile journey

531
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
And she writes via email to me

532
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Adam the trip was a success

533
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
She ran very well

534
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Little slow going up hills

535
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
And also seemed to get a bit hot

536
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
But then cooled down right after the summit

537
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
I shot video on a cheap video camera

538
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
We have all transfer the files this week

539
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
And make an edit ASAP

540
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
I'll probably ask Andrew backster to help me

541
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
What length do you want me to limit the editor to?

542
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
A couple minutes, Rosie just show the fun you had

543
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
This is something else that

544
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
I think I've changed my mind on

545
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
Now that I've been reading through the group

546
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
It doesn't seem like a very good idea to hook up a trailer

547
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
It's a Trinity

548
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
Because it's only like 90 horsepower

549
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Some very low number like that

550
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
I think it's bright

551
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Maybe she comes right in a little higher

552
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
But after 23 years

553
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
So I don't think we're going to be able to get up hills

554
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
If we're you know, we're slipping around

555
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
gallons of

556
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
Unprocessed vegetable oil

557
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
And lie and all the stuff you need to make

558
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Biodies also

559
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
I think we'll have to forgo that

560
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
Wonderful

561
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,440
Technology discussion though

562
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
On the Google Group

563
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
About how to

564
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
Use the Nokia N800

565
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
To send back

566
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
Pictures and video regular intervals

567
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,440
And GPS coordinates so we can track Trinity on her way

568
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
And it's really geeky

569
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,440
So I'm totally loving that

570
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
Moving out of

571
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Newport again

572
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,440
Great one

573
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,440
Now Black Connect is the internet

574
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,440
Catching up on DHC

575
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
Catching up on the Google Group

576
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,440
I just wanted to ask Bondil whether or not

577
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,440
To use the code for Trinity dot watch

578
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,440
And there's no one going to

579
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Smack that one before we use it for the

580
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Posting content

581
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Just so I mentioned that in case

582
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
That one's good for this mind

583
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
Yeah, thank you very much, New

584
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
Interesting because yesterday I did

585
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
I wanted to start a show free Trinity dot pod show dot com

586
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
And it was already taken

587
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Like a crap

588
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
So I did like free Trinity project

589
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,440
Dot pod show dot com and I figured someone

590
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
It probably

591
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
Actually I kind of thought someone would have

592
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
Just registered it just to protect it like you

593
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
Suggest there

594
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440
Of course it was Barbara

595
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
And Doug Pilgrim has been nice enough to

596
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,440
Regirect free Trinity dot com to curry dot com

597
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
Actually it would be nice to

598
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,440
Doug if you could redirect free Trinity dot com

599
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
To free Trinity dot pod show dot com

600
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,440
And what we'll get

601
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,440
We'll get the site up and running

602
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Folks things are happening

603
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
As Barbara said this one's for the doers of the world

604
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,440
And there's a heck of a lot of you

605
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,440
And I really dig it

606
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
Programmer come on in

607
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,440
I am this is the prolific program

608
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
Again this time from Toronto

609
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
Chennai

610
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
And the thing I go from here

611
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
I'm for the e-week because

612
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
Oh, it's a good thing it's in the section

613
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
On DSD

614
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
539 I think it

615
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Then one

616
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
Yeah 539

617
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,440
Was actually

618
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Wonder if it would probably

619
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
Better to glue the other way

620
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,440
Diver up through Alaska

621
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
And close to during

622
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
Straight I do believe

623
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
And sing one

624
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,440
When the light is free

625
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,440
Of course then in that case

626
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
It makes for an interesting scene

627
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,440
I wonder if it would work with any

628
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
I believe it would be very

629
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
Straight up very deep enough

630
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,440
And if the ice freezes

631
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,440
The water to the level where deep enough

632
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
It will be able to cross with that problem

633
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
Um, hope you're here for me

634
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,440
Up to this place

635
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440
It's some point on the show

636
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
And I also hope you got my

637
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
Us message regarding

638
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
Um

639
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
You could work with this

640
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
Just off in the UK

641
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
Uh, cheers

642
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
Yo cheers

643
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,440
Programmer from the Bay Area everybody

644
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
And Programmer

645
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
I'd expected you might be hacking the Nokia N800

646
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,440
By the way my my contact my deep-throed contact at the Nokia says

647
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,440
When you guys are ready

648
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,440
There are development sheet machines available

649
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,440
So you can really

650
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,440
Develop on the machine itself

651
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
I'm just saying you know

652
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
You might want to listen to that Programmer

653
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
Call in again

654
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
It took me a couple times

655
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,440
Yeah, I sometimes have to rewind him

656
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,440
And that's the reason why I put it on

657
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,440
He seems like a real character man

658
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
The Programmer I just love it

659
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,440
Just before I go and I do have one more song for you

660
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
Which is kind of wacky I thought it played for you

661
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
Um

662
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
They did a test

663
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,440
Uh, they put a number of uh, of test subjects

664
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,440
Into an MRI

665
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
That's uh, does a brain scan

666
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,440
While they were watching

667
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
Um

668
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
Super Bowl commercials

669
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,440
And there's been a couple of reports about him

670
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,440
Actually I found one in my Google reader

671
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
And for some reason I lost it

672
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,440
I thought I had started

673
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,440
But I guess I didn't so it's almost impossible to find it

674
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,440
You can't really search against your existing subscriptions

675
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,440
Unless I'm missing how to do that

676
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,440
Which of course is a flaw

677
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,440
Um

678
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
But apparently the way the

679
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,440
The media is taking this and I don't know if this is going to be very wide spread reporting

680
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,440
Most of the

681
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,440
Commercials fell

682
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
Completely flat

683
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,440
Let me just quote from a scene at article here

684
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,440
Uh, using brain scan images of people who watch advertisements air during some days

685
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,440
Championship game researches can show which ads triggered various emotions in viewers

686
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
Causing them to be fired up or emotionally flat

687
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,440
Federal expresses or FedEx's ad supposedly fell flat

688
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,440
The commercials that inspired the most engagement

689
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,440
Meaning responses of fear

690
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,440
Desire

691
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
Conflict and reward

692
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,440
Where Disney's NFL dreamers and CR missed airport security ads

693
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,440
According to researchers from University of California, Los Angeles

694
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,440
A manson, loveless, brain mapping center

695
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,440
And FKF applied research

696
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
Oh, that's a mouthful

697
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,440
Very interesting

698
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,440
Because it's a bummer

699
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,440
Because I was well, they posted the images in the data online which is nice

700
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
So going and reinterpret

701
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,440
But I didn't have time while prepping the show because there was this other article

702
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,440
Really explained each one in great detail

703
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,440
But just the paraphrase

704
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,440
Most of the commercials evoked

705
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,440
An emotional response of fear

706
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,440
Fear

707
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,440
And making men want to fight

708
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,440
And I thought that was very interesting

709
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,440
And the reports are saying, well, so they fell flat

710
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,440
They didn't work

711
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
I disagree

712
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,440
I really disagree

713
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,440
I think that advertising of course works best when associated with an emotion

714
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,440
Such as laughter

715
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,440
Sadness

716
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,440
When a commercial really tugs at your heartstrings and you well up

717
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,440
And of course fear

718
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,440
And fear is so easy to speak to

719
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,440
Now, I don't know if it's intentional

720
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,440
But I think if commercials are evoking fear

721
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,440
Well, bingo

722
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,440
And that's what the news uses to keep you watching is fear

723
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,440
Bird flu, you can die

724
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,440
Right after the commercials

725
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,440
Commercials

726
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,440
You'll never get laid

727
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,440
If you don't use art, is it cream

728
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,440
So I think that the analysis is wrong

729
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,440
I think it's fascinating though

730
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
That the

731
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,440
The commercials

732
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,440
Pretty much all evoked that same emotion

733
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,440
Coca-Cola I think gave people a warm happy feeling

734
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,440
But warm and happy doesn't mean that the commercial is a success

735
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,440
And I think that men, particularly men

736
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,440
1834 who were studied in this particular group

737
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,440
I think that they

738
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,440
They are angry a lot more often during the day

739
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,440
And probably when they're angry they think

740
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,440
I'm angry

741
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,440
I need a Budweiser

742
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,440
Something like that

743
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,440
I'll put a link in the show notes daily source code

744
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,440
dot com so you can take a look

745
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,440
At this interesting survey

746
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,440
When you have

747
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
Will be filled

748
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,440
The light

749
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,440
Because my must

750
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,440

That is going to love you

753
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,440
Like you're never going to cry again

754
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,440
That is going to heal you

755
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,440
From all that kind

756
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,440
I came

757
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,440

Let's find you home

764
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,440
He's begging you soon

765
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,440
To come dreaming with him

766
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,440
He's beaming straight

767
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,440
Into your bedroom

768
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,440
Because my must

769
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,440

And if those little worries come along

775
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,440
They won't be staying around

776
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,440
Too long

Have gone

781
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,440
There's nothing to do

782
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,440
But you hold on to

783
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,440

Sleep tight

787

Don't let the bed

Julie Slinn

The master mill for the pod save music network

796
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,440
Mama's gonna rock you tonight

797
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,440
I just thought I was an interesting

798
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,440
Voice interesting song

799
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,440
She's from the UK

800
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,440
Not quite sure where not all the details

801
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,440
I don't pod to music that work

802
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,440
Of course I'll point to that in the show

803
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,440
No state resource code.com

804
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,440
20 years as support

805
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,440
Support artists in various bands in the United Kingdom

806
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,440
Huh?

807
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,440
Interesting

808
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
