1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Potion needs you to help us suck the less.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, I'm getting sick of it too.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I have this sprint with Potion Radio.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The bottom line is this.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
As soon as this shows over, go over to suckless.potion.com.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Get in, get out, and for God's sake, get out with your life.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Because if you don't...

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Help us suck less help us suck less potion.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Eat you to help us suck less.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's his Tony and Tony.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And you're listening to the DSE 612.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, no animals were actually hurt in the making of the DSE 612.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But there are two sheep and a bunny that were a little mentally scotch, I would say.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And he dumped us.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want my cat back.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, yeah, dumped us.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Tony, let's just get back.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I knew you could be.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't want to wake you, you know me better.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's once again talk about the time together.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Not the dream, not the time you said.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Every little baby, no one's in one's life.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
every little baby, no one's in one's life.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He's so cute, he's so cute, he's so cute, he's so cute

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He's so cute, he's so cute, he's so cute

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He's so cute, he's so cute, he's so cute

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He's so cute, he's so cute, he's so cute

He's so cute, he's so cute

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He's so cute, he's so cute

65

He's so lovely, he's so cute

66

He's so cute, he's so cute

67

He's so cute, he's so cute

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He's so cute, he's so cute

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The first video we focused on

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and the first video we worked on

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The third video we filmed

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,680
Suburb of Suri known as Gilford,

74
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,120
we're on the west side of Utah.

75
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,820
I'm bringing you everything completely,

76
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,380
full barred and with lots of music.

77
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,320
It's like I picked a wrong week, please smoke it.

78
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,560
It's got a syrups of shit in it.

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,600
Gilford's got a moon on it.

80
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
The race is dead and it made me feel better.

81
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,800
Someone's bound to die.

82
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,040
Let's go.

83
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
Let's go.

84
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:04,040
We're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah.

85
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:34,040
We're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of

86
00:06:34,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the east side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the east side of Utah and we're on the east side of Utah and we're on the east side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the south side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the east side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on the west side of Utah and we're on

87
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:14,040
To the supermarket, it's great people in the face, I'll live here, let's do it

88
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,040
When it's around the corner, but I don't think I'm making it there

89
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Because it's almost right at it, I don't care

90
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,040
There from Los Angeles, California, and of course proud members of the Podsake Music Network

92
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:48,040
The Hot Rods almost Friday night, and indeed it is, and oh, I can't tell you how horrible

93
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,040
I feel about missing yesterday's show, it just didn't happen

94
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,040
After I went to the crash pad early, well relatively early

95
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:02,040
I did of course prepare a lot of stuff for the show, and you know, had a photo shoot for this Vaughn magazine

96
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Which is Doug Monies, I think it's his editor over there, so I'll do anything for Doug Monies

97
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Never even read the magazine, but for Doug I'll do anything

98
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Yeah, and then the phone calls just came in, it started at, oh man, it started like at five o'clock and did not cease until almost midnight

99
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
So I'm sorry

100
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Very adamant, you've passed some sending it, again, I didn't realize after

101
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,040
Calling you earlier today that if timing works out

102
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,040
My info for episode 613, which I hope very much that you got

103
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Will end up being for a football Friday episode

104
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:46,040
I see this is why I just feel so bad is because you've got to put the sentence episode 613 opener

105
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,040
In a long time ago, and he was kind of expecting it to fit with the football Friday

106
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,040
And there I go, I'm messed them all up

107
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
I'll use it on Monday though, I promise

108
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,040
I'm making it all of our property to say, it's got lots of room

109
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,040
I've never bought a bunch of loneses

110
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,040
I hope you got that

111
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
I'm looking for that

112
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,040
I like that, man, it's your bunch of loneses, everybody, it's a football Friday

113
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,040
And so, keep up the great work, and we look forward to seeing you again, stay excited

114
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Stay clean, fashion healthy, oh and make up in

115
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Make up in?

116
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
And before, of course, fall over

117
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
Yeah, make up out!

118
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
I'll show you a bunch of loneses, everybody

119
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
I'm going to go listen, do I have a 613

120
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Some here somewhere here, let me see

121
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
I may have an already in the archives

122
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Anyway, if you think that was bad

123
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Oh man, I messed up so bad a couple of days ago

124
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Remember, I was talking about Ziggy Marley appearing on Dawn and Drew

125
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
And day viewing his brand new single

126
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Into the groove

127
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
I played promos and

128
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Yeah, look, I'm just a guy here producing this thing by myself

129
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
So, I play that, you know, well, it was a weird

130
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Dawn and Drew were on bone

131
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
So, I'm talking about Dawn and Drew, how they're going to do this

132
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Or how that I thought they probably even did this whole big thing with Ziggy Marley

133
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
Because I look for Ziggy Marley on the Poncek music network

134
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
And the track was there

135
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,040
It was just available to be found by search and guess what

136
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,040
It was, yeah, it was supposed to be available to be found by search

137
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
It was already put into our system so we could roll out

138
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
You know, we've got a whole content management system

139
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
That allows

140
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Once an assets are in, then you can put it on the homepage

141
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
You can rotate things

142
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
We really want to promote this interview

143
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
And the fact that the Marley family

144
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,040
And please note that Rita owns everything Bob's done

145
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,040
She has the power to put this stuff on the Poncek music network

146
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,040
So, for the Marley family and Ziggy in particular to put out

147
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Their music on the Poncek music network and to entrust

148
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Their art

149
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
And their livelihood

150
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
To us podcasts

151
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
Of course, phenomenal

152
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
And highly appreciated

153
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
And of course, the only thing we had to promise

154
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Was that the song would not be played before June 1st

155
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
There I go, I just pick it up

156
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Totally our bad, totally messed it up

157
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,040
May it call, but putting the hand to my own chest there

158
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
I really messed that up

159
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,040
However, the song is now, of course, officially available on the Poncek music network

160
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
It is exclusive to the PMN

161
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
You can hear it, you can play it in your show

162
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
And of course, if you go to dawn on do.com

163
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
That's where you will hear the interview

164
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
And it was painful for me to listen to this interview

165
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Because my girlfriend Don was really coming on to Ziggy, man

166
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
That was just Tom

167
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Friday, full bar Friday, maximum music, of course

168
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
We go over to the garden state where we find

169
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
The lawyer with the cars

170
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
When he's not chasing ambulances

171
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
He's the official musical

172
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
To make a motion

173
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,040
To practice for the loud

174
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,040
To make a motion

175
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,040
To make a motion

176
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
To turn his roll around

177
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:13,040
And it's a full bar Friday

178
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,040
With tells me time that you're on it

179
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,040
It's a full bar Friday

180
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,040
Yo, what's up Adam Man, how's it going?

181
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
It's Jersey Todd, your official musical

182
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
The shot shot

183
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Dude, dude, I love it

184
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Love it, love it when a band puts only one song up on the pot safe music network

185
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
Because you know it says to me one thing

186
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
That they're testing it out, that they're trying it out

187
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
See how it's going to work out for them

188
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,040
But you know, you know that they're going to put their best song up their first

189
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
And that's exactly what I think is happening with the band

190
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Luma out of Oklahoma

191
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
I love this song that I'm going to play for you

192
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
It's really really just stuck in my head

193
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
The band is just a hard rock and bunch of guys

194
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
And 80s kind of sound to them, not really

195
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
It's kind of an updated sound

196
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
But I just dig it, there's something really really great about it

197
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Check this out, the band is called Luma

198
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
The song is called Wake Up

199
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
And I know you're going to dig it on a full bar Friday

200
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040

201
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,040

224
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
like an event.

225
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Let's go and down in the archives.

226
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,600
Still to come on today's maximum music Fubar Friday, Fubar of course stands for fucked

227
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
up beyond all repair.

228
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,160
We've got to exercise with the adorable Amy Mack trying to firm up my ass and back

229
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,480
by popular demand and under new legislation, young pull that's hit test.

230
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,840
Don't be skipping forward, just stay right where you are because there's plenty

231
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,480
of good stuff to come.

232
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Yeah.

233
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Hi, is that the escort service?

234
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
Yeah.

235
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Cool.

236
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
Okay.

237
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
My name is Adam Currie.

238
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,480
I was calling in to see what type of girl you have in there.

239
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Right.

240
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
Now, there's three in there.

241
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
She changed it for 30.

242
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Okay.

243
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Cool.

244
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,080
Because last time I went there, I really had a great time, but I got to tell you, it kind

245
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,480
of sucked a little too much for my taste.

246
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Okay.

247
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
It's too much sucking.

248
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,480
So, I'm looking for something that suck less.

249
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
What do I mean?

250
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Hey, everyone.

251
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,880
This is Yazif from the Scam Tunes podcast and not everybody likes it when it sucks too much.

252
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
So help us suck less.

253
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Just visit the suckless zone.

254
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,480
That's suckless.pacho.com and help us suck less.

255
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
I love it, man.

256
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
It's going in rotation.

257
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,760
If you're a listener, if you're a producer of podcast or send a man, we'll put him in

258
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
rotation.

259
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,760
We've already, I think today, it should start.

260
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,760
We've swapped, we have like five new suckless promos coming on and let me just reiterate

261
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:21,880
that the suckless zone is the opportunity for you to join a panel and in research

262
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:29,000
when you're researching products or services, or in this case podcasting, in general and

263
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,760
in a pod show, in particular, and even more focus on certain shows and advertisers.

264
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,560
If you are on a panel, then you will be subject, and I'm saying it, you will be subject

265
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:47,000
to surveys, like I think one a month or something, and there will be new forms of advertising

266
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,960
that it's almost like have you ever been asked to preview a movie or to, yeah, the preview

267
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,960
movie is a good analogy.

268
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,000
So you'll be hearing, there'll be audio that you'll have to respond to, there will be video

269
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,880
that you'll be responding to, and all the while you're actually going to make advertising

270
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,600
suckless, you're going to make podcasting suckless because this information will be aggregated,

271
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:15,040
will be published, it will be shared, a lot of the insight, excuse me, his title ppm is still

272
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,880
sponsoring NGB because if not, they just got a freebie from me.

273
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,800
So you know, become a part of the super panel.

274
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,680
There's a small incentive where you can, you get points for each survey, you complete,

275
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,800
and you can, you can get stuff, some valuable stuff, I might add.

276
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,200
But really helping us suckless, helping the show, you listen to suckless, and one of the

277
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,240
things we learn right off the bat is, well, the one minute promo, a lot of people thought

278
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,800
that sucked, we're making that suckless, and there's other things as well.

279
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,240
Hi, I'm Paul Parkinson, just ringing, just listening to DSC this morning, talking about

280
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,360
the podcast, suckless, and I, too, have tried to get into the podcast, suckless, but I

281
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,720
would think I was a bit more successful, I actually got to the part of the system where

282
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,080
I was allowed to tell you where I am, unfortunately, the two choices are United States

283
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,920
America or other, so being in the UK, I pressed other, and it told me to go away and come

284
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
back another time.

285
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,520
When are we going to be able to play, too?

286
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
Cheers.

287
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Yeah.

288
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,320
Actually, you know, when we were testing this whole thing, I went through the survey as

289
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,680
well, and I'm always the guy that comes up with the stuff that doesn't work from other

290
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
countries.

291
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,600
And so I was like, I had the same reaction, like, other, the hell was that?

292
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,920
So you know that the surveys are done with an official third party, so it doesn't actually

293
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,000
run on our systems.

294
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,160
And I've found that a lot of these official companies who do this stuff and are trusted

295
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,960
third party, they're very web 1.0, I would have to say, because for them, this is also

296
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,920
relatively new, they've been doing surveys for a long time.

297
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,640
We're working with E-pole on this, and, and of course, we're making the whole suckless

298
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,920
zone, suckless at the same time, so we do say that this is for US only, the reason being

299
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,920
that this first survey is only for US respondents, and there was no way for our partner

300
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:22,280
in this E-pole, which was disappointing, I agree, to segregate that out with other countries.

301
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,440
And also the advertisements that we'll be running in subsequent surveys are for the US

302
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,640
market only.

303
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,280
Other countries going to get the play, yes, of course.

304
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,680
So I totally agree that that's a disappointment, but you will get to play, but it's going

305
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,440
to be at least six to eight weeks, I think, before everyone's ready to handle other

306
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,200
countries.

307
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,240
You know what, we haven't done this in a long time, hold on a second, where is it?

308
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,240
What's playing on?

309
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,440
Adults first, and I find it perfect for a footballer Friday, this is where I grab my first

310
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
generation iPod.

311
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,320
It's one of those thick ones, it doesn't hold quite as many songs and looks nothing

312
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
like an iPhone.

313
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,960
However, it does have my entire collection from the illegal Napster days, it's from the

314
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,080
first days when we were beginning with podcasting, and you never know what's going to

315
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,280
come rolling out of this thing, so today I'm not going to put it on the Friday playlist,

316
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,880
I'm just going to let it go completely around, haven't seen what we show up with, coming

317
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,440
off of Adam's first gen iPod.

318
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:38,880
What's this?

319
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:48,880
I love the high quality sound of it, I don't know what this is, this is on my iPod.

320
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Oh, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom.

321
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:35,200
Oh, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension

322
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,880
ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat

323
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, of course, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, the fifth dimension ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, the fifth dimension

324
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:34,880
ever about it, Shabbat Shalom, and we still die of oil. The left side and the left side are the power manufactured in circumventines and are the rest of the other parts.

325
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,880
Where are you?

326
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,880
Where are you?

327
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Where are you?

328
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Where are you?

329
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,880
Where are you?

330
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:18,880
I'm telling you, that a sunshine

331
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:26,880
Bear the sunshine in the sunshine

332
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Bear the sunshine in the sunshine

333
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,880
I'm telling you, that a sunshine in the sunshine

334
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,920
Bear the sunshine in the sunshine

335
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,840
Bear the sunshine in the sunshine

336
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,160
Bear the sunshine in the sunshine

337
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,880
Bear the sunshine in the sunshine in the sunshine

338
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Bear the sunshine in the sunshine

339
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Bear the sunshine in the sunshine

340
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,240
Bear the sunshine in the sunshine

341
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,520
Bear the sunshine in the sunshine

342
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,520
I'm talking about the moon.

343
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Just wanna be a home.

344
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,520
To shine on you, you got me in it.

345
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,520
I'm so proud you got me in it.

346
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
I'm so proud you got me in it.

347
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,520
I'm so proud you got me in it.

348
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,520
I'm so proud you got me in it.

349
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,520
I'm so proud you got me in it.

350
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,520
All right, I'll be in not have a smile on your face.

351
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,520
I have to be hearing that song.

352
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,520
And Jesus Christ superstar at the soundtrack.

353
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,520
By the way, you just don't hear the song.

354
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
I'm the radio anymore.

355
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Ever.

356
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,520
And a shout out to Kiri Akras, Lily Kakas from Athens.

357
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,520
Well, I know who likes this song.

358
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,520
All right, so I've started a new organization.

359
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,520
I don't have a website up yet or anything.

360
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
The organization is called the organization.

361
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:11,520
The organization for preservation of the soundtrack of our life.

362
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
And I feel this is a very important.

363
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,520
This organization is going to do very important work.

364
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Right now it only has one task or one goal in mind,

365
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,520
which is the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives.

366
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,520
Which, of course, is slowly withering away due to the fact

367
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,520
that these songs, the soundtrack to our lives is just not played on the short playlist radio

368
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
that we have.

369
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,520
Of course, these songs are also rarely, if ever played an alternative media,

370
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,520
such as podcasts, and they've become unaffordable to play on streaming web radio.

371
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,520
However, under the Fair Use Act, the organization for preservation to the soundtrack of our life

372
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,520
has concluded that it is possible for us to bring you a weekly hit test.

373
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,520
Use by the one and only young poet to help preserve that soundtrack to our lives.

374
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,520
Now, of course, you won't hear these songs in their entirety.

375
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,520
Your memory will be jogged just a little bit by a snippet.

376
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,520
You'll have an opportunity to race the clock and compete against me to see if you can guess which songs they are.

377
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Then you'll hear the answer to pay off.

378
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
You feel good about these songs.

379
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,520
And perhaps, as has been proven over and over again,

380
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,520
you will head off to iTunes or the music store of your choice to go purchase the track.

381
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,520
And perhaps other tracks at the same time.

382
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Now, I believe we're setting up hittest.podshow.com.

383
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Young poet is fully on board with this.

384
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Now, young, of course, puts a lot of energy into these hit tests.

385
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Please do not take likely the amount of work it takes to produce this.

386
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,520
Particularly, you know, making the answers sound kind of good by chopping the songs together.

387
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
And it's work.

388
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
So, young's got to get paid.

389
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
And we're trying something new here.

390
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,520
We start today with our premier sponsor of the hittest.

391
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Hittest number 72 brought to you by state farm insurance.

392
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
And let me tell you about state farm.

393
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
I've always had state farm insurance.

394
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
I don't know why.

395
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
I could sing that jingle.

396
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
You know, like a good neighbor.

397
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
State farm is there.

398
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,520
And all I can say is I've never had a problem.

399
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,520
We've had our scrapes, our bumps, our nicks, our little,

400
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,520
well, I've had some accidents.

401
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Patricia never has.

402
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
I've never had a problem with them.

403
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,520
I really like the kind of like the familiar neighborhood agent you can go to

404
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,520
when there's something you need to take care of.

405
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,520
So, without further ado, thanks to state farm and the organization for

406
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,520
preservation to the soundtrack of our lives.

407
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Here is young, put it with the hittest.

408
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
Hey, Adam.

409
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:54,520
We'll let with the 72nd edition of the hittest for the daily source code.

410
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Well, not much has changed.

411
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,520
The intros are very short.

412
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,520
Two of them are around half a second to one.

413
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,520
It's a little bit longer, but under a second.

414
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,520
And the intros are even shorter than usual.

415
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
They're around 30 seconds.

416
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,520
So, extensive editing had to be done to accomplish that.

417
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,520
And therefore, singing along may cause some problems.

418
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
I'll give it some problems.

419
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
I'll give it some problems.

420
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
So, please don't do that.

421
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Roll it out.

422
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Why is my force so low?

423
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
Oh, yeah.

424
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
You might ask, what?

425
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
And that's due to some hay fever stuff.

426
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
It can be helped.

427
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
That's what they're all doing.

428
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Next time, it will be better.

429
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
All righty.

430
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
Three intros.

431
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Let's go.

432
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Let's go.

433
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
What?

434
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:45,520
I got to think about it.

435
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,520
No, it's true, maybe.

436
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,520
Oh, I know that one.

437
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,520
That's a give away.

438
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,520
That is Miami-Saramachine.

439
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
Do the Congo.

440
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,520
Yeah, do the Congo.

441
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,520
And the final one is number three.

442
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
Huh, huh.

443
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Yon, how can I not know this one?

444
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,520
This is from my pirate radio days.

445
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Brooklyn Bronx and Queen's band, BB and Q, with on the beat.

446
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Well, that's it.

447
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
That's all you got.

448
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
I think it is.

449
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
He's answering number one.

450
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,520
What was one?

451
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
From 1977.

452
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
It's Leo Sam.

453
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
You got to know it.

454
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
I was right.

455
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
Stand in here.

456
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
I belong with you.

457
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Wonderful.

458
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,520
It is that I'm supposed to do.

459
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,520
I live under in my heart.

460
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,520
But I just can't control.

461
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,520
I live under in my heart.

462
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,520
But I just don't know.

463
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Oh, unbelievable.

464
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
From one to another.

465
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,520
I'm still going strong this second.

466
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,520
Leo Sayer and Thunder in my heart is answering number one.

467
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,520
And this is number two.

468
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,520
From 1986.

469
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
The Miami Sound Machine.

470
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
This is Kanga.

471
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
From 86.

472
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Gloria Stefan and the Miami Sound Machine in Kanga.

473
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
And this is number three.

474
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,520
Charlemagne.

475
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,520
Charlemagne and night to remember.

476
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Shit.

477
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
I'm wrong.

478
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
I can't believe I had a wrong.

479
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
I thought it was BB and Q band.

480
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:54,520
The song for which I had to do the most extensive editing.

481
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,520
Charlemagne from 1982 and a night to remember.

482
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,520
Well, that's it for I hit this number 72.

483
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,520
I hope you hadn't done all of them.

484
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,520
They were not really too difficult, I think.

485
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,520
Well, until next time, maybe next week.

486
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,520
And well, until then, take care.

487
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
I have fun and see you later.

488
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
Bye-bye.

489
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
Thank you.

490
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
I will do it all over again.

491
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Next week.

492
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,520
I was convinced it was the BB and Q band.

493
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,520
I think that's the maybe that I was confused with the theme song you use.

494
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
Oh, wow.

495
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
That felt good.

496
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Did you guys sing along?

497
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
You feel good?

498
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
Do you feel like you need to...

499
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
Oh, I know what we need.

500
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,520
Let me open up the other mic here.

501
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:54,520
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

502
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
Hey, Adam, it's Amy Mack.

503
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Hello.

504
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
I love these music Fridays.

505
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,520
That's the perfect upbeat mood for exercise.

506
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
Don't you think?

507
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
Hi, great.

508
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Let's do some.

509
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
All right. Are you ready?

510
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Yeah, well, tell me what to do.

511
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,520
We're going to start standing tall standing tall.

512
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Same forward.

513
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Four low shoulders back, stomach tight and hold your arms out to the side.

514
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Arms out to the side.

515
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,520
Now lift your right leg out to the right and bend your knee to 90 degrees

516
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,520
and lift it as high as you can without leaning or falling over.

517
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,520
Oh.

518
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,520
Hold it.

519
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
Okay.

520
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,520
Yeah.

521
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
Squeeze.

522
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,520
And now swing it around and cross it in front of you as far as it'll go.

523
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Now back and forth five more times and then switch sides.

524
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,520
Okay.

525
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,520
Really use your abs and your posture to keep balance.

526
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
Okay.

527
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
Breathe.

528
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
I always forget that part.

529
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,520
Also looking at the same spot in front of you will help keep you upright.

530
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
All right. That's like helicopter hovering.

531
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,520
Okay.

532
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,520
Now switch to the left leg.

533
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,520
Lift it up to the left side and then cross it in front of you.

534
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,520
Great.

535
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,520
Five more.

536
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
It feels.

537
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,520
It's a nice stretch.

538
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,520
Keep those shoulders back.

539
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Yeah.

540
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
I'm sorry.

541
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
So shut up.

542
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Breathe.

543
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
Yes.

544
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
Squeeze that butt.

545
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
Yeah.

546
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,520
Yeah.

547
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Yeah.

548
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,520
I don't think it's going to be fantastic.

549
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,520
Well, that's it for this week.

550
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
This is Amy Mack.

551
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,520
And until next time.

552
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
That's what's inside.

553
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
Yeah.

554
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,520
I feel kind of good.

555
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
You get the exercises as it's on show by the way.

556
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
If you just want to.

557
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
If you just want to firm up a little bit, you know.

558
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,520
It could happen.

559
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
You could need it.

560
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,520
Yeah.

561
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
I'm at Stoke Pilgrim in Boston.

562
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
So you're visited by two angels.

563
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
And they told you that in cannot smoke.

564
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
Gange anymore.

565
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Be aware of the eyes of September.

566
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Well, that's a bummer.

567
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
And that must give you the blues.

568
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,520
And when I've got the blues.

569
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
I want to hear blues music.

570
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,520
So I turn to the always relevant pod save music network.

571
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,520
This cut is from Big George Jackson Blues Band with Boo Boo Data

572
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Singing from Black and Ten Records.

573
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
Son, it's tell me what to do.

574
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,520
10 this one.

575
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,520
I told no.

576
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Get high.

577
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,520
It's not a deal at all.

578
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,520
My good job too.

579
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
It ain't good at all.

580
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,520
What a good boy.

581
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
Yeah.

582
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,520
What a good boy.

583
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
Yeah.

584
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,520
Yeah.

585
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,520
Yeah.

586
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,520
Yeah.

587
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,520
Great job.

588
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Oh, my good job.

589
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
Finding my job.

590
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,520
Finding my job.

591
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Nothing.

592
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,520
Oh, yeah.

593
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,520
Oh, yeah.

594
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:18,520
Oh, yeah.

595
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Oh, yeah.

596
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,520
Uh, yeah.

597
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,520
Oh, yeah.

598
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:40,520
Oh, yeah.

599
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,520
Holy good boy, that's got that good boy y'all

600
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:23,520
Holy good boy, that's got that good boy y'all

601
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:33,520
Holy good boy, that's got that good boy y'all

602
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Holy good boy, that's got that good boy y'all

603
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Yeah.

604
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
You don't need to know.

605
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
Oh, I thought you'd be alone.

606
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Yeah.

607
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Oh, that's good for you.

608
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
Oh.

609
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,520
Don't let go for your own little thing.

610
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
You've got a little on.

611
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Oh.

612
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Yeah, you've got a little on.

613
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
Yeah.

614
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
Oh.

615
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Oh, no, no, no, no.

616
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Yeah.

617
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Get a good bus.

618
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Let's go.

619
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
Let's go, man.

620
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,520
Make your Jackson Blues band.

621
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
Yeah.

622
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
Doug Griller,

623
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
the insigator of free Trinity.

624
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:31,520
You know, so I called Don and Drew actually spoke to Miss Micelli yesterday about the whole Ziggy Marley cock up that I did.

625
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,520
And she said, basically, I think she said,

626
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,520
that's okay.

627
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,520
Just give me a car, bitch.

628
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,520
Something like that.

629
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,520
So my immediate thought was maybe I could just get rid of all the hatred with,

630
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
with by pawning off Trinity.

631
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
And then I'm thinking,

632
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,520
maybe Doug, you and your kids still interested.

633
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,520
You come on out and you guys drive over to Don and Drew.

634
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
And then have the minions pick it up from there.

635
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,520
Is that a thought perhaps?

636
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
I'd love to hear from you.

637
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,520
So Adam, this is Jonathan Doe.

638
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,520
I made a long time Charlie this morning.

639
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,520
I am not running for president.

640
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,520
However, if I were, there would be a few things I'd like to say.

641
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,520
And I've got them out if I were ready for president.com.

642
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,520
And like to invite you and my fellow Charlie listeners to come up and take a look.

643
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Thanks.

644
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
Yeah, and I did that.

645
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,520
If I were president.com, you should take a look at that side.

646
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Because it's, it's nice.

647
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
I don't know.

648
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,520
It's just something about it that I thought this is an interesting way of,

649
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,520
of protesting what's happening now and what you'd like to see in your future.

650
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,520
Leader, leader of the free world and for your country.

651
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
Enjoy that a lot, dude.

652
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
If I were president.com.

653
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,520
And here's a piece of music I want to play for you that comes from YouTube.

654
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
It's been all over the Dutch papers.

655
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,520
There's a girl, a singer in the Netherlands called S.M.

656
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,520
Denters.

657
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,520
And I think she's, she's really just known from YouTube.

658
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,520
Although I think she may have done.

659
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,520
Maybe she was a contestant on, you know, pop idol or ex-factor or something.

660
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,520
I've heard the name somewhere before.

661
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,520
But there's this awesome video.

662
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,520
And it's just her standing in a recording studio.

663
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,520
And she's singing Justin Timberlake song.

664
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,520
And in fact, at one point, you actually think that she's singing along with like a karaoke version.

665
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Because you hear kind of Justin's voice going in and out.

666
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,520
I mean, I, I, there's no way to tell you this without actually spoiling.

667
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
You know, I'm not going to spoil it.

668
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,520
I want you to listen to this.

669
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,520
I'm going to listen to her singing.

670
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,520
And then at the very end, where the shot zooms out, all is revealed.

671
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
And I want you to listen to this.

672
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,520
Let me, I'm actually fired up from, from the web browser just from YouTube.

673
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,520
So this is what goes around by S.M. Denters.

674
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:23,520
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

675
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:35,520
I just can't seem to understand, though it was you and me bay, me and you, once you, the end, but I guess I was wrong.

676
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:52,520
To want to think about it, to want to talk about it, just so sick about it, can't believe it's in and is way, so confused about it, then the blues are about it, I just can't do it, don't you tell me if it's fair, is it so waste, really going down?

677
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,520
Is this how we say goodbye, babe?

678
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:03,520
I shouldn't know better when you came around, but you were going to make me cry,

679
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,520
I was breaking my heart to watch you run around, and that you live in a lie,

680
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:18,520
But that's okay, babe, because in time you will find what goes around goes around goes around,

681
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,520
and on others all the way, that carau,

682
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,520
What goes around goes aroundods around lambs all the way, that carau,

683
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:41,520
Who goes around goes around baby, he goes around with Where man crown of a woman crown,

684
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,520
Back around

685
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,520
Hey

686
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,520
What goes around baby

687
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,520
Comes around baby

688
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,520
Back around

689
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,520
Hey

690
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,520
What goes around

691
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,520
Comes around

692
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:19,520
Back around

693
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Yeah

694
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,520
She's my son

695
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,520
She's my son better than me

696
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,520
No, that's not true

697
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
So the camera pulls out

698
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,520
And it's actually

699
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,520
Just in Timberlake playing the piano

700
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
And he was singing along

701
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,520
And she was apparently just standing there

702
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
And that gives me goosebumps

703
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,520
Man, you're just standing there singing

704
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,520
Timberlake song

705
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,520
Just the piano

706
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,520
And her in the studio

707
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,520
It's just phenomenal

708
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,520
And this thing is off the hook

709
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,520
It's got like a million views

710
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,520
But it's awesome

711
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,520
Really really cool

712
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,520
Highlight error

713
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
Highlight error

714
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,520
Highlight error

715
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
To me, who's this big

716
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,520
Good luckings

717
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,520
And over is me

718
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,520
But just try to worry

719
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,520
Just met him at the podcast

720
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,520
Day 2006 last year

721
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,520
But that's not the topic

722
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,520
I won't jump into this

723
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,520
Wherever locate the put show

724
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
HR stuff kind of

725
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,520
Discussion, Colone

726
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,520
Just love Berlin, Munich, Hamburg

727
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,520
But there was a statement

728
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,520
In the Charlie's 610 of

729
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,520
Johannes and

730
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,520
I want to try to play this again

731
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,520
Might be something

732
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,520
And Johannes

733
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,520
Colone would be the perfect location for the German

734
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,520
Pontchurch queue

735
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,520
Very big in all kinds of media

736
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,520
And it's a very nice city which is often described

737
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,520
As Italy's northern most city

738
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,520
I like the sound of that

739
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,520
Oh no, Johannes

740
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,520
I'm really not a big patriotic kind of guy

741
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,520
But you know that Munich is

742
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Known as Italians

743
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,520
Most northern city, not even Colone

744
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,520
You do, you do have your fun on your own

745
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,520
And you may be a big media city

746
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,520
As we are

747
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,520
Immunic

748
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,520
But I want to just

749
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,520
Get this clear for the

750
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,520
Listeners of the Charlie

751
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,520
If you want to live a Italian style in Germany

752
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,520
You have to go to Munich

753
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,520
So wherever you plane will take you

754
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,520
You will come

755
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,520
But just please

756
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,520
Keep on trying

757
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
Sucking less with the Pontchurch

758
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,520
I tell them

759
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,520
Dude, you got some pipes there

760
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,520
You should do a couple of drops for the show

761
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,520
I don't know

762
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,520
I love the resonance of your voice

763
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,520
Record something, send the to me

764
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,520
Show me how to suck less

765
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,520
Ernie

766
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,520
Says Adam the best place in Germany is outside Germany

767
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,520
Namely in Switzerland

768
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,520
One of the most liberal and competitive economies in the world

769
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,520
No wonder a Google set up their major European offices in Zurich

770
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,520
Even more and more German companies move to Switzerland recently for good reasons

771
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
Adam moved

772
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,520
Podschot a Zurich and do the German market

773
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,520
From here I promise you

774
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,520
Will remember my words once the German bureaucracy and tax officers are after you

775
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,520
Ha ha ha ha ha

776
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,520
I don't scare me

777
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,520
Randy

778
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,520
Randy C. Sturgel

779
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,520
Says Heidelberg is the only place in Germany

780
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,520
In Germany deserving to be your headquarters period

781
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,520
End of discussion

782
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,520
Tell me this is off the hook

783
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,520
I'm getting a lot of these

784
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,520
So this is who is this from?

785
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,520
Frank Jonas, Frank Syregulner

786
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,520
Make sure that you don't think it's going to be easy to get a DSL line

787
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,520
It's not ubiquitous

788
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
Our landlines are operated by Inbecils

789
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,520
Deutsch telecom

790
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,520
Probably the single most ideal company in the world

791
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,520
Oh, that's nice

792
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,520
Er

793
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,520
Let's see

794
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,520
Is that what he's suggesting?

795
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,520
Here's another one from Munich who is this from Michelle

796
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,520
Oh from whispered pearls

797
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,520
Munich Adam have Podschot Germany immunity

798
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,520
Not only because that's my sister's base of operations

799
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,520
Well, that's a fine reason right there Michelle

800
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,520
But that also is where all the cool RT people are

801
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,520
They're centers there for film TV radio all sorts of old media

802
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,520
Munich would be the first choice Berlin would be the second

803
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
I'll see if I can get my sister to weigh in on this as well

804
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,520
Wow

805
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,520
Okay, but that's kind of cheating

806
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,520
What's that?

807
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,520
Is that all it?

808
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,520
Oh, here's oh my goodness

809
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,520
This is probably from Alex again

810
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,520
Oh, and he's got like a whole, you know, a whole sheet of a whole ratings sheet

811
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,520
This is this is much appreciated

812
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
Oh, I think we have to do a tour

813
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,520
We should probably do it we didn't in the UK

814
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,520
We should do a

815
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Well, I guess we'll have to do a couple of meat and greets right drafts and darts

816
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
So what will it be?

817
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,520
The

818
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,520
That's not cool enough. Hey, let's come up with a couple locations couple ideas

819
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,520
I'd like to check out Munich

820
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,520
I'd like to check out what else did we have on the radar

821
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,520
A clone was on the radar

822
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,520
Berlin is on the radar, and I believe Hamburg is still just on the radar

823
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,520
All right, I got two more songs for you

824
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,520
This is one that cheers you up to guests

825
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,520
In the guys actually from Jersey

826
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,520
This name is Steve Robinson

827
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,520
Class clown

828
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,520
He's from Florida

829
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
He's from Florida

830
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,520
He's from Florida

831
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,520
He's from Florida

832
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,520
He's from Florida

833
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,520
He's from Florida

834
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,520
He's from Florida

835
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,520
He's from Florida

836
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,520

879
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,520
He's from Florida

880
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,520
He's from Florida

881
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,520
They're storming to be known

882
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,520
I need to be excused and possibly stay there

883
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,520
Because that I got stuck on you

884
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,520
And then I came and blew it

885
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,520
And now we're separated

886
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,520
And I can't stand this

887
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,520
And I can't sleep

888
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,520
Because you don't see me and hell high

889
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,520
And you don't think me

890
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,520
You don't know why

891
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,520
I am smiling, looks like down

892
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,520
Offer down to the last one

893
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,520
Teach us that I'm not

894
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,520
But I have a God, a good obsession

895
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,520
And then I'll let you know

896
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,520
I'll get on you

897
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:11,520
Teach us that I'm just this

898
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,520
Steve Robinson

899
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,520
This is influences as Neil Finn Richard Thompson

900
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,520
The Beatles, Neil Young, XTC

901
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,520
And Crosby Still's Nation Young

902
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,520
And he used to play with Roger McWinn

903
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,520
I guess it's the guy from the birds, right?

904
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:40,520
Hey, this is Tracarton from Tracartonpodcast.com

905
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,520
Podshow needs you to help us suck less

906
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:49,520
Just go to suckless.podshow.com for complete details

907
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,520
Angie B sent me a note

908
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,520
And I love it when she starts off with a baby

909
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,520
And she sent me a picture, nude picture

910
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,520
Since this is me seated with my German girlfriend

911
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,520
Christiana

912
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,520
Back when I had black hair

913
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,520
Just got the next scan that thought I'd share

914
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,520
By the way, thanks for playing my online promo the other day

915
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,520
And then she sent me a track off of her

916
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,520
A new CD coming out October 2007

917
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,520
Love Spirals, of course with Ryan

918
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,520
I didn't know this song was anonymous, which makes it

919
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,520
Almost by default pod safe

920
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,520
It's the motherless child

921
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,520
And you'll know the song

922
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,520
You'll love the way Angie laid it down

923
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,520
Love Spirals

924
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:56,520
Sometimes I feel like a mother's child

925
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:06,520
Sometimes I feel like a mother's child

926
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:16,520
Sometimes I feel like a mother's child

927
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:26,520
But not the ways from home

928
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:36,520
But not the ways from home

929
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:44,520
Sometimes I feel like a mother's child

930
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:56,520
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone

931
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:06,520
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone

932
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:17,520
And I'm always alone

933
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:27,520
And I'm always alone

934
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:42,520
So I feel like I'm almost gone

935
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:55,520
And I'm always alone

936
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:00,520
I love spirals, muddleless child on a maximum music

937
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,520
Football Friday

938
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:08,520
It's Friday

939
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:14,520
Well, it starts up in pretty much focused on one thing smoking

940
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,520
And how much I'd like to do it

941
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,520
But I'm not

942
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,520
And it gets obsessive

943
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,520
And I try to distract myself and eat something

944
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,520
And it just makes it worse

945
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,520
But what I'm noticing is I've got a great support network

946
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,520
And that's really you guys

947
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,520
And people in the house here they've all heard this quick and stuff before

948
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,520
So they just try to be supported

949
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,520
But they don't really want to say anything

950
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,520
They don't want to catch me in the wrong mood

951
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,520
They're smart

952
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,520
But I really do appreciate all of the emails and the audio comments

953
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,520
And voice mail that people in the calling in with

954
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,520
That's really nice

955
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,520
It really does help

956
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,520
And I do feel much better

957
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,520
What do we know?

958
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,520
I haven't counted this time

959
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,520
Which I think is probably better

960
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,520
And I'm in week two somewhere

961
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,520
It's just those certain moments

962
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,520
Particularly the moments that I share with you guys

963
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,520
When I'm doing the shows

964
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,520
When I want to smoke the most

965
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,520
So having you sitting there

966
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,520
Yelling back at me

967
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,520
To not do it

968
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,520
It's really helpful

969
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,520
So I'm going to try and be supported for someone else

970
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,520
Who's doing something difficult

971
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,520
I'm not sure what and I'm probably doing some of that already somewhere

972
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,520
But I'm going to make a conscious effort

973
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,520
Because it really does make this whole world kind of work

974
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,520
Doesn't it?

975
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,520
So that's it

976
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,520
The final thought of the week

977
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:42,520
Okay, here's the plan

978
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,520
Tomorrow I take the lady Patricia to the lowlands

979
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,520
Dropping her off in Amsterdam

980
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,520
She has a live TV show on Sunday, Sunday afternoon

981
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,520
So I will be flying out

982
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,520
Whether permitting of course on Monday

983
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,520
To Antwerp pick up the good old wing commander

984
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,520
We'll come back

985
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,520
We'll pick up Patricia on the way back

986
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,520
And then he's going to take the aircraft back

987
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,520
To Antwerp to take it to the radio shop

988
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,520
Because we definitely have a problem with the radios

989
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,520
And I want it fixed

990
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,520
And since I'm going away

991
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,520
I think I'm in New York Tuesday morning

992
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,520
I have a really early morning flight out

993
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,520
I'm going to be in New York for the rest of the week

994
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,520
And then I think off to San Francisco in the weekend

995
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,520
So I will be on the road for a considerable

996
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,520
A considerable amount of time

997
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,520
And I hope you join me along the way

998
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,520
Oh, by the way
