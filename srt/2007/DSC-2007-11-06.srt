00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yo, what's Tony Costa telling you to check out this Christmas podcast.com is the official podcast for the new Sony film this Christmas

exclusive interviews from the stars in the film and a special red carpet coverage from the premiere.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You can exchange gifts, but you can't exchange family. This Christmas is truly the next holiday classy.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
See it in theaters on November 21st and check us out at thisChristmaspodcast.com.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We're here on the streets of San Francisco trying to hunt down one of America's most wanted

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,600
Adam Curry. He's wanted by the TSA, by the FBI, by the CIA, by the ATF, for carrying various forms of

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,000
hairspray across the United States, and also by a man in Hoboken New Jersey who went to college

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
with Mr. Curry, and says he suspects that the man has been listening to too much array game music.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The suspect is approximately 8 feet tall. He has very tall bushy blonde hair and walks around in rose-colored glasses.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If you happen to see Mr. Curry, please help us stop him before he records the DSC 682.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, today I arrive at San Francisco International Airport. Had a nice little chat with the

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
customs officers.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's go. I go through to get my suitcase. Five minutes after I'm standing there, the same

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
guy had apparently come running from his little cute little there.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How do I have your cross-miss form for a second?

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I got to write something on it.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And he writes on it, baggage check, baggage check.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And I say, oh, oh, why is that? Did you just always on the side you wanted to check?

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I'm popped up in the computer.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm on the list.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I am on the list.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I am most definitely on the list.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And I'm not quite sure what it is, but it's not a pretty one because I am going to get ripped apart

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
every single time I come into the states.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now, there's something really seriously fucked up because what's happening here.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So I'm popped up in the computer.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
All of this talk that we've been having about the constitution and a skull

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
fucked up rotting corpse of the TSA.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm on the list.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh yes, skull fucked up rotting corpse of the TSA.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't leave you fear of what I say.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Enjoy your freedom.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Remember, remember the fifth of November,

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the gunpowder creasant and blood.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I know of no reason why the gunpowder creasant should ever be forgotten.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm on the list.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm on the list.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm on the list.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm on the list.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm on the list.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm on the list.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm on the list.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm on the list.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm on the list.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm on the list.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm on the list.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm on the list.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm on the list.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm on the list.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm on the list.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I am on the list.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm on the list.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm on the list.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm on the list.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm on the list.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm on the list.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm on the list.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm on the list.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm on the list.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is the second stoneienia굴點ий

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120
from the World tradition

66
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:11,120
It's an illusion, a bunch of confusion

67
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:19,120
The only solution, a new revolution

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,120
A new revolution

69
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Corporations making billions selling us their lives

70
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Make a profit even if nobody's left alive

71
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,120
The new world earner is the devil disguise

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,120
With the television news set to hypnotize

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,120
When the bureaucratic power tips get the grip

74
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Should we see through the grip of sound

75
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Got a stop and lay and got

76
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Oh, our prosecution never made your institutions

77
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
Stepping on the Constitution

78
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Let's sign a revolution

79
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Let's sign a revolution freedom

80
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
It ain't free

81
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
If they take our rights

82
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Then we've got to fight for our democracy

83
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Yeah

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Let's have a sitting on the White House lawn

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,120
A sitting on the White House lawn

86
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,720
Let's have a sitting on the White House lawn

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,120
A sitting on the White House lawn

88
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Let's have a sitting on the White House lawn

89
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,120
A noer, a sitting on the White House lawn

90
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
I'll be out.

91
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,120
Let's have a sitin' on the White House long.

92
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,120
I knew ever seen it on the White House long.

93
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,120
The only solution.

94
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,120
I knew ever you should.

95
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,120
Freedom people, new revolution.

96
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,120
Kicking off episode number 682 of the daily source code.

97
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Hey everybody, how you doing?

98
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Officially still the fifth of November.

99
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Of course you're probably listening to this on November 6th.

100
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,120
What we need right now is a clear message to the people of this country.

101
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,120
This message must be read in every newspaper heard on every radio scene on every television.

102
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,120
This message must presound throughout the entire interlink.

103
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,120
I want this country to realize that we stand on the edge of oblivion.

104
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,120
I want every man, woman, and child to understand how close we are to chaos.

105
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,120
I want everything to remember why they need them.

106
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
I got to tell you.

107
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,120
As fried as I am, and of course it's been a very busy couple of days.

108
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Happy to tell you all about it.

109
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,120
I've had a smirk on my face all day.

110
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Starting last night, midnight.

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,120
Because the 24-hour period of the Ron Paul Money Bomb, which of course was to coincide

112
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
with the fifth of November.

113
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Handily, virally propagated through the V-Vendetta.

114
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,120
I remember remember the fifth of November gunpowder trees and implot.

115
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,120
Of course borrowed from our British friends.

116
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Wow.

117
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Can you believe it?

118
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
So I'm looking now.

119
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
What time is it here?

120
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,120
It is now a 930pm on the fifth of November.

121
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,120
I'm looking at the scorecard right now.

122
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,120
7,150,312 dollars in the 79 cents.

123
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Raised so far in the quarter for Ron Paul.

124
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Last night.

125
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Before I went to bed.

126
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,120
At midnight, it was 2.3 million.

127
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,120
So I think by midnight, Pacific Standard Time,

128
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,120
$5 million will have been raised for Congressman Dr. Ron Paul.

129
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Just Dr. Ron.

130
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Da.

131
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Thank you all.

132
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Everyone who was participated.

133
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Everyone who put money into the pot.

134
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,120
You're investing in the future of America.

135
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
You're investing in your freedom.

136
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Even if this candidate doesn't make it all the way to the White House,

137
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,120
the message is out, the message is very clear.

138
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
And you know what?

139
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,120
It's such a relatively small percentage of people that made this happen.

140
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
It may be 40, 50,000 people.

141
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Actually, I think Jonathan, the campaign finance director,

142
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
will give me some stats.

143
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
I think it was pretty busy today.

144
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,120
I did have an email or two back and forth with them.

145
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,120
But I think it will give me some stats on how much money we raised

146
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
through DSC.

147
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,120
I'm certainly curious because the number in total was really,

148
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
I think, only 40, 50,000 people.

149
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Which means that not only will the candidate get more visibility,

150
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,120
but we can always drop another money bomb whenever we need it.

151
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
It's really not all that hard to do.

152
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
This is just beautiful.

153
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,120
For me, today was it really showed something special.

154
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,120
And maybe it only works if you're American and you're kind of in the American system.

155
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,120
And you are realized that it's very important for a candidate to be able to raise lots of money

156
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,120
because I said it before, I gotta say it again.

157
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,120
We choose our presidents the same way we choose our washing powder

158
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,120
through repetition of commercials.

159
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,120
It's just an extremely important part of any campaign in this country and this system.

160
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
But man, man or man.

161
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
And you know what?

162
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
No celebrity.

163
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
No Oprah was needed.

164
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,120
What are Oprah raised for Obama?

165
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Like one $2 million that she invited everyone to her house.

166
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
We didn't need any super celebrity.

167
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
No one's the celebrity of this.

168
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Except for the constitution and freedom.

169
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Man, it feels good to say that.

170
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
You know what?

171
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,120
Let's loosen up a little bit.

172
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,120
I need some exercise or is it an ass or size?

173
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Come on, Amy.

174
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
I need some ferman of the buttocks.

175
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Hey, Amy.

176
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Hey, Adam, remember me?

177
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Yeah.

178
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,120
It's Amy, man.

179
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Amy.

180
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,120
It seems that we are both a little overloaded when it comes to getting the recording thing done.

181
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
So I know it's been weeks since we've asked her size.

182
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
I'm right.

183
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,120
But I thought some circumstances go, you can use all that space and headroom in your apartment

184
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
and we can do something big.

185
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Go ahead and get yourself situated.

186
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Okay, I'm ready.

187
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
I'm standing socks only.

188
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
We're going to do moving jump squats.

189
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,120
So you're going to squat like you're sitting in a chair and then jump up and forward

190
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,120
while squeezing the stomach and butt.

191
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Okay.

192
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Good.

193
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Another one.

194
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,120
You want to go as high and as far as you can while still keeping your balance.

195
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,120
And of course, don't forget to breathe.

196
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,120
This time, you want to jump up and backwards.

197
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,120
And again.

198
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Good.

199
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Two more front and two more back.

200
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Ready, go.

201
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,120
I don't hear you squeezing.

202
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Breathe.

203
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
Okay.

204
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Now, I don't know what the next few weeks hold.

205
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,120
But if you're missing me, you can watch me kick Brandon's ass and the super music video show.

206
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Now, when I see it, I owe you two butt squeezes.

207
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,120
And remember, there's always time to say it with me.

208
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
So size.

209
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Okay.

210
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:10,120
I saw it in me today as I was on my way out the door at a big presentation today.

211
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,120
And she said hi.

212
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
No butt squeeze.

213
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
No nothing.

214
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,120
So I presume she's listening and was maybe even disappointed.

215
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Sorry.

216
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
I forgot to breathe.

217
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Maybe even disappointed that that hadn't done it yet.

218
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Okay.

219
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Amy.

220
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
So you owe me two butt squeezes.

221
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,120
Of course, this program emanating from the Curry condo in San Francisco, California.

222
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Man, it's been crazy three days.

223
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,120
So we had this big presentation today.

224
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,120
And it really involved a whole bunch of people in the company.

225
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Really everybody would have to say right down to forbidding anyone to download porn during

226
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,120
our demonstration of our new site because it's running on a sandbox inside the office.

227
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
And so, you know, it's all on VPN.

228
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:02,120
So when you actually play some media coming from outside, the building, it just clogs up the pipes and it complicated.

229
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,120
But everyone refrain from downloading porn this afternoon.

230
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
That was great.

231
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,120
But it was a lot of work yesterday.

232
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,120
I've been Sunday Saturday.

233
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
It was no weekend, man.

234
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
It was just crazy.

235
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,120
But I did get a lot of great comments about, I told you, I felt this won't be one for the archives.

236
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,120
And I also felt quite good.

237
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,120
I actually listened back to the entire show Saturday morning.

238
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Football.

239
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,120
I got to say, I think really added to the soundtrack of my life.

240
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Adam, this is Martin calling from David.

241
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:41,120
I heard Marilyn listening to the DSC number 681 or Friday.

242
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
The food bar Friday.

243
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:52,120
And that things to play after the hit test, the beetles thing, whatever.

244
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I want to call that thing.

245
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Mashup.

246
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Oh my god.

247
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Every single song.

248
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
I'm 40 years old.

249
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,120
I know pretty much all the songs from my youth.

250
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Not having heard them when their first came out.

251
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Every one of those songs.

252
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
I'm not even through listening to the thing.

253
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,120
I can't wait till I get home and sit in my car right now.

254
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,120
Can't wait till I get home and start finding all those songs.

255
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Wherever I can find them.

256
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,120
I just forgot how many great.

257
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Sorry.

258
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Dr. Ron.

259
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
For president.

260
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
That's what I suppose to be.

261
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Dr. Ron for president.

262
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Almost forgot.

263
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Yeah, man.

264
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
I put a Lincoln show notes to the full file.

265
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
You only heard half of it.

266
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,120
I think continues for like a total of 10 minutes.

267
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
That.

268
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,120
I was at the something versus the beetles.

269
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Geez.

270
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Gee, the geez or the breeze.

271
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
It's in the show notes for the show.

272
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Almost obscure beetle songs.

273
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,120
There are and.

274
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Dude, that was just fucking awesome.

275
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
So whoever sent that in.

276
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Like I said, I haven't looked gotten to the end of it yet.

277
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,120
But I just stopped in the middle to pick up the phone and call you.

278
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,120
And absolutely awesome.

279
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Thanks for putting that together.

280
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Putting that on the air.

281
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Yeah, of course, man.

282
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
That's what food bar is all about.

283
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,120
And when I actually have the time, which is all I wish for,

284
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
it's just a little more time in the day.

285
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
When I have the time, I got to tell you.

286
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
I so get into this shit, but that was,

287
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
I did that Thursday evening.

288
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,120
That was probably two and a half hours of preparation.

289
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Just to get everything.

290
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Find everything downloaded.

291
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,120
You know, transfer stuff over from computer to computer.

292
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,120
You know, it takes time.

293
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
So when I got the time, then.

294
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,120
That's why I'd rather not do a show than just throw something together

295
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
and why I skip a day or two.

296
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Hi, Adam.

297
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,120
It's Kevin Crossman, the proud scruncher from Frap Pack podcast.

298
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
There you go.

299
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,120
A little commentary on your last football Friday, which was really.

300
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Definitely one for the record books.

301
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Lots of great music.

302
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Although once again, jersey time.

303
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,120
But you down because that song was very generic and boring.

304
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Whereas the rest of your stuff was really inspired and.

305
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Oh, hold on a second.

306
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Easy on the toaster there.

307
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,120
You know, jersey time.

308
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,120
By the way, no easy task for this man because.

309
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
You know, he.

310
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,120
I've missed so many football Fridays that he also, you know,

311
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,120
has to like spin up inspiration within seconds when he finds out that I'm doing a show.

312
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
I like the choice personally.

313
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Otherwise, I wouldn't have played it.

314
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
You know.

315
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Although I do trust jersey Todd's opinion,

316
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Surgery as he taught official music colleges of the Chacha.

317
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,120
That's this program you're listening to.

318
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,120
So not to harsh man on the guy.

319
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
All right, please.

320
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Come on, he's family.

321
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,120
You know, maybe just wasn't your liking, but.

322
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
You're in the family.

323
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
We all kind of cooperate.

324
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,120
It's given take.

325
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,120
Regarding your experience going through security and having to show them.

326
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,120
A business card to get into the country of which you are citizen is incredibly.

327
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
Disturbing.

328
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,120
I was thinking about your vibe about, you know, thinking about gadgets again.

329
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,120
And since I'm a new iPhone owner, I thought, well,

330
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,120
couldn't you just show, you know, plot your internet tablet or whatever you're using these days.

331
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,120
Go to the pod show site and surely there would be some information that would show that you are the CEO of a.

332
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Okay.

333
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Okay.

334
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
All right.

335
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Okay.

336
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
No, but a lot of people have suggested that I record it.

337
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
So next time that's what I'm going to do, I'm going to wear my wireless mic.

338
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
I'm going to put it on.

339
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
I want to get off the plane.

340
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,120
I'll put it in my coat pocket or something.

341
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,120
And I'll record my experience because I'm guaranteed to get pulled over again.

342
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Because as you know, I'm on list.

343
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
Someone who is on many, many lists.

344
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
Some of them shit.

345
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Come extra.

346
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
Come extra.

347
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Come extra.

348
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Come extra.

349
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Come extra.

350
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Come extra.

351
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Come extra.

352
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Come extra.

353
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
Come extra.

354
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Come extra.

355
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Come extra.

356
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Come extra.

357
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Are you corresponding?

358
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Because there's a lot of shit going on in the world.

359
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Not just in the United States of America.

360
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
What's up, Adam?

361
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,120
You're a CSB, your EU co-respondent.

362
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Your EU, my friend.

363
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
So Italy is now expelink.

364
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,120
EU citizens who came from Romania.

365
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
What the fucking fuck?

366
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,120
What kind of bullshit is this?

367
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
Wait a minute.

368
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
They're expeling.

369
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,120
I guess what he's trying to say is,

370
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,120
One European country is throwing Europeans out of its country.

371
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,120
And that's not the way the rules are supposed to work.

372
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,120
It's the fucking freedom of movement gone.

373
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,120
So apparently it is legal after all.

374
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,120
If EU citizens are not the motherfuckers, then.

375
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:39,120
So Adam, better tell your bird Patricia to get fucking British citizenship as a AP.

376
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,120
Because otherwise, she, as EU citizens, can be expeled, for example, from UK.

377
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Cool.

378
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
You know what?

379
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,120
That would probably happen just because of me.

380
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Because I'm on some list somewhere.

381
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,120
I think she has to live there for a total of five years before she can get that.

382
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,120
And I doubt that she'd give up her Dutch nationality.

383
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Although, I don't know.

384
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
I'll have to ask her.

385
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
You know what?

386
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
We'll ask her together when I'm back.

387
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Man, I missed doing a show with a lady P.

388
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
And Adam?

389
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Yes.

390
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Stop touching yourself in an appropriate way when I'm talking to you.

391
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Respect.

392
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:21,120
In a world where evil walks the earth, where supervillains are taken over by demonic beings.

393
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,120
They all want one thing and one thing only.

394
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
To take over the world.

395
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,120
There's only one man who can stop them.

396
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,120
One man with the powers and abilities to kick some serious demon ass.

397
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,120
In a race against time to stop a portal that opens to hell itself.

398
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
One man.

399
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
One hero.

400
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,120
One son of a bitch you don't want to mess with.

401
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
He's faceless.

402
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,120
He's fearless.

403
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,120
He is black shadow.

404
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Those demons won't know what hit him.

405
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,120
From the mind of David Podio, book off their Steve Sailor.

406
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,120
Comes his story where the super powers beats the supernatural.

407
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Four men more.

408
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,120
At the Steve Sailor.net for more details.

409
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Like shadow.

410
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
Comes soon to pod shell.

411
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,120
And a pod catcher.

412
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,120
You know, if you haven't checked out one of these audio books.

413
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
You audio novel, I should say.

414
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
You really got to check it out, man.

415
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Because it's a great entertainment format.

416
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
It really is.

417
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,120
I've been listening to a couple on my international travels.

418
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,120
I stack them up because I don't have a regular daily commute.

419
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,120
So I stack them up and listen to a whole bunch of them.

420
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Another thing I've been actually even buying this off of iTunes.

421
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Recommendation from Head Sales, Weasel, Chris Jacob.

422
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Mad men.

423
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,120
I guess it aired at some point somewhere on television.

424
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
But it's on iTunes.

425
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,120
The entire series is about advertising men of the early 60s.

426
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,120
The guys from Madison Avenue and it's just phenomenal.

427
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,120
One of those episodic things.

428
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
It's just, that's very cool.

429
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,120
If you have not yet checked out pussy the musical.

430
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,120
Please hurry on over to pussythemusical.podshow.com from the.

431
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,120
Sad and perverted mind of Mark Yoshimo to Nemkoff.

432
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Yet again.

433
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Creating something that is an alter ego to a mainstream hit.

434
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Just when you thought you'd had enough of high school musical to come to pussy the musical.

435
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,120
I think he has 12 or maybe even 14 different songs in this musical performed.

436
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,120
By voices you probably know from the pod show network and beyond.

437
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
People creating independent media.

438
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,120
I have done a song called The Snatch.

439
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Myself is a boy band that will be in a upcoming episode of pussythemusical.

440
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:55,120
And I'd like to play you one from I think it's episode two or episode three.

441
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,120
I'm so happy that this came together.

442
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,120
You know my partner and co-founder of podshow Ron Bloom,

443
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,120
who I've been friends with for all going on 14 years now.

444
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,120
We've done business together.

445
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,120
It's more than just a partnership.

446
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:18,120
It's a brother ship and a way like a marriage.

447
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
No doubt about it.

448
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,120
We certainly see more of each other than our wives.

449
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,120
And you know, Ron's background is music.

450
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
You should Google him.

451
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
You see the stuff that he's done.

452
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
It's pretty extensive.

453
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,120
I kind of baked into what I do for podshow is this program.

454
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,120
I'm involved with a lot of production and just working with creative people,

455
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
which I really enjoy.

456
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,120
And it's not like my partner Ron enjoys it any less.

457
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,120
He just has different responsibilities.

458
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,120
For a company within our partnership and he doesn't get to do as much creative stuff

459
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
as I'd like him to do.

460
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
So I was delighted.

461
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Absolutely delighted when I heard his contribution to pussythemusical.

462
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,120
So I wanted a hot blue jeans and she said,

463
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,120
Come over here, boy.

464
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,120
And give me a dance.

465
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,120
So dance.

466
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
I want our letter.

467
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
We were back at my place.

468
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
She was doing the same dance.

469
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
And right on my face and I said,

470
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
hey, baby.

471
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Good thing I got no weekend plans.

472
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,120
Cause there's a road and I'm not.

473
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,120
And I ain't gonna put up with fire.

474
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,120
I got a girl on my left to go to my right.

475
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
I'm gonna be up all night.

476
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,120
And let us in the place where the money is sweeter.

477
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Swirl my life.

478
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,120
No, my swirls ain't better.

479
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,120
The other thing is going to be so, so tight.

480
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,120
I have to move around and not give me that good job.

481
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
That's right.

482
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
That's right.

483
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
That's right.

484
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
That's right.

485
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
That's right.

486
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
That's right.

487
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
That's right.

488
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
That's right.

489
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
That's right.

490
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
That's right.

491
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
That's right.

492
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
That's right.

493
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
That's right.

494
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
That's right.

495
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
That's right.

496
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
That's right.

497
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
That's right.

498
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
That's right.

499
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
That's right.

500
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
That's right.

501
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
That's right.

502
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
That's right.

503
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
That's right.

504
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
That's right.

505
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
That's right.

506
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
That's right.

507
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
That's right.

508
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
That's right.

509
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
That's right.

510
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
That's right.

511
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
That's right.

512
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
That's right.

513
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
That's right.

514
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
That's right.

515
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
That's right.

516
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
That's right.

517
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
That's right.

518
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
That's right.

519
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
That's right.

520
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
That's right.

521
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
That's right.

522
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
That's right.

523
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
That's right.

524
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
That's right.

525
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
That's right.

526
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
That's right.

527
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
That's right.

528
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
That's right.

529
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
That's right.

530
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
That's right.

531
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
That's right.

532
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
That's right.

533
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
That's right.

534
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
That's right.

535
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
That's right.

536
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
That's right.

537
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
That's right.

538
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
That's right.

539
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
That's right.

540
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
That's right.

541
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
That's right.

542
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
That's right.

543
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
That's right.

544
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
That's right.

545
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
That's right.

546
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
That's right.

547
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
That's right.

548
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
That's right.

549
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
That's right.

550
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
That's right.

551
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
That's right.

552
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
That's right.

553
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
That's right.

554
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
That's right.

555
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
That's right.

556
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
That's right.

557
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
That's right.

558
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
That's right.

559
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
That's right.

560
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
That's right.

561
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
That's right.

562
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
That's right.

563
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
That's right.

564
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
That's right.

565
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,120
That's right.

566
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,120
That's right.

567
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,120
And that's what I'm talking about.

568
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
But if I am.

569
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
Go to a room down.

570
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Hold down tonight.

571
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
Client.

572
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:08,120
Ron Bloom from Pussy the Musical, Music and lyrics by Mark Yosemore Nemkov, Vocal Slide Guitar by Ron Bloom.

573
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,120
Awesome.

574
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:16,120
Let me see, Colts coming in from across the seas, international listeners of the Daily Source Code.

575
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,120
It would love to hear more Presidential candidates on the show.

576
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
Yeah, you're not the only one.

577
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,120
That's better from Belgium.

578
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,120
One of your colors mentioned that it's a great platform.

579
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:36,120
I must concur because your platform's DSC must be, well, it's, I mean, I'm from Belgium.

580
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:43,120
I'm from Holland, but it's just, I've been following these primaries and the elections for years in the US.

581
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:52,120
And finally, this is a platform that, you know, it's script from all the over Chiever stuff that's going on.

582
00:25:52,120 --> 00:26:07,120
And it's just, it would be a such a great platform to get these guys on and get them to speak out to you just in a conversation instead of dog fighting each other in a debate or over achieving taking those positions.

583
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:15,120
And I totally concur with one of the commenters in the last show and get these people on.

584
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:29,120
It's a really a cry for, for also for the international DSC listeners to get to know the candidates in a different way in a way that is, well, more future bound.

585
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:36,120
I hope you get them on and, well, I'm, at this point, so, I'm almost blue again.

586
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:42,120
Scruncher and see this be, I love to meet you man, you're fucking asshole.

587
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,120
Great, love you, fuck you, bye.

588
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
I am, man.

589
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Well, you know, and it's, it's really true.

590
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:58,120
And I got to tell you, I eagerly look forward to new YouTube clips or a more new news articles about Dr. Ron.

591
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:07,120
And you just don't see anything, I think, that even comes close to the format that we used here on the daily source code.

592
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,120
Just ask the questions and let the guy answer.

593
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,120
I don't have to prove that I know something or nothing about politics doesn't make any difference what I do.

594
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,120
Ask the question, get the answer, wait until the guy's done talking.

595
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Everyone wants to be a fucking superhero in media.

596
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Well, I can be controversial.

597
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,120
And it's funny because I got a lot of people, blue pill takers, no doubt, who said, well, that was a pretty bland interview.

598
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Boy, that was pretty dull.

599
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,120
His message speaks for itself.

600
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:47,120
But we had now, 7,168, 475, 82 cents.

601
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Yeah, I wonder.

602
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,120
Of course, I'd take any any candidate who's running.

603
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
I would love to ask him all questions.

604
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,120
I'd love for this to be a platform so we can listen and learn.

605
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Is it possible, do you think?

606
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
I'm Gary Chris from Leviton, Pennsylvania.

607
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,120
I'm listening right now to DSC 680.

608
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,120
And I'm listening to a West Coast caller call about other politicians call him in.

609
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,120
And I'm going to give you a very simple answer if to why you won't get any of those politicians to call in.

610
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,120
I'm not saying the primary Republicans are Democrats.

611
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:26,120
And he's not, honestly, because if they actually answered the questions, honestly, we wouldn't like the answers.

612
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Because the answers would be, I'm rich.

613
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
I'm powerful.

614
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
I want to be more powerful.

615
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
I want to be more rich.

616
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,120
And I will flee from skinned your lives in order to get richer and more powerful.

617
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
And I have to.

618
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
That's what we don't want to hear.

619
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
And that's what they're not going to tell us.

620
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
And we're going to do.

621
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Fuck them all, I'm Gary.

622
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,120
Welcome back everyone towards me here.

623
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,120
We're here in our final round with Carmen and Crystal.

624
00:28:51,120 --> 00:29:01,120
In this last round, you shout out the first thing on your mind after I say a word, which is designed to bring you both to a common answer to our final question.

625
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
So here we go.

626
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Are you ready?

627
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Of course.

628
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Yes.

629
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
Great.

630
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
Okay then.

631
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Our first word is...

632
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Betrayal.

633
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
Murder.

634
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
I interesting.

635
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
The next word is...

636
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Conspiracy.

637
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
Hashen bracket.

638
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Okay then.

639
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
And our final word is...

640
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
Trust.

641
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Desire.

642
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Non-existent.

643
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
Now you have your three words.

644
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Using all of those along with your responses,

645
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,120
Tell me the name of the newest audio novel containing all of these attributes.

646
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
ASB.

647
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
He art of sex and bitchiness.

648
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,120
You are both correct.

649
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Michelle, please tell these low lives what they've won.

650
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,120
Both of you will receive and all expense paid subscription to the audio novel by Terry Woodard.

651
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,120
The art of sex and bitchiness.

652
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,120
This is an erotic murder mystery hosted exclusively on Potshow.

653

We suggest you retrieve your prize from the seclusion of your own home by going to ASB.potshow.com.

654
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Enjoy a little murder and betrayal, but you won't find them conditional love.

655
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Because we all know everything has a price.

656
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:24,120
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven,

657
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:32,120
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

658
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
Yeah.

659
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,120
I appreciate if you call in anything you got to say.

660
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Happy to hear about it.

661
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
It's nice to get a different topic started.

662
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Here's something that came in that caught my ear.

663
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Hi Adam.

664
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,120
This is Jennifer from Black Area, Scotland.

665
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
I'm an American living in Scotland.

666
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,120
And I'm an avid reader of the time magazine.

667
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,120
I said I'm an avid getter and I read it once a while.

668
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
This week, it caught my eye.

669
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
I'm a cover.

670
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
It says the secrets of the birth order.

671
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,120
And it talks about how the oldest children differ from the youngest.

672
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,120
And being the youngest of four, I was quite interested.

673
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
And it's got a very valid point.

674
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,120
How parents treat the children differently.

675
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,120
And I just thought it would be difficult for anybody who is a parent

676
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,120
who should maybe treat their children more equal.

677
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,120
Well, first of all, thank you so much for the tip.

678
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,120
And I will see if I can pick that up somewhere.

679
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,120
You know, this is funny.

680
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,120
I think everyone has this situation.

681
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
If you have multiple siblings.

682
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
I was the eldest of three.

683
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
I've two younger sisters.

684
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
Tiffany, two years younger than I am.

685
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,120
I think.

686
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Yeah, we're separated two years.

687
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Each of us.

688
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
I felt that I had to break all the ice.

689
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,120
You know, by the time we're all rolled around getting through

690
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,120
a puberty and adolescence.

691
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
It was fucking easy sailing.

692
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
Yeah, really easy sailing.

693
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,120
So I felt that I got a much harder treatment.

694
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,120
And you know, interesting.

695
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,120
I don't know if it parents should.

696
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,120
I think a lot of the treatment comes with experience.

697
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
You know, a lot of it is fear.

698
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
You got a kid, man.

699
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
It's like the most precious thing you have.

700
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
And you don't want to.

701
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,120
Look, why do you think I learned how to fly helicopter?

702
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,120
So I could hover above my daughter to figure out what the hell is going on

703
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
and where she's going.

704
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,120
This is, I find the point extremely valid.

705
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,120
And being the youngest of four.

706
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,120
I often feel like I'm the, the warmth of the litter and the one with

707
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,120
the, the least expectations put upon them.

708
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
Really?

709
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,120
And also my oldest brother is the golden child.

710
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
He is very good.

711
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
And he does not walk on water.

712
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,120
But my parents seem to think so.

713
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Oh, my parents.

714
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,120
I don't think they felt I walked on water anymore less than my sisters.

715
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
And my husband's quite similar.

716
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
He's the youngest of two.

717
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,120
And he sees the article as extremely relevant as well.

718
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
So it's just a little hit there.

719
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,120
And there's also a good interview with.

720
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,120
The Hollywood legends about lions and lambs.

721
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
It's Robert Redford Tom Cruise.

722
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,120
And you know, there's a couple of street.

723
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
And that's extremely good as well.

724
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
Okay.

725
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
Talk to you later.

726
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
Bye bye.

727
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
Yeah.

728
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
Thanks for calling.

729
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
You know, interesting.

730
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
You bring up kids.

731
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
You're forced.

732
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
We have only one child, Christina.

733
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Now 17 years old.

734
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,120
And so, you know, you can't treat her any better or worse than the next one.

735
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
Because we only got one.

736
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,120
I must say though, Sunday.

737
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,120
Had a really web 2.0 parenting moment.

738
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,120
And I don't want to get into too much detail.

739
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
But let's just put it this way.

740
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Christina was being a shit.

741
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,120
You know, as kids can get teenagers.

742
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:45,120
And I'm not want to overreact unnecessarily any more five years ago.

743
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,120
I was much more on edge.

744
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,120
But I've milled down significantly.

745
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,120
But she really, I mean, she was not being helpful to her mom.

746
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
Let's just put it that way.

747
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,120
It more ways than one.

748
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
Now I'm 5,000 miles away.

749
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,120
And separated by, you know, eight hours of time difference.

750
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,120
But it was, it was actually eight hours on Sunday.

751
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,120
And, you know, she just was a, in teenager mode.

752
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,120
But really, you know, I would have had to go and sit her down and talk to her in person.

753
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,120
And in fact, you know, I got her on the phone for like a couple seconds.

754
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,120
And, you know, I had this like Alec Baldwin moment almost.

755
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,120
I'm like, oh, this is not good.

756
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,120
And then she wouldn't talk to me and she wouldn't answer her phone.

757
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:34,120
And she, you know, but I had to, I had to have a, I had to communicate with her.

758
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,120
You know, it's, I couldn't just let it go.

759
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,120
Because it is something I had to be discussed immediately.

760
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:46,120
And I had to sit down and, you know, and be a dad, you know, sometimes it's not fun.

761
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,120
And I could not get through to her through any means.

762
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,120
And then I did something very interesting.

763
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,120
She has a Facebook account. I have a Facebook account.

764
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,120
Some of you may have seen this since been deleted.

765
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,120
But I went over to her Facebook wall.

766
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
And I wrote on it.

767
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,120
And I said, you know, hey, man, you really got a line.

768
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,120
And then she wrote back on my wall.

769
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,120
And then you have to hit wall to wall to compare, I guess.

770
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,120
And, you know, she had big attitude.

771
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,120
And I came back and, you know,

772
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,120
you know, continued with the writing saying, look, you know,

773
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,120
I think your life ain't so bad.

774
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,120
You might want to ask some of your friends here who many of whom have been over to the house.

775
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:34,120
Many who seem to be sometimes nicer than you around us.

776
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,120
And then she went off in the writing, and this is all happening on Facebook.

777
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,120
She went off and like, you know, when, what are you doing on Facebook anyway?

778
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,120
You're too old, you know, one of those.

779
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,120
And so I said, look, I'm frustrated.

780
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:53,120
And I have no other way to, you know, it's my last desperate way of communicating with you.

781
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,120
And a couple hours later, sure enough.

782
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:06,120
And I hope I really do hope that some of her friends on the Facebook said, hey, dude, you're out of line.

783
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,120
Which she was, as she knows it.

784
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,120
And she was a Brett Full and she was sorry.

785
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,120
And, you know, we broke through the barrier.

786
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,120
But it all happened on Facebook.

787
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,120
I just want that to be very, very bizarre.

788
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,120
An extremely bizarre parenting web 2.0 moments.

789
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
Hey, hey, there's something.

790
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
I think I hear a jingle coming.

791
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Another web 2.0 parenting moment.

792
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,120
Alright, let's bang out some pod saying music show.

793
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,120
Big bang radio.

794
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:55,120
I just want to close my eyes to the world.

795
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:02,120
I need to spend the night with you, girl.

796
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,120
Just give me a reason for some day.

797
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,120
Release the sensation when you play.

798
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:15,120
Make a link, a link, a link, a go all the way.

799
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,120
Hear it on the radio.

800
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
What more say?

801
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
Let's see.

802
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,120
I want to hear what's up real wide.

803
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,120
Can't miss something say, trip from my mind.

804
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,120
To hear me in the meantime.

805
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:43,120
I just want to spend the night back in time.

806
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:50,120
And bring the sounds to life from my mind.

807
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,120
That's a dream you're reason for today.

808
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,120
Play it up and drive away.

809
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:03,120
Let it go, let it go, let it go, go all the way.

810
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,120
Hear it on the radio.

811
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,120
What more say?

812
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,120
Let's see.

813
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,120
I want to hear what's up real wide.

Can't miss something say, trip from my mind.

856
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,120
star cast.

857
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,620
You can exchange gifts.

858
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,820
You can exchange to socks.

859
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,420
You can exchange fruit cake.

860
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,520
But you cannot exchange family.

861
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,620
So make sure you check out this Christmas when it hits theaters November 21st, 2007.

862
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,620
And I'm out.
