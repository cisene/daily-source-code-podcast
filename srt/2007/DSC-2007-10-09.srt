00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You better be careful out there on next couple of weeks you hear me?

Let's close the room.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Two sides.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Two brothers collide.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In a world where TV networks, movies, studios,

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and record labels still think they can govern what you see in here.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and make big media corporations wet their tiny,

but the trains were all messed up there was some some anomaly on the rails

318
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,760
not quite sure what exactly has happened I've been looking at the BBC news

319
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,760
website seem to find out and things so far so well I kind of wait to see if

320
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,560
it clears up and if I'll go in and all I was like perfect I can do I can do

321
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,840
a source code because this morning I really took some time to catch up on email

322
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
of course I got back yesterday afternoon from the portable media expo

323
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,440
I left the swanky shareton was around 233 o'clock drove down or where drove east

324
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,640
down whatever drove over to Los Angeles to LAX and hopped aboard the trusty red and

325
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,040
white virgin Atlantic and it was good good flight now a lot of turbulence

326
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,360
actually the first two three hours of the flight but I kind of like that you

327
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,120
know it kind of makes reminds me that we're actually flying and that it

328
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,480
happens to the big planes too that's kind of nice and it was good and you just

329
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,440
to kind of decompress and chill a little bit because I had meetings right up

330
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,800
until I left and you know there's so many people that I didn't get to see

331
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,200
this year which is unfortunate but of course I only had you know like a

332
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,480
really a full day and then or no yeah like a full day and then half a day and

333
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,040
a lot of people didn't show up until Saturday so that made it tough pdf was

334
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,440
there pdlb fenton didn't get to see him I also heard that the the buzzout

335
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,080
load buzzout loud seen it's a podcast of undetermined length I listened to

336
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,080
that almost every single day I really would have wanted to meet those guys so

337
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,360
they weren't there but it was good I have to say in all pretty good show not

338
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,160
necessarily you know for the expo itself you know I did check out the

339
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,840
award show and and one of those parties and it was the the room was just

340
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,240
way too big for what was going on you know that was just a theatrical mistake

341
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,000
if anything so not that big a deal and of course next year the show is super

342
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,760

348
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,320
nothing too spectacular so you know a little bit groggy to say the least a little

349
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,360
bit jet lag of course it was only a four day trip out to Chicago then

350
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,280

356
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:58,000
the ceiling height that I need their idea of a of shower space can differ

357
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,360
sometimes from that of a Yankee doodle dandy so now I'm taking the shower and

358
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,160
literally I'm so tired I'm leaning against the wall with my with my forehead

359
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,040
kind of like so it's kind of like in the corner between the wall and the glass

360
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,000
the showers there my cheek is pressed up against the press up against the

361
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,880
glass door and just chill on you know the water just running all over me and

362
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,600
I'm you know kind of you know vibe there and I I was probably under that nice

363
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,600
warm shower of love for 15 minutes maybe 20 just you know completely in my

364
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,640
element completely coming coming down from the trip cleansing my my outer and

365
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:47,280
and inner self and all of a sudden I hear Patricia like screaming and she's

366
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,120
running up the stairs and he's like what's wrong what's wrong and she's she's

367
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,400
like completely freaked out and she's thinking you know it's like there's

368
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,600
something wrong and I'm like and now so I'm pressed up with my cheek against

369
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:04,880
the against the glass and well here's what happened unbeknownst to me you know

370
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,120
Christina sometimes uses our shower and she had left all kinds of crap

371
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,000
all kinds of products and the lid of something I don't know what the hell

372
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,640
it was but it was a really maybe it's like a thing that's inside a lid of a

373
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:25,520
jar of some chemical compound had slipped on to the drain of you know of the

374
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:31,640
shower and so the water had come up and it started to overflow through the

375
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,560
through the door you know there's lots of lots of once it gets high enough

376
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,400
it can basically seep out now it's not that high to begin with so I you know

377
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,160
I don't have my glasses on and I'm vibing against the wall there so I didn't

378
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:52,920
notice it but water was literally streaming down into the living room into the

379
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,040
the the the den that we have downstairs which isn't really a den yet but it

380
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,040
still has boxes and all kinds of stuff from the move and the water is just

381
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,080
streaming down and there's water everywhere and Patricia is convinced as she

382
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,280
walks in she's convinced that I've passed out or you know something is gone

383
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,000
incredibly wrong and I you know and I'm just shoved up against the wall there and

384
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,720
she thinks I've had a heart attack or whatever and the water you know it's a

385
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,480
tip but it's a perfect scenario right you're sitting downstairs and also in

386
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,000
the water just starts streaming down you walk upstairs and there's your

387
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
husband's cheek pressed against the glass you just convinced that was a

388
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,560
garner so that was so that was like a freak out you know and I'm like

389
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,080
what was it going on and it was it was a mess it was like Niagara Falls coming

390
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,800
down that was really really bad now there was a silver lining to all of this

391
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,080
because in the in that den room there were a couple of boxes on the floor and

392
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,560
because the floor was just completely wet they were getting wet so and one of

393
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,360
them was marked books I'm like okay I got to take these books out so and these

394
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,040
are you know some of my my favorite picture books you know coffee table books

395
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,200
and underneath it is a jewelry box and Patricia for a while now she's been

396
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,080
telling Christina and I that she's convinced that there's a box of jewelry of

397
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,040
hers that was stolen somewhere in the move and of course that was the jewelry box

398
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,960
so I was really lucky because that really turned Patricia's move around

399
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,600
I imagine now she's been in the shit for almost two weeks one of which I was

400
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,480
gone even more than that actually with the the kitchen floor being redone

401
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,200
and all kinds of stuff happening and all kinds of dust and a big mess and I

402
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,480
was you know finally perfect and I came home and the candles were lit and

403
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,920
everything smelled nice and the whole house was nice and there I go and and

404
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:50,200
ruin a good vibe so needless to say no sex yet comic strip comic strip

405
00:14:50,200 --> 00:15:01,720

not American free trade agreement to European Union is a total bush complete

414
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,880
idiocy existence of European Union is a garanter of peace amongst its

415
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:20,120
members and americans should shut the fuck about it oh man okay yo yo yeah

416
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,800
who's high now yeah I didn't say the North American free trade agreement I

417
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,040
said the concept of the North American Union that's something completely

418
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,200
different of which of course NAFTA would ultimately play a part I'm not

419
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,040
I don't want to talk about that stuff on today's show the word enough comments

420
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,920
about it anyway kind of shot that word over the weekend or Friday I should

421
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:50,840
say let me think oh yeah this is excellent so of course you know I've been

422
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:58,000
on my rampage about the TSA division of the homeland security department the

423
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,360
transportation security agency or is it administration I think it's agency

424
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,080
and you know a lot of people sending me links and stuff and there's lots of

425
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,720
comparable stories and all kinds of nightmares obviously that go on and

426
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,560
I'm sure that was going on with airport security even before 9-11 but the

427
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,400
fact that you can't you know yell and bitch about it now without going to jail

428
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,960
kind of makes it like no fun you know and from the pod safe music network

429
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,960

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:42,120
I streaked through town to some policeman shouted halt and I believe he mentioned

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:49,000
something about a sexual assault and then he cuffed me but you realize it's really not

451

459
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:03,120
fantastic I believe under the the parody clause that's allowed on the podship music network

460
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:10,000
but you can get sued for anything I guess cancha so it is a big big week for us here at the

461
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,240
London offices BT pod show where starting today actually it started this morning we're covering

462
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:23,680
the 2007 digital music awards we're doing that in conjunction with a launch of the plus the plus

463
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:33,040
tv dot com which is you know this is really a brainchild there you go I wrote up a document actually

464
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,120
I posted this on curry dot com I wrote up a dot you know maybe I want to just read to you what

465
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,320
I wrote a bit easier here you go I in September 2006 I wrote an internal poncho document there's a

466
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,440
link so you can actually read that a described streaming video station my underlying thought was a

467
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,800
vision of what MTV might be today had they chosen to stay on their core path of short form video

468
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,400
which today would include top youtube hits podcast episodic series and a healthy dose of talent

469
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,520
with an attitude we made a few different choices in our technical implementation but otherwise

470
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,920
came pretty close to the original concept over the past six weeks we've been testing the system

471
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,120
slowly scaling everything up in preparation for her prime time launch 72 hours of coverage of the

472
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,880
2007 digital music awards this week oh yeah now gone of course big props to Lisa Aaron's who is

473
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,360
pretty much single handedly implemented the plan borrowing resources from anywhere she could

474
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,480
stealing where she had to my personal thanks to everyone from the San Francisco HQ BT pod show in

475
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,560
Vincent's crew who have put in months of long hours of work to bring this project to fruition

476
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,120
what else do I say here our backstage past coverage of the DMAs has already started and

477
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,760
includes some familiar faces from our network and the fun is just beginning oh well from today

478
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,800
onwards you can discover great shows music and videos on the plus 24 seven live no jive

479
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,400
so yeah that's and it's interesting because we sent out a press release I think earlier

480
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,760
last week and there was quite a vibe about it people at the expo talking about it and everyone

481
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,640
seemed kind of excited and you know I've been watching it since early this morning and it really

482
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,840
you know actually let me see what's playing right now because you know now we've added

483
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:21,280
basically VJ segments we've got to OJ Jill Mills, Dr. Cockney I know Natalie Delcante is in the

484
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,080
London office right now doing some segments we're going to do it all throughout the

485
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,400
digital musical awards we've got our own private party area right near the red carpet

486
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,600
actually I've pressed play now come in isn't starting with the hell is this okay here it goes buffering

487
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,920
and you know and it's just basically going to keep going okay what's playing right now so we got

488
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:53,520
we got the format is really what's most interesting to me is we're setting up an automatic format

489
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,440
we just fill in all the stuff that that runs through podshow dot com it's a great way to

490
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,840
get exposure and if you look at the the plus tv dot com home page you'll see that it's really easy to

491
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,400
click into that particular piece of video whether it's a single clip video or whether it's a music

492
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,400
video or if it's an episode from a show you can click through it you can get archives and of course

493
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,480
you can subscribe to it so it's kind of cool I don't know what is this that's playing it's like

494
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,880
two bunny rabbits beating the shit out of each other cool it's a very angry music videos on this

495
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,480
thing I like it a lot though I'm just going to keep talking for a second see if we hit a VJ segment or not

496
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,240
cry probably not anyway so we'll be covering the digital musical awards you can check it out

497
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,400
live we have hope well it's the same video stream that you find at the plus tv dot com you know we

498
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:58,080
got to see if it's a second or a promo this is brand in the podshow intern super music video show

499
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,800
so and it's a great way for me to catch up on stuff because we produce so much and we have so many

500
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,840
different producers on the network that it's almost impossible you know to be looking at stuff

501
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,080
so now if I just keep the stream running in the background eventually I'll see something that I like

502
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,200
or I'll see something that I know I should be looking at that very cool very very excited go team good job

503
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:42,960
Jesus we've got part two of our star wars the force unleashed feature and you can win

504
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,320
copies of juice too for the Xbox 360 that's all on games rezoal tippy found at gamesrezoal dot

505
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:55,120
beatypotshow dot com excellent math thank you yeah so just one more thing about uh about the plus tv

506
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,800
you know I this so if you look at it what I'm hoping you'll see is that you know this is indeed

507
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,640
the path that MTV could have taken and then maybe they couldn't have even have taken it because

508
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,840
there was a really weird gap where music videos were ubiquitous and you know it would have been

509
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,960
very very hard for them to do the same type of business and increased ratings in less they took

510
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,680
the path I did which was you know more long form and of course eventually long form reality stuff

511
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,440
but I think that this this has kind of that that MTV vibe to it and you know the the way the

512
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,000
videos look are just as important as as the music so you know a lot of thought is going into it

513
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,560
and uh and a very small people are working very very hard to make it work um yeah I'm pretty happy

514
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,720
with it oh anyway uh so there's uh there's been a couple of uh mainstream mockery and fake

515
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,760
re-spottings and sightings and stories uh on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean let me start with the

516
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,080
US first Gary Alexander uh it's gonna tell us how reality programming is made hey Adam Gary Alexander

517
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,640
from the ultimate podcast what's going on um listen I wanted to comment on and I don't know why

518
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,640
I haven't done this before on um you know uh setting up reality shows and things of that nature

519
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:18,720
uh how the media are the TV networks are kind of pulled a little over I I was involved I was a

520
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,560
cast member on a show on A&E called um called Mary Dim Vegas where I performed weddings for this

521
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,680
wedding chapel here called uh people I think it's wedding chapel as Elvis and we need to hold

522
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:39,760
whatever motion and um many different other um characters as well and we were the show was uh on A&E

523
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,120
and they filmed a couple things and the first day of filming for some reason I was late

524
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,920
well after about a month of editing they came back to film a couple things that they needed to

525
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,200
like pick up shots well the pick up shots happens to be all of the storyline revolve around

526
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,560
me being late for the first five minutes of the show so they actually had a camera crew get in the

527
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:09,600
car with me and I just drove down the street and I did like I was on my cell phone calling into work

528
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,320
and during editing it looked like some guy with a camera was you know left my home with me and

529
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,680
traveled with me that entire day and it never happened never happened like that and obviously

530
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:27,200
that's reality television not the news or anything like that but it's very obvious to see what

531
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,800
goes down on the on the shows and uh I was part of of reality television on A&E part of the

532

540
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,160
five seven meanwhile back in Blighty more trickery and mockery of foot with the mainstream

541
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,800
I don't it's uh Mike here from Bristol, Elis and Go-Mem we've read this one recently

542
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,640
it's really said yesterday came out the BBC's being caught with its pants down again this time

543
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,880
on a children's television program called Blue Peter which is one of the longest running television

544
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,200
programs in the world they received children over a rig term telephone vote named over the naming

545
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:14,160
give up of a cat one of the pet's little pets on that program and it was over the naming

546
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:20,240
and the kids chose one name and the editor or whoever it was chose another name and the

547
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,160
yeah BBC and they've been caught with their pants down on it so you don't find that actually on

548
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,720
the BBC's websites and apparently they've got to find by off-com fifty thousand pounds over

549
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,400
which is probably not allowed many for BBC although that is public statement anyway

550
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,200
which comes from our license money for the year while you pay 150 years in effort television

551
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:45,280
is an UK think it is and I don't know I'm got to leave but I just a little point I think the actual

552
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,560
name for the cat was socks but they've been receiving all the children and their program was designed

553
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:56,080
for uh my laptop at 15 year old 16 year olds and it was a telephone vote we've created them

554
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,480
telephone numbers as well so they must make a lot of money off of that that's a little red pill

555
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:08,160
blue bell for me yeah man screw those guys we've got our own tricks to play look here's Jill Mills

556
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,200
this is so funny Jill Mills is going through all the all the nominees and with her Jill Mills

557
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:22,400
attitude it's very very funny I love this it's like a real station hold on we turn out

558
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:31,520
is that the real deal he makes me piss myself of it's a nice Jill fantastic okay let me see yeah there

559
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,400

560
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:44,160
podcast music network yeah his name is Waldruiro he's from Jersey of course check this out

Madlib the unicorns black Sabbath the John Williams Kojo condo video game music so apparently

563
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:10,000
this guy is completely nuts about video game scores and and he does all kinds of really interesting

564
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,200
classical stuff and I presume it's all synthesized although it sounds really really good and

565
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,320
I have to say it almost sounds like the real deal final bit here in his in his bio on the PMN

566
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,080
I'm also here I'm heavily influenced by video games films et cetera final fantasy games
