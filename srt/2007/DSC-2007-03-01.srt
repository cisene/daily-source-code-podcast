00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I present Padshal's poet laureate Melvin P. LeBeth.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Roses are ready. My sweater is beige. For your domain name needs, you should go to this page. GoDaddy.com.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now, there are those among you who have wronged. There are those among you who have sinned.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But remember, the mark of the beast is 666, and the mark of the curry is 555. Now set forth congregation and bum rush the chart.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
60 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is D.A.C.55, a podcast of Adam Carey, who is not scared of nuclear rockets from Iran.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Because he is equipped with internet domain from GoDaddy and a cup of soldiers coffee.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Fuck you.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
A poet says, just be yourself, always be true, say to some free.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You got to love me.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So we first met always give you real.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
In a moment we'll never give you real.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I live alone. Give it up.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because it's no one.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I live alone.

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I live alone.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I live alone.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I live alone.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I live alone.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I live alone.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I live alone.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I live alone.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I live alone.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I live alone.

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I live alone.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I live alone.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I live alone.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I live alone.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I live alone.

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I live alone.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I live alone.

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I live alone.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I live alone.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I live alone.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I live alone.

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I live alone.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I live alone.

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I live alone.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I live alone.

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I live alone.

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I live alone.

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I live alone.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,400
But courtesy of a TV log who suggested it to me lifted culture, we rock, damn, do we rock.

46
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:14,400
And also, thank you, comic strip blogger, you're intro to today's triple five or treble

47
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,640
five, as we would say, and United Kingdom, treble five Charlie, that was perfect, man.

48
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,040
It fit exactly right.

49
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,120
And it is daily source code, Delta Sierra Charlie, five, five, five, everybody, how

50
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,440
you're doing, coming to you from the Kori condo in Northern California.

51
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,080
It's, of course, just turned Thursday, it's 12, 20 a.m.

52
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,680
So kind of Wednesday night, I'm so tired, you cannot imagine tomorrow, I fly home, so

53
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,800
I arrive Friday, like mid morning, I'm really hoping, and I'm just trying to keep

54
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,600
in the vibe, through better living through chemistry, actually, using some caffeine and

55
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,680
other things to stay awake, and then, you know, I'm able to put myself to sleep very quickly.

56
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,120
So I'm hoping I'll be able to sleep on the entire flight home, I'm really looking forward

57
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
to it.

58
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,640
But it's been a, it's been a great stay, and I didn't have a, well, it was actually

59
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,160
today was a very good day, because everyone's kind of tired near the end of the week,

60
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,760
a little bit punchy, me in particular, yeah, then shit that's irritating you, or you're

61
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,120
thinking about, you get into conversations, he did debates, and I love that stuff.

62
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,120
That's a big part of the creative process of company building to me.

63
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
I had a great time.

64
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,800
A highlight of the day, I appeared on cranky geeks with John C. Dvorak.

65
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,560
Now, cranky geeks dot com is where you can find this show.

66
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,200
It's a very entertaining program.

67
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,480
I've been a fan of John Dvorak's for many years.

68
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,240
We worked together on an original pilot for Cnet back in the day when it was purely meant

69
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
for television.

70
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,280
Actually, it was going to be an interactive television channel.

71
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,160
That's a story for a whole another day.

72
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,640
I've been looking forward to seeing him again.

73
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,280
He was quite gracious as a host.

74
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:06,320
He invited me to go out to lunch after the show, and I made a really, really stupid

75
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
mistake.

76
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,720
Like a real rookie mistake, I was severely injured due to my loss of porn today, and let

77
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,000
me explain to you.

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,880
I've been waiting for the, what do they call it?

79
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,440
The navigation kit for the Nokia and 800 Internet tablet.

80
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,720
Now this is not even for sale in the stage yet.

81
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,080
And, you know, this is, in fact, the holder that comes with the kit, I believe, is a prototype

82
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
holder.

83
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,840
And I've been waiting for this thing because it got stuck at customs, and, you know, then

84
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,480
I got the developer device, we're going to have to give her a name, by the way.

85
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,800
The N800 who's going to spread her ports wide open for developers to come in and violate

86
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,400
her file system, let's think of a name for the N800 that would be pretty cool.

87
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,320
So, you know, I want the nav kit on there as well, otherwise it makes no sense what are

88
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,400
the developers working on if they can't develop with the real, the real deal, right?

89
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,240
All the stuff that's in there and functioning.

90
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,120
And so I get a box and I like, it's a box from Finland, you know, and this is before I

91
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
go to cranky geek.

92
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,440
So it's like quarter, twelve, and to be there, twelve, ten, it's just five blocks away,

93
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,360
so not that bad by car.

94
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,440
Drove Trinity, by the way, Rosie drove me, showfird me, uh, in Trinity up to, uh, up to the

95
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,680
swankies, if Davis offices, now it's pretty cool, and I'll arrive in style.

96
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,480
So I grabbed the box and like, at least I give me some of those box with, because, of course,

97
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,120
you know, the fins, man, they seem to have blow towards to open up this packaging, and

98
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,720
that's to postal packaging.

99
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,320
She gives me one of these brand new, um, titanium scissors, which I only know this because,

100
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,640
um, I found out exactly how effective they are.

101
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,320
I sliced open my, uh, my middle finger on my left hand.

102
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,240
I mean, like, really, like, and it, I could feel the blade just gliding through the flash

103
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,680
because it was such a brand new pair of scissors, and I want, uh, uh, and, you know,

104
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:04,040
blood is just like spouting out, literally, and luckily Carolina, who, uh, sits a reception

105
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,000
for us, doesn't mean she's actually a receptionist, uh, she immediately, you know, she's like,

106
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,520
oh, I love blood. Come on. Let me help you. I got plenty of it for you, baby.

107
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,680
Uh, so, uh, so the good news is it wasn't indeed the world kit that came in. It's

108
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,480
very happy about that. Um, the blood is, uh, the box is now somewhat blood stained, uh, and I

109
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,360
have a huge bandaid on my middle finger, which I'm happy to show anybody except that kind of

110
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,360
breaks them out when I stick it up, the middle finger that is. Um, yeah, I'll start with that

111
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,920
and cranky geeks, and, uh, well, so we do, uh, I had dinner with Ron and, uh, his lovely wife,

112
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,560
Marta, and I was nice for something done that in a couple of trips. So, uh, life is good.

113
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,640
It certainly is. Got some, uh, I think some more good news. I actually, I have an abundance of

114
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,040
stuff that I need to get to. There's so many different promos and things that I want to play

115
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,800
this stuff left over from yesterday show. Um, but of course, it being Thursday. Well, you know,

116
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,920
we, we shovel up all the food, the, all the food bar onto Fridays. So when it comes to Thursdays,

117
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,520
it's gotta be my girlfriend, the one who keeps my ass in shape nice and tight for the 42 years that I

118
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,080
am, her name is Amy Mack. It's time to ask her size, everybody. Hey, Amy. Hey, Adam,

119
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,360
Amy Mack. Hey, baby. Oh, I missed you so much, Amy. I missed you. Well, since you can best

120
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,120
to a fatness attack the other day, I'm going to play it for you. Oh, we're going to work it off

121
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,080
today. Uh, Mr. Amy, are you going to make me work it on down on the floor, so adjust whatever

122
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,680
you need to. Hey, hold on on the floor, like this, Mr. Amy. Good. These are called mountain climbers,

123
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,400
and you've probably done them before. Hmm. I've done lots of things before. Get in a push-up position.

124
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,000
So hands are your shoulders and you're up on your tiptoes. Oh, okay. Like this.

125
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,040
Now you're going to place your left foot up for your chest while keeping your hands in the same place.

126
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,800
Oh, please. This puts you in a deep launch. Yeah. And then switch those legs. Okay. Yeah.

127
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,720
I'm good at this. It's my fancy experience. Quickly. Yeah. Oh, yeah, run. The goal is to move fast and do as many

128
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:04,920
steps as you can. Ready? Oh, I'm going to do one of them. Okay. Oh, yes. I can do it.

129
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,520
Do you do a certain number of them? You're going to do as many in 30 seconds as possible?

130
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,080
I'm going. I'm going. Oh, hey, me. Keep breathing. Thank you for reminding me.

131
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,160
10 seconds down. 20 to go. Okay. I'm going, baby. I'm going as fast as I can. Do those

132
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,520
areas melt away. Oh, yes. It's melting. It's melting. Amy's melting. All right. 10 seconds. Oh.

133
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,920
Really keep those legs under you. Oh, Amy. It's happening to me. Great job. Now we

134
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,160
need to get that button top shape for the answer to my video. I mean, I'm thinking people will get tired

135
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,920
of staring at my butt. So we'll bring you in for I can. You better go find your speedo. We got to get this

136
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:48,120
thing go. Amy, I love you. Next time. Bye, bye, baby. Oh, I love you. I love you. You know I do. Are you

137
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,840
kidding me? You will, I mean, since we're talking about it, Amy's ass is amazing. It's triple A. It's

138
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:02,120
just like that. It's a triumphant. When is that exercise video show coming out anyway? Come on.

139
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,520
Let's get out of it already. Chris Mack. It's a working boy.

140
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,080
Okay. Hey, you know, James called in from London. And we've been talking about

141
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,400
network names and what kind of what is your network name and and open and unlocked. I'm talking

142
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:25,000
about wireless networks. Why if I open and and locked up networks and, you know, just the abundance

143
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,600
of wireless in our world. And you know, how I like to keep my network completely open so that anyone

144
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,600
can, you know, use it if they need to because hey, you know, so if I need a network, I'll use someone

145
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,800
else's. Of course, I can't find any more open networks here. And I'm on the 24th floor of the

146
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:50,280
condo and everything's locked up and closed up and James calls in. James regular color of the show.

147
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:57,640
And he, he, I think he has just a wonderful idea, a really, really wonderful idea that I believe

148
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:05,960
could become a culture, culture in the world of sharing your sharing your pipes,

149
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,800
your tubes, tying your tubes with your buddies. Listen to this.

150
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:58,360
Yeah, James sorted. Yeah, I think it's a beautiful idea. It's very simplistic. You know, there's a lot of

151
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,560
open source firmware and stuff that you can load onto your wireless access points,

152
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:13,080
Belkin and others and what what dealing and all that stuff. And, and lots of cool stuff,

153
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,040
actually, a whole systems where you can leave your access point open and then when someone connects

154
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,680
to it, you'll first get to come to a webpage. Very much like team mobile does it or a hotel

155
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:31,400
wireless system. And then from there, you can request access. But that requires real work and

156
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:37,480
crazy as work. You know, then I just, you know, it's geeks who are going to do that stuff. But the idea

157
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,040
of changing your network name to your email address is eloquent and simple and very nice. And I

158
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,520
think if I saw a wireless access point that had someone's email address in it, I believe I'd

159
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,160
probably email them and say, hey, dude, can I use your your access point once in a while? I really

160
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,240
think I would. It's a it's a simple yet very nice idea. Thank you James,

161
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,000
much appreciate. Adam, Alan, Britain, Basel here, long time listener. I was listening to the

162
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,240
five, five, two, Charlie today and a couple of things occurred to me. First of all, the piece of

163
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,920
music that was kind of classical. I think that was when you were having some interesting girls with

164
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:19,560
cellos. I was talking about another track from Adam's first gen iPod. Yeah, man, I love chicks

165
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:27,080
who play cellos, chicks and cellos. It's it's it's Alt it's porn. A lot of things are porn.

166
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,520
Opening that Nokia box was what that's what the porn that I was referring to. These are nice

167
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:36,200
when you open up a box with new gear inside. I have to say Apple boxes smell the nicest.

168
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,880
It really do. Anyway, back to the other porn. I remember correctly from a long, long time ago.

169
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,240
Anyway, moving on this whole thing with your first gen iPod made me wonder, I remember when you

170
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,440
went to pot-safe music and you were, well, terrified, it's probably stretching a little bit,

171
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,800
but you were pretty worried about the authorities coming and so in you for all that don't

172
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,280
license music you were playing. I just wondered what's changed. Why have you suddenly decided that

173
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,800
it's okay and that fear should now go away. I just wonder whether there's something happening in the

174
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:16,200
background who knows. If you're going to bring back some non-pot-safe music, I think you should

175
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,720
bring back young palettes head-test. That was one of the big parts of the DSC that I think a lot of

176
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,880
people would miss. Anyway, one other subject, you were talking about the guys comments about the

177
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,960
Trinity thing and the green connotations. Well, I kind of agree with some of what he's saying.

178
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:41,560
Your take phrase goes, save the world, win valuable prizes, saving the world could be

179
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:48,040
construed as being green. Anyway, there you go. Just my inputs, keep up the work of the DSC.

180
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,640
It's great listen to every morning on the way into work and of course folder.

181
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,400
Holder, of course. Hi, man, thanks. So that's, I played that because basically we've answered all

182
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,920
those questions or the topics that have been pretty much discussed. So if you're new to this show,

183
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,640
and you didn't know what that was about, you know anything, but they're all resolved. Okay,

184
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,120
it's all taken care of. Speaking of hot chicks with cellos, or stand-up bases, as it were.

185
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:22,520
Remember these girls? Busiveous bitties. This is Amanda Monaco,

186
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,840
guitarist for the Lasivia's Bitties and Bittie cast. In January 2005, I was diagnosed with multiple

187
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,320
sclerosis, an unpredictable inflammatory disease of the central nervous system.

188
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:41,160
Please join the Lasivia's Bitties and our team, Team Bittie. On Sunday, April 22nd, 2007

189
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,440
at New York City, South Street, Seaport for the MS Walk, New York City, 2007.

190
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,760
Go to bittiesmusic.com to join our team for the walk, or make a donation through Team Bittie.

191
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,600
Last year, we raised over $23,000 for MS research, and this year, our goal is $50,000.

192
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,360
Any donation, smaller large, is a big help in our fight. Last year, there were many small donations

193
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,920
from great people like you, and those small donations add up and they make a huge difference.

194
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,080
Thankfully, I've been doing well and living my life as I always have, but not everyone is as lucky as I am.

195
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,080
MS continues to strike people in the prime of their lives, and its effects can be devastating.

196
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,760
Visit bittiesmusic.com to walk with us, or to make a donation to help stop this disease and

197
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,240
find a cure. Thanks. See you at the walk.

198
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,160
Oh yeah, I love those girls.

199
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,920
Hey, is it wrong that if I told you that I've had sexual dreams about Amanda Monaco?

200
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:03,480
Actually, I think I've had fantasies about all of the bitties. Go to the side. You just see what I mean.

201
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,840
I presume CC's walk at a long this year. It's fantastic. I get 20 more than $23,000.

202
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,960
And what kills me is I was just listening to that promo.

203
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,760
MS has been in my lifetime, has been there throughout my entire lifetime.

204
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,320
You know, we've solved a lot of things. We've had all diseases come and go.

205
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,080
And we haven't figured this one out. We really should do this. This makes absolutely no sense.

206
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,800
So please participate, contribute, as you can. It would be much appreciated.

207
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,320
And I'm sure Amanda Monaco will let you two have fantasies about her.

208
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:55,320
Oh, yes, of course. I got feedback from our superstar actor here in San Francisco.

209
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:04,040
As I was so excited about Eric Bergen's performance in Jersey Boys here in San Francisco.

210
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:10,280
And he sent in a lengthy comment, but it's as always entertaining funny and informative. So let's

211
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,280
listen to what he has to say. Hey, Adam, it's Eric Bergen from the cast of Jersey Boys.

212
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,720
First off, thank you for Wednesday's show. It was so fantastic to hear you talk about the show

213
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:28,920
and such a positive way. I'm so, so glad you enjoyed it. I knew you would, but I was a little

214
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,680
worried when Tuesday night we didn't exactly get the response out of the audience because it was a

215
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,200
little bit older of an audience that we normally do. Usually it's like a rock concert at this show.

216
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,280
People just screaming and it was a little bit more reserved Tuesday night. So I am really glad

217
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,840
you enjoyed it and that you totally got the show and you absolutely understood it and that you identified

218
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,240
with it. It meant a lot to me and the cast was very excited to hear that you were in the audience.

219
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,560
I had to say in a personal note, this whole no one second. As you know, I didn't go back stage.

220
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,960
When it was hot chicks were they excited about me being there as well. I do think a follow-up

221
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,440
is warranted in this case, because that was a good look in girls in the, in the cast.

222
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,480
Whole thing has come full circle. It's absolutely hilarious. You know, back in 04, when I first

223
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,160
got into podcasting, I, you know, you would a first show I listened to. And it was really the

224
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:29,720
reason why I got into podcasting. And now two years later, you're doing almost a whole show about

225
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:37,480
me in Jersey Boys. It's absolutely unreal. So first of all, thank you so much for coming and

226
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,520
and really glad you enjoyed the show. The second thing is, I just wanted to make some

227
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,480
some clarifications to some of the things that you were saying about the show. You are absolutely

228
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,680
correct. There is a broader production and there is a San Francisco production. Both the exact

229
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:58,440
same show, two different casts. There is not currently a Vegas production like you had said,

230
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,320
but it is in the works. It should be happening soon. There should be details of coming out about

231
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:10,520
the Vegas production sometime in the coming months. The schedule for, for my cast is this,

232
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,400
we're playing San Francisco, the current theater until the middle of May. I'm sorry to the middle

233
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,640
of April. I should clarify. What's happening from mid-April to mid-May? I'm not quite sure yet.

234
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:29,080
Starting in mid-May, we are going to be playing the almonds in theater in Los Angeles. And

235
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,800
that's going to take us through the entire summer. After that, we're not sure what's happening.

236
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,280
Or should I say, we are sure what's happening. We're just not allowed to say it yet. A third

237
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:44,200
production of Jersey Boys will be opening up in Chicago this fall. You can check out all the

238
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:51,240
information about the two touring casts at jerseyboystor.com. For information on the Broadway cast,

239
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:58,840
you can check out jerseyboysBroadway.com. There also isn't announcement coming about coming out soon

240
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,600
about my cast of Jersey Boys. We have a upcoming big appearance that Adam, I know I've told you about,

241
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,440
but don't say anything. I'll let you know when you can say something and you can tell to all your

242
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,040
viewers because it is going to be a blast. It's very exciting for all of us. The other thing I wanted

243
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,800
to mention is the person playing Frankie Valley that you saw was not actually Christopher Kale Jones,

244
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:25,080
like you had said. The person you saw was Jared Specter. We have an alternate actor who plays Frankie

245
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,960
Valley on Tuesday nights and Wednesday, Matt Nays because the role of Frankie Valley is so hard,

246
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:37,080
we give our normal guy a couple more days off than everyone else. Damn him. But it's just because

247
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,760
he has to sing 27 songs back to back all in his fall setto and it's really just a bit of a role.

248
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:49,800
So we need to give our Frankie some relaxation time. So yeah, that's pretty much it. And again,

249
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,440
thank you so much for coming. I'm so glad you enjoyed it. You can check out more information

250
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,880
on me at Eric, ERICH, Bergen, B-E-R-G-E-N dot com and check out my podcast, greenroomradio dot com.

251
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,360
And I know Adam you told him to go fuck podcasting, but I still like it way too much.

252
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,760
Oh and last before you get to that, let me just say a couple things because we're about to say

253
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:23,560
goodbye to our serious satellite listeners. Dude, you should be in the Broadway production.

254
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,600
I think you've got what it takes. Several other members of the cast that I saw as well, I would have

255
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:37,480
to say. In addition to that, if that wasn't the normal guy, holy crap, that's your backup guy.

256
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:45,560
He was good. And I really also like the casting of this, just in general, the way you guys look.

257
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,160
And it was fantastic. Again, my recommendation to go see the show.

258
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,520
A serious satellite radio listeners, thank you for sticking with me. I'll talk to you tomorrow with

259
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,920
who are Friday. Let's hear the last bit here from America, because it's a personal message.

260
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,640
You know, I should just say, I just talked to my mother and she's also a huge fan of your show.

261
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,920
And she was so excited to hear, you know, she literally screamed on the phone,

262
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:14,360
which she heard you talk about, Jersey was. She's a podcaster herself in a damn good one at that.

263
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:21,080
In fact, tomorrow, she is celebrating one year of podcasting. Her podcast is called craftcast.

264
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:28,520
It's at craftcast.com. That's craftcast.com. It's for anyone who's interested in crafting,

265
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:35,880
decopaging, knitting, sewing, you name it, whatever. It's a fantastic podcast if you're domestic,

266
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:42,520
like my mother. And it's you hot. Happy birthday, mom. You know, one year of podcasting.

267
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,640
Okay, Adam, that's about it for me. I have to go do two shows today. Good Lord.

268
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,280
That was not just in. Oh, and one more thing. Oh, Eric Bogen. Yeah, scruncher. Oh, wow.

269
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:03,880
It's surprising. Uh-huh. Hmm. Okay. This changes my view a bit on the scrunchers.

270
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,720
Hey, Eric Mac, good luck. Good luck to you. And thanks for the invite for coffee, but

271
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,240
it's just no fucking way. I just, I can't swing it. I'll be back probably in about three weeks.

272
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,880
Going to do a New York trip and then come back. I'm also going to a North Carolina

273
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:24,280
for a, and that's on the, was it the 9th, I think, or the 10th, or the 11th, I don't know what

274
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:35,240
date is. I have a special cameo in what will be the, the next episode of Port City, P.D.

275
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,840
So I'm quite flattered by that. I'm looking forward to going to North Carolina.

276
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,720
I'll, I have no idea how much time I'm going to have while I'm there. I have no idea. I haven't seen

277
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,400
a script. Maybe we don't have a script. Maybe I'm just getting killed. You know, I have no idea.

278
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,880
But if there is time, and maybe we can, you know, I'm sure there's people in North Carolina,

279
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:01,400
we can hang out with Sandra naked pictures. Let me see. There's a couple more things here.

280
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,120
You know, really stuff that I wanted to, I wanted to play during the sound light window.

281
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,400
I'm sorry. I was disgusting. Okay. I'll save all this for tomorrow. It's kind of good. You know,

282
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,320
it don't send me anything unless it's food bar specific stuff. Because I've got enough

283
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,080
promos. Don't send anything for tomorrow. Well, it doesn't matter. It's okay. Send me whatever you want.

284
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:30,040
It's just do whatever you want. Okay. Let's, uh, let's do this. I heard I, I, I,

285
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:45,080
it's not much more left than me. Uh, sorry. It's time to, uh, hold on. I know idea what that was.

286
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,920
But that, of course, is my, uh, is my first gen iPod. It's time for another track from Adam's

287
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,640
first gen iPod. As you know, I've got this iPod. I've had it since 2004. I haven't said,

288
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:02,200
I started working on this thing that turned out to be podcasting. There's all kinds of stuff on it.

289
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,200
There's everything from audiobooks to production elements to podcasts to some of my favorite songs

290
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,680
from the 70s because on this first iPod, this is where I put all the stuff that I collected on

291
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:19,320
Napster when it was still a thriving system. So, uh, without further ado, let me grab the first

292
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:30,760
gen iPod and hit play. It's completely at random. Oh, wow. It's going to be too long to play in the

293
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:38,600
whole show. But it's, it's a, it's a George Carlin live on HBO. Wow. That's the surprise. No music at all.

294
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Let's listen to the genius, the master. I bought this off audible.com. I remember that much.

295
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,920
Okay. Maybe just listen to, uh, opening piece then, okay?

296
00:28:52,520 --> 00:29:00,520
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. So,

297
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,440
let me ask you something. Let me ask you. How's everybody doing tonight? Hi.

298
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:15,800
Good. Well, fuck you. Just trying to make you feel at home.

299
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,320
Listen, I've been out here all this time, and I haven't been complaining about anything yet. So,

300
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:29,800
I think it's time to go into the complaint department. This is just a series of things that are

301
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,880
pissing me off. Okay. Let's just, let's just listen to this one together. Okay?

302
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,400
Please, that are pissing me off. Because I don't remember Thursdays. I have major psychotic fucking

303
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:47,160
hatreds, okay? And it makes the world a lot easier to sort out. First thing on my list tonight,

304
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:53,560
airport security tired of this shit. There's too much of it. There's too much security at the airport.

305
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,880
I'm tired of some guy with a double digit IQ and a triple digit income,

306
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,760
rooting around inside of my bag for no reason and never finding anything.

307
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,960
Haven't found anything yet. Haven't found one bomb in one bag. And don't tell me,

308
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,320
well, the terrorists know their bags are going to be searched, so now they're leaving their

309
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,520
bond at home. There are no bombs. The whole thing is fucking pointless.

310
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,000
It's completely without logic. There's no logic at all. They'll take away a gun but let you

311
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,720
keep a knife. Well, what the fuck is that? In fact, there's a whole list of lethal objects they

312
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,000
will allow you to take on board. Theoretically, you can take a knife, a knife, a nice pick, a hatchet,

313
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,640
a straight razor, a pair of scissors. Oh, this is so early. Oh, this is so early.

314
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,560
Knitting needles and a broken whiskey bottle. And the only thing they're going to say to you is

315
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,760
that bag has to fit all the way under the seat in front of you. That is kind of interesting, though.

316
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,320
I'll, I'm going to play a little bit more of this. And actually, I know that I've played this

317
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:57,320
on one of the early early early daily source codes. The title of the, the specialist, you're all

318
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:06,840
diseased. But clearly, this was a pre 9-11. Oh, kind of interesting, though, isn't it?

319
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,280
Of course, airport security still didn't work. He was right about that.

320
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,920
If you wouldn't take a weapon on board, relax. After you've been flying for about an hour,

321
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
they're going to bring you a knife and fork. They actually give you a fucking knife.

322
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,560
It's only a table knife, but you could kill a pilot with a table knife.

323
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,160
Might take you a couple of minutes, you know, especially if he's hefty, huh?

324
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,880
Yeah, but you could get the job done. You really want the killer prick.

325
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,080
Shit, there's a lot of things you could use to kill a guy with. You could probably beat a

326
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:52,920
guy to death with a Sunday New York Times, couldn't you? Or suppose you just had really big hands.

327
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,760
Couldn't you a straangle of flight attendant? Shit, you could probably straangle two of them one

328
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,000
with each hand. You know, if you were lucky enough to catch him in that little kitchen area,

329
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:07,800
before they give out the fucking peanuts, you know? But you can get the job done if you're really

330
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:14,440
cared enough. So why isn't they allow a man with big, powerful hands to get on board an airplane?

331
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:21,080
I'll tell you why. They know he's not a security risk because he's already answered the three

332
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,680
big questions. Question number one, did you pack your bags yourself?

333
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,080
No, carrot top pack my bags.

334
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,320
He and Martha Stewart and Florence Henderson came over to the house last night.

335
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,560
Fixed me a lovely lobster new bird gave me a full body massage with sacred oils from India

336
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,280
performed a four way around the world and then they packed my bags. Next question.

337
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,280
All right, that was a little bit from Adam's first gen iPod.

338
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,840
And since there was no music on that track, I'll play some for the young man.

339
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
That's a world of lamb ribs.

340
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:43,960
Hell felt like you were moving on, moving on to some new.

341
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,360
Feel something took out your heart. Hell is nothing you can do.

342
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,120
And you watch and know why I'm staying.

343
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,600
Oh, I'm feeling a sway. Hell yeah.

344
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,280
Hell my role to love you.

345
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,840
Hell my role to feel a little way I do.

346
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,040
Hell my role to love you.

347
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,320
Hell yeah how mature by a lot Saint's

348
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:40,360
No I know this is true.

349
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,840
So the screams got me getting into you.

350
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:53,320
Hell is nothing you can do.

351
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,760
And you watch and know why I'm staying.

352
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:27,760
