Another pod show pod guest.

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,440
Stink!

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,240
We interrupt the show for a special announcement from Pod Show HQ.

4

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,000

Now, back to the show!

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,240
The Jewish tradition holds that there are 613 meets vote, or commandments, that people should live by.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,840
Strictly following all 613 is a lofty goal, managing to do it is at best difficult from your humans.

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,320
But 613 episodes of the daily source code has simple task for the pod father and his disciples and savons.

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,400
Welcome to the DSC 1610 link.

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,560
You want some soup, you'll look hungry, and put on a sweater, will you?

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,000
You're making me cold.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,160
Have I told you about the pain in my ear?

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,880
Aye!

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,200
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,400
Turned me in!

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,200
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
We don't need no sticking turns me in.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,640
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
Fantastic! It's Adam Curry!

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,640
At the toe, Pacific Standard Time will be for 20.

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,440
Exactly.

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,080
Fly up, give me some rope, and I might just chill.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,320
But I'm the type that like to like the other joint.

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,520
Like Cypher Seal.

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,320
I still do these bellookees when I fall from me.

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,120
I got some bucks on it, but today I know from it.

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,440
Go get the S13 IDES.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
Nevertheless, I'm Ella Fresco.

37
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
They do it's like a cigarette.

38
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,080
So, plastic from the table, like pain from dumb gums.

39
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Be in my chest, like hey come.

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,160
It's on around my lips around the bone.

41
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,480
And when it comes to getting another stocky.

42
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,560
Bulls all here, like you know me.

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,760
Know me, I know me.

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,080
To begin with, let's go get me hands to beat.

45
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Fly by that my friend hip-width.

46
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,920
I'll let you pull out the fact, Chris.

47
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,680
Beat you five down the beer, warm the real before was history.

48
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,600
Cause we'll be having a vacuum, looms.

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,840
And if you let me, then before you, well, let down.

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,880
Da-da-da-da.

51
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,160
Oh, see you.

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,880
See you.

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:40,880
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:04:10,880
love you, my love, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,

55
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:34,280
I've got sex to the face whenever I can't don't be no crush. I'm so teed up to the

56
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,800
joy be burning my head next time I roll it in a half a tap on slow so the asses won't

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,360
be burning that my hand rock. Who's he still here but they know they got the pitch and then

58
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,600
I roll it short that's longer than your extension because I'll be dammit you get high

59
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,240
yours me for free. He'll know you better bring your old strip cheap. For some

60
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,320
don't babysit that man to pass the drawings. I think because you know you got asthma

61
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,920
crack the movie open homey and you're so late cause I know where my system is

62
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,400
getting lonely. I got to take the whizz test to my CEO. I know I'm the

63
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,320
author. I'm the smoke major weed throw and every time we request that full rolling up a

64
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:23,400
fatty but they'll take a race straight. I got me. I got my boy. I got my boy. I got my boy.

65
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:34,400
I do it. I got my boy. It's heavy stuff and I got my boy. I got my boy. I got my boy.

66
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:44,760
One of the left go out on the side. One more time to give the fair.

67
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,000
You just imagine flying over the clouds displaying softly in your headphones.

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,760
Which we want to order be like to fly while listening to Pink Floyd.

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Must try.

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,800
Then it's source code episode number 613 coming to you from the Curie Manor. Wow, it's been quite a

71
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,000
couple of days.

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,160
Hey, make this right man. Stop at the light. Make my yes the night bank.

73
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,280
Got me hold off the night train. You fade out. So let's head through the heat.

74
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,960
Take the shoulder that I know so we can throw big hatches. I wish I could

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,200
take the eight but I know what it's still over there to go. Let's get it.

76
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Just for a second.

77
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,560
Comes to us from art from mashupton.com. It's the voice dude for 20 and art was actually kind

78
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,400
of apprehensive about sending a two of me's like, dude, I don't want you to fall off the

79
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,920
wagon, I know.

80
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Yeah, not only the smoking, but

81
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
the smoke.

82
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,520
Of course, you'll find a link to that in the show note to daily source code.com.

83
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,880
Yeah, you know, speaking of speaking of the smoking, it's been going quite well, actually.

84
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:14,120
Although, wow, yesterday when I was alone here at home was Patricia was doing another

85
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,480
show in the Netherlands. Actually, I flew her over on Saturday and I flew back the same day,

86
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,840
which, of course, guess the the blood pumping, it was a beautiful day.

87
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,320
Christine was out in the town and I was just like walking around the house like, wow,

88
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,240
I'd really like to smoke right now. Luckily, I didn't.

89
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,000
I just had to send you my congrats on quitting smoking and offer up a word of warning.

90
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:46,200
I was a very heavy smoker. If I was conscious, I was smoking. The only time I didn't smoke was

91
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,080
when I was scuba diving and only then because I never figured out how to do it.

92
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,840
On May 11th, 1990, I stopped just like you called Turkey. It's not an easy thing to pull off,

93
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:06,440
so I appreciate what you're experiencing. But on DSC 612, I heard you mentioned that one of the ways

94
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:14,200
you distract yourself is to have something to eat and that is my warning to you. On May 11th, 1990,

95
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:22,200
the day I quit, I weighed 160 pounds. You met me in New York. You do the math.

96
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,880
I am no longer 11 16. Now I met you in New York as well and you could use a little meat on your

97
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,520
bone. Yeah. I know in 60. But I, on the ways you compensate. But aside from that, it's of course

98
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,720
wonderful that you've quit. Stay strong at him. It's a while before you forget the feeling.

99
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:47,400
Yeah. Patricia tells me after 16, 17 years she still has the feeling. What a great prospect

100
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:55,720
to look forward to. Let me see. Okay, so let me just fill in to Patricia's doing the show.

101
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,200
And today, of course, being Monday, I got up right in early. There was a lot of fog this

102
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,840
morning, but I went over first to Antwerp to go see the wind commander because the aircraft

103
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,640
has to go to the radio shop and get the radio fixed. And then from there to Amsterdam,

104
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,000
to pick up Patricia and then from Amsterdam back. And it was, well, it was pretty crappy weather.

105
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,480
I went over the top of the clouds across the channel, which was really nice because then, of course,

106
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:28,280
you're above the weather. And it's just nice and sunshine, just nice and calm air. That was wonderful.

107
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,520
Came in at Flight Level 50 over Ostenda, which is the Belgian coast. And there was just

108
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:42,600
huge cloud buildup, CBs, building up high into the sky above my altitude. So I said,

109
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,000
let me just corkscrew down for a second here. You know, like Flight Level 50, which is

110
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,880
over 5,000 feet down to 1,500 feet in just a matter of not really quick, but still really,

111
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:04,360
really misty. And bad weather on the way back, the channel was okay, but it got progressively worse

112
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,280
and we got into rain. It was just nasty. But I'm really happy with where I am with the flying

113
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:17,160
right now. I've got my everything is really under control. I feel at one with the aircraft. And it's

114
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,840
the same thing you have, you know, when you drive in a car or bike even, when you know, hey,

115
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,520
I have complete control of this thing. And whatever comes from outside of it, I am one with this

116
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,680
machine. And so whatever weather is going to hit me, whatever the conditions are, it's an extension of me.

117
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,320
And so, you know, immediately, the wind commander, you know, being the businessman that he is

118
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,000
recognized as this and says, hey, you know, we should think about a Seneca twin. And like,

119
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,760
okay, and there was one of the airfield, and we got back to Ferrox and Patricia saw it. She's like,

120
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,800
yeah, I do kind of like that club seating in the back, you know? It looks nice.

121
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,680
We're going to see you here, by the way, before I left this morning. Oh baby,

122
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,320
I'm going to buy it. Oh, you are so good. It's nothing to do with you, by the way.

123
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,280
A little baby.

124
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,760
What is that?

125
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,160
Very good. Sometimes you want them to suck more. Sometimes you don't.

126
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,120
Suckless.potsho.com. Just don't tell you, girlfriend.

127
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,680
Bronco.

128
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,080
Rockacity, Talia, you're killing me, man.

129
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,400
It's a very funny one.

130
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,520
Oh, yeah, a lot of talk over the weekend in the blogosphere about the Suckless survey. Actually,

131
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,560
not about the survey so much. And the Suckless zone more about the the first spot we ran, the

132
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,200
long one.

133
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,400
Yeah, learned. Learn from this.

134
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,040
Must do better. Right now we have about I think eight of them in rotation. And this is really

135
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,600
good exercise because we're coming to understand a number of things. We already had a special

136
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:05,880
being set aside for family friendly shows. There's also people who are interested in explicit

137
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,920
non-explicit because, you know, and you really comes down to taste and it's personal taste. I guess

138
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,760
there's no clear cut rules as to, you know, when is something offensive, when is something

139
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,840
not family friendly? And please don't send me all kinds of examples because everyone has their

140
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:29,080
own version of examples. You know, where is that fine line? So learning a lot about what people want.

141
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,080
Mainly from podcasts, as I must say, haven't heard a lot from, actually, I have heard something

142
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,960
from a listener, hold on. Hey, Adam. This is part seven H.G. I just got finished listening to

143
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:48,360
episode 612. It was great. I also went and took the survey and put my new board to sleep.

144
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:59,080
It was a pretty standard marketing survey and I didn't take too long, but I think some of the,

145
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,800
especially the first questions were confusing me a little bit, but I did have a screaming kid at the time.

146
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,880
Anyway, uh, will you the best and love the daily source code? And hopefully, uh, get a

147
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:16,120
here lady Patricia on your show here in the new feature. So anyway, take care and have a good week.

148
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,520
Bye bye. All right, man. Thank you so much. Now, unfortunately, no lady Patricia for the next two

149
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,800
weeks. I know. I know it's almost enough reason to unsubscribe, but I'll be leaving tomorrow morning

150
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,000
630 a.m. leaving the house to go to New York, being New York for the rest of the week,

151
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,680
San Francisco the week after that, and then I come home, and then we'll have sex.

152
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,200
Oh, yeah, we'll do a show. Oh, in the meantime, though, she came back and she had a whole bunch of

153
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,840
tracks that her record label, the one that, uh, that's so kindly released the, uh, the medley

154
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:57,480
2007 remix of the Star Sisters, they're going to, uh, to release it to the pot to have music network. I'm

155
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,880
sorry, um, they're going to release a number of other tracks, pot safe. So let's see what happens.

156
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,280
And it's some really good stuff. She has an amazing back catalog. I've all, I've been waiting for

157
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,320
this moment, you know, finally people are waking up, and it's low and behold, it's my wife's

158
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,280
record label. Of course, it's a very small label, and really one guy calls all the shots, and, uh, and,

159
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,400
you know, I don't even think that he gives a shit if his company makes any money. He's just

160
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,200
been doing it for so long. He, it's in his blood. He can't stop it. Um, you know, so he takes care of

161
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,640
all the rights for everything, which is amazing. Uh, so that will be in the near future. Hey, uh, for those

162
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:42,600
of you who've been listening since, uh, probably since before we were counting, uh, before we were

163
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:49,400
now, now we were counting, I guess, uh, one of the, one of my favorite bands, uh, which, I think

164
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,000
they wasn't before the pod save music network, but, uh, that I played a lot in the early daily

165
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
source code, uh, days, uh, is a Dutchman called Mo Jones. Uh, when I did radio show there for about a

166
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,560
year, um, they were on my show, they performed live. These guys are great. They do everything on

167
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,000
pro tools in their attic. It's just, you know, three guys, uh, I think two of them are brothers.

168
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,480
Hmm, can't quite remember. It doesn't matter. Uh, Mo Jones M-O-O-Postrophe J-O-N-E-S, and they've

169
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,920
released a new record. Um, it's not on the pod save music network yet. I'm, uh, I'm going through

170
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,520
all the, uh, every pod cast who's trying to get a band on the pod save music network goes through

171
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,720
this and you explain it and, you know, you do a couple emails back and forth and, uh, eventually

172
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,880
when, you know, when someone plays it, then everyone involved is so happy that the reward is

173
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,720
just immense. So they did send me a track to play on the show. I want you to check these guys out.

174
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:50,520
Hey you. Oh, Jones. On the Charlie D.S.D. 613.

175
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:18,920
I would want to set you free in the name of you. Hey you. Wake up.

176
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:28,600
Sometimes you look back and forth. Hey you. Come out. Sometimes it's good to be someone.

177
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Hey you. You could try to keep it for you. And that's the same way to you.

178
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:55,480
I'm lucky I thought I'd fly the show on my own night night. I promise I'll forget. Tell me

179
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:08,680
not to be afraid. Tell me, shall we come out for you? Get me. Hey you. Wake up. Sometimes you look back and forth.

180
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:15,080
Hey you. Come out. Sometimes it's good to be someone.

181
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:07,880
Hey you. Wake up. Sometimes you look back and forth. Hey you. Come out. Sometimes it's good to be someone.

182
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:21,480
Hey you. Wake up. Sometimes you look back and forth. Hey you. Come out. Sometimes it's good to be someone.

183
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:57,920
Hey you. Hey you. Hey you. Hey you. Hey you. Hey you. Hey you. Wake up. Wake up.

184
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:12,160
Hey you. Wake up. Sometimes you look back and forth. Hey you. Come out. Sometimes it's good to be someone.

185
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:23,360
Hey you. Wake up. Sometimes it's good to be someone.

186
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,960
Oh my gosh. Rojoans from their new album Mid-Legged angry young man. That's hey you.

187
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Unfortunately, we used to be proud of this stuff. Unfortunately exclusive on the daily source code.

188
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,280
I used to be a big deal. Exclusive only here. Now I'm like bummed out. I want everyone to be able to play this.

189
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:51,320
So, still working on that. You can check them out at mojones.nl. Mike Oscar. Juliet Oscar November echo cierra dot no.

190
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:58,400
November Lima. Hey James, who was kind of very close to savon status and maybe he truly

191
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,280
is a savon because he comes up with the most brilliant ideas without even knowing it.

192
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,600
Adam James, I felt compelled to ring this afternoon. I'm just driving home from work and

193
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,640
it's about half an hour journey from where I was at home. I thought I've got no podcasts

194
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,440
on the iPods this morning or last night. Bit more recent at the same tracks on the

195
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:26,480
night, but all the same. So I'll pop the radio on. Yep. As soon as we start at all on the

196
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,480
radio, I don't know. It wouldn't be surprising here. I thought I'd be able to load a

197
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,800
estate anyway. But the podcast is goodbye. So it's almost perfect James because I was very

198
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,840
interested in hearing what site was on the radio at the time. And that would have

199
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,000
been cool. So could you do that next time and just like scan through the dial, don't

200
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,440
take a long time doing it. I'm just talking like, you know, just let me hear if there's a song

201
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:57,160
playing or the topic of conversation move on to the next station. That's kind of cool, man. If

202
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,920
you're going to need ideas, there's a couple numbers you can use to call in. Use the plus

203
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:23,560
for extra savings. If you can't tell Adam from Patricia when it comes to French

204
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:31,640
retro music, listen to Radio Ola La, the French retro podcast. Radio Ola La, the

205
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:40,680
France retro podcast. I like very much. James, what of James sent me here? Oh yeah, this was

206
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:47,080
interesting. An ancient plant. Oh my ear, it's just sorry about that. I may become new source

207
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:56,280
of biofuel. I'd never heard of this. The Camelina. It's a plant that flourished almost three

208
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,240
and a half thousand years ago in Europe. If planted on a large scale on marginal farmland

209
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,320
from Eastern Washington to North Dakota, could provide a significant source of clean energy.

210
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,560
So apparently this is really potent stuff. And it produces more seeds,

211
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,200
can produce more oil from its seeds for lower price. It doesn't require I presume they mean

212
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:25,880
than any other type of bio crop. It doesn't require the excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides,

213
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,120
and herbicides. Not as kind of cool. I guess we've been looking for something like that.

214
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:39,640
Oh, man, it's so much happening. Between that and trading carbon deficits, it's a lot of things

215
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,320
to think of, including where to live. Adam, atomic rod atoms here, your listeners have been

216
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,640
suggesting locations for pocho germany. This morning, I came across a rotor's article about

217
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,200
a town that really needs your help. If you want a location on the other side of the tracks,

218
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,520
you need to put German pocho office in Buxberg, Oxford City is located in the former East

219
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,040
Germany. His population is strong from 3,000 people down to 1,500 so there should be a lot of cheap

220
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,880
vacant space available. Never fear those. The town's economy is looking up.

221
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,000
That in fall is investing 800 million euros in an upgrade to the massive brown coal plant located

222
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,400
there. After this complete, the town will be producing 17 million tons in CO2 every year.

223
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,160
Watch as New Market has a government that agreed to phase out as nuclear power plants.

224
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,320
According to the rotors article, that in fall's new addition is simply part of the electrical

225
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,360
generating capacity that we needed to replace a zero-mission nuclear plant. You will need to

226
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,640
consider boxwork instead of meaningful women. You can have a city where the trees are coated with

227
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,200
the yellowish ash and the town covered with an offloader and cool. If you have a great visit to

228
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,760
Germany but go soon, the flying might get a little less enjoyable once the country starts sucking

229
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,120
more coal out of the ground and blowing more waste into the air.

230
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,120
Hi, doesn't sugarcoat. It does it there. Atomic rods, savant of the Charlie. I wonder

231
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:02,360
remind you that I have a video podcast which has started crank up just a little bit. It's called

232
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,120
perversion for profit and it's more like a place where I test my video things.

233
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,960
And Cas Blaster Mike has created a new program. It's been in beta for a while now. It's called

234
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:20,680
Vid Blaster. I'm more information go to vidblaster.com, Victor India Delta, Vid Blaster.

235
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:28,680
And so I think he's getting pretty close to releasing a public beta. And this thing,

236
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:36,440
once again, it's a complete different approach to the typical production tool just as

237
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:44,520
where Cas Blaster really has become a little online on-air studio right on your box in your

238
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:55,080
own box. Vid Blaster, I can't do it not explain it. But essentially, it lets you create a video podcast

239
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,400
in a very similar manner as Cas Blaster. You can load up videos and you can plug in as many,

240
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,840
I think as many USB cameras as you want to, which is awesome because you can actually switch

241
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,520
between cameras. It's really cool. Doesn't have an external mixer yet, which you know is something

242
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,360
I want. But you'll have to try it out when it comes out. It's hard to explain, but it really produces

243
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:24,840
a great, it enables you to produce a great video podcast, which looks really professional

244
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,160
because it's just all fit together and it just kind of works, typical mic fashion.

245
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:39,160
So go to pfppopa, fox trot, popa, pfp.podshow.com. You can check out what I've been doing.

246
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:46,600
Basically, if I just shoot any video anywhere, now I have a way to throw it up onto the delivery network

247
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:52,680
because it will automatically upload to podshow, just like Cas Blaster. So all you have to do is

248
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:59,080
fill in your, was it your email address that you used when you signed up and your password and then

249
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,880
you can hit record from there, you can load up clips, play those, whatever when you're done,

250
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,560
you just, you save it to your drive and you say, upload it to podshow and it goes off to your account.

251
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:15,400
And if you have multiple shows, there's a selector there, drop down box and you can select

252
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,920
which show it should be uploaded to. It's awesome. It really is vidblaster.com is where you

253
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,840
can check out the information. I don't think you can get into the close bait anymore. In fact,

254
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,880
I know you can't, but the public bait it should be coming very soon.

255
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,560
Hey, Adam, it's Kevin Crossman. You know, I haven't been a, you know, a complete fan of the

256
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,680
all music football Fridays because I just love your regular shows during the week and, you know,

257
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:44,520
sometimes the musical selection isn't the greatest, but let me tell you the one from last Friday,

258
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:51,880
today, man, you know, if you can have that kind of music every week, let me have a full bar Friday,

259
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:58,520
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday too, just an outstanding selection in music. Just, just really great.

260
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,320
And by the way, congratulations for pulling the OCR out of your ass. I wonder what else is up there.

261
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,960
Anyway, you're listening to what you interested. We have at fratpackpotcast.com, a series of

262
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,920
audio interviews from the stars of the new hit comedy movie knocked up, so you might want to check

263
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,080
up and let's see, I'm a full, but you know what, I'm not a folder,

264
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,720
got to be in it, I'm not going to fall into the pure pressure and, you know what,

265
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,040
I'm at the pressure and I'm proud of it, you know, I'm a good man to worry about. It's all good.

266
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,080
If you like Friday's football show, you'll love this. I also recommend it by jersey top.

267
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,300
Let's keep fighting!

268
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,180
Definitely, this summer is 2017, just.

269
00:27:46,180 --> 00:28:04,980
2018, where should I live?

270
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,080
I want you to see how I get down so now we take this

271
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,080
And I can see my muscles to the sound she wants from me

272
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,080
No penalty, you know how to bounce, I'm gonna take that chance, bitch

273
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,080
I'm going back love to her, yeah

274
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,080
One of the things we need to get you out of the fun of things

275
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,080
One of the things and nothing break it all

276
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,080
It's kind of piss, it's like I'm finding things I never saw

277
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,080
But no, I got it, just my arms, the song's so close

278
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,080
It's feel good, feel good

279
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,080
It's that old soul, it's not your bones, it's real, it's real, I feel good

280
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Now you want more, you need to get that chance, these songs is powerful

281
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,080
These beats, these songs is powerful

You doing the feel, you're like that, don't you but

Watch out for the photos too, because that's what count on you, you better move

285
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Not as much cheddar but still a better groove, we gotta warm that he hold harder, not ready

286
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,080
Way black, ready to vote, cause I know you got slow, I won't

287
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,080
Now let's skip money, money, keep a lock down, plan to take from me

288
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,080
They all want to find the things, yeah, yeah

289
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,080
Find the things we need to get you out of the fun of things

290
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,080
Things and what they break it always, and look business

291
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
Find the things I know, the songs, yeah, yeah

292
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,080
I got it, just my arms, the song's so close

293
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Find the things we need to get you out of the fun of things

294
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,080
Find the things and what they break it always, and look business

295
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
Find the things I know, the song's so close

296
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,080
Find the things we need to get you out of the fun of things

297
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Find the things we need to get you out of the fun of things

298
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,080
Find the things we need to get you out of the fun of things

299
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,080
Find the things we need to get you out of the fun of things

300
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,080
Find the things they break it always, and look business

301
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Find the things we need to get you out of the fun

302
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,400
And there's a link and it says do you naughty naughty boy?

303
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,600
Yeah, I've had very bad experiences with just playing stuff on the show before listening to it

304
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,680
What do you say

305
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,440
Should we do it? Yeah, I know what to help us do it. Oh, man. Let me open up the second channel here

306
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,920
Adam. Why do you always have to be so darn naughty?

307
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,120
I want to really appreciate they played motherless child. That's a close-out song on the DSC on Friday

308
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,600
I didn't appreciate you saying that the picture I sent you was naked when it said really was not

309
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,480
It's show business. I'm putting out a little show, Angie

310
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,640
Just a set the record straight. I want to head and upload it the vintage

311
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
lingerie pin up

312
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,520
So airlessness can all set us by their curiosity and check it out

313
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,520
How are you being like calls about it, Angie?

314
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,560
Why not you just play along with the game?

315
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:39,080
It should be calm. I made a blog about it and I also put my those child up on the podcast if music network

316
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,120
Yeah, so all the podcasts are listening can feel free to play it on their shows as well

317
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,160
So I don't know why you had to exaggerate you naughty naughty naughty boy

318
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,560
It wasn't it wasn't exaggerating. It was a daydreaming. You know that

319
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
All right, so

320
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,960
I don't think maybe a show tomorrow night from New York

321
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,360
I don't know because the minute I hit town it straight off to meetings. This is

322
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,920
It's time once again once a quarter we're off to New York

323
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,040
It's the big sales meetings. A lot of interest for our sports channel which will be announcing very soon

324
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
So it'll be there. We'll be there all week everybody

325
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:22,320
So I'm not quite sure when the show will be out tomorrow, but it would be it would be nice if I could get one out tomorrow evening

326
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,280
Until then, daily source code calm is where you can find the show notes and see a relevant links to everything discussed on today's program
