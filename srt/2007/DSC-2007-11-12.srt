00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,720
And we'll show it

15
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
I'll show it

16
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
I'll show it all

17
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
I'll show it all

18
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
I'll show it all

19
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
I'll show it all

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
I'll show it all

21
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
I'll show it all

22
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
This is the worst scene

23
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,720
I think you're making fun of me

24
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
I listen to the worst scene

25
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,720
I'll know where you...

26
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Let's pretend that they are now

27
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Say what you can do

28
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
I'll show it all

29
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,720
I'll show it all

30
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:21,440
We got to Georgia, my life's

31
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:37,720
Oh man, it's hard to soundtrack to my life for the past 25 years.

32
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Frankie goes to Hollywood to tribes.

33
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,720
On Delta, Sierra Charlie's 684 coming to you from the Curry Manor.

34
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
We're back in Blighty.

35
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Hey everybody how you doing?

36
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,720
I actually had that song lined up to play for the Fubar Friday.

37
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,720
In fact I had pretty much a whole Fubar Friday lined up.

38
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,720
At the time I was home Friday and my partner in crime on the No Agenda show.

39
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,720
John C. DuBourke had been waiting for probably about two hours for me to hook up with Skype

40
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,720
and do our No Agenda show, which is a lot easier for me because I can just sit there

41
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,720
and just listen to him and talk some shit back and forth.

42
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
I was spent.

43
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
I had nothing left.

44
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
I had no more energy.

45
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
I'm so sorry.

46
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
So I'll keep a lot of that stuff.

47
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,720
I just could not hold back on playing this because even though it was written and performed

48
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,720
over 25 years ago, it still holds true today.

49
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,720
If you listen to the lyrics and feel the vibe.

50
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Nice guys, by the way, Frankie goes to Hollywood.

51
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
I hung out with Holly Johnson quite a bit in Amsterdam.

52
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,720
I think they recorded the follow-up album I believe to this.

53
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,720
They recorded in the vis-a-lored studios in Hilversum.

54
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,720
And the bass player is kind of weird.

55
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
But Holly is a real nice guy.

56
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,720
And I know he's around somewhere in the UK.

57
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,720
This is one of the worst things ever.

58
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,720
At one point, there was a news report that he had died in an airplane crash.

59
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
I can't remember which one it was.

60
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Some big horrific crash.

61
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
And he was supposed to be on it.

62
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
But he wasn't.

63
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
And I think a lot of people still think he is dead.

64
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
But he's not.

65
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Anywho.

66
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,720
My goodness.

67
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
It's been quite a trip.

68
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Saturday morning.

69
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Got up.

70
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
I did my usual routine.

71
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Of course, I was going to leave for the airport early afternoon to fly back.

72
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
I just got to tell you a bit about this.

73
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,720
First of all, I'm writing all this stuff and I'm online on the MacBook Pro, which

74
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Oh, man.

75
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
I love this thing so much.

76
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,720
I got a happy MacBook Pro story to tell you.

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
So I'm writing away.

78
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,720
And then, you know how if you unplug your Mac, then the screen dims just slightly.

79
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,720
But it can also happen if the light, if the ambient light changed a bit, your screen

80
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
will change in brightness.

81
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Which is to adjust, of course, for whatever situation you're in.

82
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Did realize that happened from moment and then I say, hey, wait a minute.

83
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
My Mac is disconnected from from the wireless networks.

84
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,720
I'm hunting around that I can't find the wireless network.

85
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
And I don't understand it.

86
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,720
In fact, I don't see any wireless networks.

87
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
And then it hit me.

88
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,720
I was, of course, doing my laundry, which, you know, this guys, if you ever have the opportunity

89
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,720
to come home from a long trip with your laundry freshly done, guaranteed blow job time.

90
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
I'm telling you.

91
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
So I'm doing my laundry.

92
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
And I said, wait a minute, I don't hear the dryer anymore.

93
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Well, the power had gone off in the building.

94
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Yeah.

95
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,720
So I'm like, I'll just write for a little bit longer.

96
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,720
I was writing in, uh, in Gmail.

97
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,720
So, um, you know, I did all probably already auto saved half of my email.

98
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
And I'll just continue.

99
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,720
So I wrote for about another half hour, 12 to 12 30.

100
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
And I still know power, right?

101
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Because that, of course, is what happened is the power went off.

102
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,720
And the same is disconnected my power cord.

103
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
And I'm like, well, yeah, I'm going to find out what's going on.

104
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Because I do want to post this message.

105
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,720
I was actually a message to a number of pod show producers.

106
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,720
And so I do, I do the select all Apple key all.

107
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,720
I select the text I've been writing just in case, right?

108
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Because it hadn't, it hadn't been able to auto saves since I had no net connection.

109
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Posted it into a text, uh, was it simple text or text edit document.

110
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,720
It used to be simple text, teach text.

111
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Now I think it's just text edit.

112
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
And I just leave it there on the screen.

113
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,720
I call the downstairs to the concierge.

114
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Oh, man, no, the whole block's out.

115
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
They expected to be out for a couple hours.

116
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,720
And indeed, by the time I left a 23245,

117
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
it still did not come on, which was a real bummer

118
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,720
because I wanted to set up the I Mac there with back to my Mac.

119
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,720
But of course, I should have done that one before before the day of departure.

120
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Um, and then I'm like, well, you know what?

121
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,720
I still, so between 12 30 and 230, I still had some time.

122
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Like, you know, let me show you if I can figure if I can hook it up

123
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
to my cell phone.

124
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
So I'm mucking around, right?

125
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
And, and of course, I did something wrong.

126
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
This configured.

127
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,720
I didn't have the right information for the, for the, uh, for the cell phone provider.

128
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,720
And somehow the Mac locked up.

129
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Now this is not such a big deal.

130
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
It does happen, particularly when doing Bluetooth shit.

131
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
I mean, this happens.

132
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,720
It happens with all PCs that it just gets confused.

133
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
I don't know what it's doing.

134
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
It'll lock everything up.

135
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,720
And then I realized that that text document that I had posted this, you know,

136
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
like an hour and a half worth of writing work into.

137
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
I hadn't saved it.

138
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
It was still sitting there as untitled.

139
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
But I couldn't save it.

140
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I couldn't do anything to get out of it.

141
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
And I'm like, fuck.

142
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
You know, so just fuck it restart the fucking thing.

143
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
So I'm pissed.

144
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
I'm like, ah, shit.

145
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
By the way, I, at that point, I was sitting at the window.

146
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,720
I found, uh, some kind of wireless network.

147
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Since the building was out, it was pretty easy to get some further signals

148
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,720
and connect.

149
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,720
And like, okay, I'll just start all over again.

150
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Let me see how much Gmail has saved.

151
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,720
And of course, it had saved about half of it.

152
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
And check this out.

153
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,720
I fire up, text edit.

154
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Am I document fucking reappears?

155
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
If reappears on the screen.

156
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm like, fuck you Steve Jobs.

157
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
You make some awesome shit.

158
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
I'm really, really digging it.

159
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Hello Adam.

160
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
This is Ranger Craig from the lock.

161
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Normally, but unfortunately, for the past five days,

162
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,720
I've been working with our instant command team,

163
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,720
dealing with the oil spill here in the Bay Area.

164
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
So for those of you who hadn't heard about it,

165
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,720
oil tanker hit the bridge in San Francisco and started to leak oil.

166
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Of course, Ranger Craig was the first one to welcome

167
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
me back to San Francisco at the beginning of last week.

168
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
And he's the, the first one to, well,

169
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
welcome me back home with this horrible message.

170
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,720
So please pay attention because Ranger Craig does need some help.

171
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
As does the city of San Francisco.

172
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
I'm calling you.

173
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,720
I know you have a lot of listeners in the San Francisco Bay Area.

174
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,720
And if you could let them know,

175
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
we need help.

176
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,720
It's starting to come together here in terms of using volunteers.

177
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Folks that live in San Francisco,

178
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,720
called for you on one to find out more information about volunteering,

179
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,720
helping with the stillking up and bird rescues.

180
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Other folks can visit the website for alcatraz,

181
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
or the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.

182
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
That's nps.gov slash alcatraz,

183
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,720
or nps.gov slash GEOGA.

184
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,720
And they can probably link to get more information.

185
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,720
It's really important that people don't try to deal with the oil,

186
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
touch it, or come into contact with it.

187
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
It is really, really toxic stuff.

188
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
I mean stuff.

189
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,720
So let them know that they should get some training

190
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,720
and get a little orientation for going out there to help.

191
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
And that's the way they can help.

192
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Again, go to the Park Service website for Golden Gate,

193
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,720
or alcatraz, called for you on one of the living San Francisco.

194
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,720
And help us try to clean up this basket for the take years.

195
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,720
To recover from this, they've already cancelled,

196
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,720
or are talking about canceling crab season this year.

197
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
It was a bad spell, but not as bad as it could be,

198
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,720
but we can go and help with it and get it.

199
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
And I thought you might be one of the people

200
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
that can help get that word out.

201
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,720
So hopefully I'll be back from the rock in the near future.

202
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,720
And the meantime is along from San Francisco Bay.

203
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
All right, Ranger Craig.

204
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Thank you very much, my friend.

205
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
I'm sorry.

206
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
I couldn't be there to help myself.

207
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
I'd love to have done anything I can.

208
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
So of course, if you're in San Francisco,

209
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,720
you want to help call 3101 or go to the website.

210
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Ranger Craig mentioned to see if you can contribute.

211
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Yeah, I actually looked at some of the new sites,

212
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
looking for some more information on this.

213
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
I mean, it's a bad accident.

214
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,720
It's a nasty ecological issue that is taking place.

215
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
And what is the new show me?

216
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Britney Spears runs red light with kids in the car.

217
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Fuck you, journalist.

218
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
You all suck ass.

219
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Hey, Adam.

220
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
This is Scott from Dallas.

221
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,720
The booth next to your show yesterday.

222
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,720
And you were talking about, and I can't remember which DSCA was,

223
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,720
but you were talking about how some people are telling you to lighten it up.

224
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,720
And I know comic strip blogger said something about that as well.

225
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,720
But I wanted you to know that I had fallen off listening

226
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
on a regular basis for the last few months.

227
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,720
And just again, and I have just blown away by the value

228
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,720
that you spot taxes delivery now.

229
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
So I appreciate you being political.

230
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,720
And I appreciate you bringing some new insight to the things

231
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
that are going on all around this.

232
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,720
And I just want to say, from Dallas, you fuck you, Adam.

233
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Yeah.

234
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
And that's okay.

235
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
And this is what I say to lots of people.

236
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
It's okay.

237
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
You don't have to listen to every single episode.

238
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
You can pick it up somewhere, really.

239
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
And you may not understand some of the little things

240
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
that are popping throughout the conversation.

241
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
But you'll pick up on it.

242
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,720
Sometimes people say, you're doing, you're not doing this.

243
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
You don't do this anymore.

244
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
You show us become this.

245
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
You show us become that.

246
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
You become this.

247
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
I'm unsubscribing.

248
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
It's like, go ahead.

249
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
It's okay.

250
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
You're allowed to drop out.

251
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
There's nothing that says, you know,

252
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,720
just because, you know, you started that you have to come back

253
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
every single day.

254
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
It's really believed me.

255
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
It's totally okay.

256
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Not a big problem.

257
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,720
During that call, I got a call from super super chief head sales

258
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Weasel, Chris Jacob.

259
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,720
He's in things in Berlin today and we're meeting on Wednesday.

260
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
I'm pretty excited about this.

261
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
We're meeting in Helsinki.

262
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
I'm going up to Finland.

263
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Oh, yeah.

264
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Yeah.

265
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
We have a meeting with the Nokia folks, which I'm pretty excited about.

266
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
So looking forward to that.

267
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
I don't think I've ever been to Helsinki.

268
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,720
No, in fact, I'm positive I've never been to Helsinki.

269
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
And if it wasn't such short notice,

270
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
I'd consider taking the Delta Sierra up.

271
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Although it's just looking at the weather report.

272
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,720
It's like snow minus four for Wednesday,

273
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,720
minus seven or minus eight degrees expected on Thursday.

274
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,720
I don't even know if the Delta Sierra's heater can handle that.

275
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
So that'll be fun.

276
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Let me see.

277
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
We got lots of stuff to do today.

278
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Since since I missed Thursday and Friday,

279
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
got some cool feedback from you guys.

280
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,720
And of course, I have to catch up myself a little bit

281
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
on the Fubar Friday.

282
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,720
That means time for the hit test.

283
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,720
I'm growing casting with Adam Curry.

284
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,720
I Adam, who are you ready to be stumped?

285
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Oh, yeah.

286
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,720
Because he used the hit test with young problem.

287
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Hey, Adam.

288
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
This is hit test number 95.

289
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Yes.

290
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
And here we go with intro number one.

291
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Bring it on, man.

292
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,720
That's something my intelligence here.

293
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Instead of course, as my old piano Miss Diana Ross,

294
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,720
you can't slip that one by me.

295
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Easy, easy.

296
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Number two.

297
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Oh, another fit young.

298
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
This isn't hard.

299
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
This is fantastic.

300
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Go over Washington, Junior.

301
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
I'm just a two of us.

302
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Oh, man.

303
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
I'm going to get three out of three again.

304
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Bring on number three, young.

305
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
And number three.

306
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,720
And it's like something from those SOS Band days.

307
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
I don't know.

308
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
I'm going to give it up on three.

309
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
And time's up in these ID answers.

310
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,720
Answer number one is from 1980.

311
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
This is Diana Ross.

312
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Oh, yeah.

313
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
My old piano.

314
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
My baby is 10.

315
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
We'll live on my party.

316
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
But still be 10.

317
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
And I'll be 10.

318
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
No, be as cold.

319
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
My old piano.

320
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
It's 80 in case my.

321
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,720
And this is answer number two from 1981.

322
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Bill Witterson.

323
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Grow for Washington.

324
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,720
I see the crystal rain drops fall.

325
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
And the beauty of it all is when the sun comes shining.

326
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
All right, sing along now.

327
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Just the two of us.

328
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,720
We can make it if we try.

329
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
Just the two of us.

330
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,720
And the beauty of it all is when the sun comes shining.

331
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,720
All right, sing along now.

332
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Just the two of us.

333
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,720
We can make it if we try.

334
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Just the two of us.

335
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Just the two of us.

336
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Just the two of us.

337
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Building castles in the sky.

338
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
Just the two of us.

339
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Bill Witterson.

340
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
You and I.

341
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
Thank you for watching.

342
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Just the two of us.

343
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Answer number two.

344
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
What's the third one?

345
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,720
And this is answer number three from 1987 ABC.

346
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Offer on an early age.

347
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
A look of what?

348
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
No.

349
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
To me.

350
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
To me.

351
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
To me.

352
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
To me.

353
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
To me.

354
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
It's cold.

355
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Oh, it's cold.

356
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Moonlight.

357
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
Love died.

358
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
There we go.

359
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
I got it.

360
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
On the night.

361
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Moonlight.

362
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Earthlight.

363
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
It's cold.

364
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Outside.

365
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Moonlight.

366
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Love died.

367
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
On the night.

368
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
You.

369
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
The ABC and the night you murdered love.

370
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
There's answer number three.

371
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
It says number nine.

372
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Not even close.

373
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
Try to three.

374
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
So Adam, how did you do?

375
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
I had two out of three.

376
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
It's been better.

377
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
It's not too bad.

378
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
The answer said to this hit test.

379
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
And also the iTunes link.

380
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
So you can buy these tricks online.

381
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Can be found at hittest.pharchio.com.

382
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Next week, I'll be back for hittest number 96.

383
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
So until then, take care.

384
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
And bye-bye.

385
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
To be back.

386
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Hittest.

387
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
And she will.com.

388
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
info.

389
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Y'all.com.

390
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,720
J.N.B.O.L.D.P.

391
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
D.S.

392
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Ah.

393
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
The infamous Y'all.

394
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
So we'll have another one on Friday.

395
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
If I get to the football Friday.

396
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Which should work out?

397
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Because it'll be back Thursday from Finland.

398
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
And we can do a regular Friday show.

399
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Thank you very much.

400
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
I'm working towards episode number 100.

401
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Not bad.

402
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Mom.

403
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Mom.

404
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Mom.

405
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Ah.

406
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
I told you.

407
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
I had chief sales with Chris Jacob in Germany.

408
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
And Berlin.

409
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Here's a.

410
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
I think a voice mail comment from Germany.

411
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Hello.

412
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Adam.

413
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Sales guy.

414
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
You from Germany.

415
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Ah, of course.

416
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Sales guy.

417
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
You.

418
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Adam.

419
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
I was selling something today.

420
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
And I was just thinking.

421
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
How do you.

422
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
How does sports show make money?

423
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
Could you explain the thing?

424
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Is that just.

425
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Do you just make money?

426
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Based on advertisements?

427
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Or do you also develop applications that you sell to companies?

428
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,720
I'm just curious to find out.

429
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
You know how.

430
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
How sports show can be used.

431
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,720
So you can afford your luxurious lifestyle.

432
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Yeah.

433
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
Would be great if it gives me some insight.

434
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Yeah.

435
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Think deep.

436
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
All right.

437
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
Sales guy.

438
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
You.

439
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Well, first of all, I actually pay for most of my own luxurious lifestyle.

440
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
I hate to say it.

441
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Because I've worked pretty hard for the past couple of decades.

442
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,720
So most of that I take care of myself.

443
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Yeah.

444
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
We have three ways of making money.

445
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
Might as well tell you right now.

446
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
And I'm not ashamed of it.

447
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Very proud of it.

448
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
In fact, we syndicate.

449
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Our platform our content.

450
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,720
So that's one way to make money is by our deal as an example in the United Kingdom with.

451
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
I British telecom.

452
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
That's just one way.

453
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
Really.

454
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
It's advertising.

455
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,720
It's going to be a large chunk of our business model.

456
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,720
And we're getting better at it every single day.

457
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
There's another.

458
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,720
There's another category of making money, which we do.

459
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Which actually does quite well for us.

460
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
And I think we're going to do a lot.

461
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,720
No, I know we're going to do a lot more of it in 2008.

462
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,720
We're just loosely calling it seller payment.

463
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,720
And the best example of it right now is go daddy.

464
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,720
And in fact, I got a nudge from the guys from from the guys at HQ that I haven't been

465
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
keeping up my go daddy quota.

466
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,720
The way this works is, and this has this I have to tell you that seller payment.

467
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,720
I eat the idea of me promoting products or services in my show.

468
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,720
However, I feel fit.

469
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
And then essentially, well, I don't get paid.

470
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,720
But anyone else on the pod show network who participates does get paid.

471
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
My money goes straight back into the pod.

472
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
So that's another way pod show makes money.

473
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Is by signing up customers for products and services.

474
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
So go daddy.

475
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Which, by the way, if you're going to get a domain name, which eventually,

476
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
I think, almost everybody does.

477
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,720
And go daddy is all kinds of extra products like a quick blog.

478
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
You know, they've got free email.

479
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
There'll be associated with your domain names.

480
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,720
You could register Adams going to healthsynki.com.

481
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,720
And I could have a blog with it within seconds.

482
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
I could have a special email address for it.

483
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,720
And what the deal is is if you use my codes and actually on curry.com,

484
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
and I'll post a link in the for now.

485
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,720
And I really should post a link in the show notes as well.

486
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,720
If you use a checkout code DSC1, DSC2 or DSC3,

487
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,720
you can get all kinds of different fantastic deals at go daddy.

488
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Which you just can't get cheaper anywhere else,

489
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
but through the pod show network.

490
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,720
And the shows associated with the pod show network.

491
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,720
There are people making significant amounts of money with this,

492
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,720
which means of course that pod shows also making significant amounts of money.

493
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,720
And the way it works is we go out and we find fantastic products.

494
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,720
And we negotiate a bounty for each new customer.

495
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,720
We sign up or someone on our network signs up.

496
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,720
And we also negotiate a really good discount,

497
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
which of course you can't get anywhere else.

498
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,720
It's kind of like a QVC needs MTV if you will.

499
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
So those are the three ways we make money.

500
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,720
And then of course we steal it wherever we can.

501
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,720
So out of Jeff for Michigan.

502
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,720
Just wanted to say on a lighter note.

503
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,720
I was, I remembered what you said at the beginning,

504
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
actually the end of last year,

505
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,720
your kind of thought of the year or at least prediction for the year

506
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,720
that the music industry would be in a major meltdown by the end of it.

507
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,720
I think that's starting to occur.

508
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,720
My small little red film moment at that time.

509
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,720
This is recently I just read in a couple of blogs and some news articles

510
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,720
that radio had and Trent Resner of nine inch nails,

511
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,720
I believe, where the two that are going to give their music away for free.

512
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,720
And the whole thing being is that since the bands make their money,

513
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,720
they're going to get the music out there as they're advertising

514
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
and get people into the concerts.

515
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Which makes a lot of sense.

516
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,720
And that's the way a lot of people like to support their bands as being there.

517
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
So anyway, I thought I'd pass that along.

518
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,720
It's kind of break up some of the other red film moment.

519
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
I'm a little lighter.

520
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Hey, take it easy man.

521
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
All right, dude.

522
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Thank you so much.

523
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
And thank you for reminding me of that.

524
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Because we often forget to go back and look at our predictions.

525
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,720
And while you were talking there, I pulled it up.

526
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,720
This was posted on January 1st, 2007.

527
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
There's a lot here.

528
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
I'm not going to read it all.

529
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,720
But my predictions for 2007 in media entertainment.

530
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,720
The music sales industry will suffer a total meltdown.

531
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,720
As several established artists, without a current record deal,

532
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
will crack the online social media networks.

533
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Although sales will not be significant, mainstream media will build a case against

534
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
the big three labels, touting their demise.

535
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Shareholders will become nervous,

536
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
resulting in a stock tail spin and an exodus of management.

537
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
I think all of these things are pretty much happened.

538
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
The lawyers left running the joints won't be able to maintain sufficient levels of creativity

539
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
to keep business viable.

540
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
The artist responsible for the upheaval.

541
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Manage their online customer base to their own online presence.

542
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,720
Utilizing a myriad of APIs available to them for sales, messaging,

543
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,720
and media distribution through channels such as PMN and CD Baby.

544
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,720
There you go.

545
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Isn't that exactly what happened with the radio ahead?

546
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,720
The music publishing business will flourish as new players innovate on licensing terms

547
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
and become talent development agencies.

548
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
In some cases, this will be the indie record labels.

549
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
I think that's exactly what's happening.

550
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Madonna has now signed a new form of record deal where the label is essentially getting

551
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,720
a lot of money from her performances, her concerts.

552
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Let me see, then I say there will be a open source cross platform iTunes replacement

553
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,720
that will open the floodgates and new content.

554
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,720
I don't know if that's really happened.

555
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Mobile playing options drive time audiences will search for audio podcasts.

556
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,720
I think that's definitely happening.

557
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,720
As you go back and read it, but some of the things,

558
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,720
I guess it was pretty easy to predict these things.

559
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Maybe I'm not that smart and they feel it's just simple to predict.

560
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Hi Adam, this is Charles.

561
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Hey, Charles, the drunken Londoner.

562
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Oh, sober Londoner.

563
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
I'll just walk down our golf street.

564
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Yeah, you know, half as funny when you sober Charles.

565
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,720
Yeah, I was looking to yesterday, which is what I'm trying to make.

566
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Just approaching kind of a street.

567
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
There's just two, this wonderful city.

568
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,720
No, well, no, well, I'm talking about.

569
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Yeah, yeah.

570
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
All right.

571
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
All right, Charles, what's up?

572
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,720
So I was looking to yesterday, which is what's the day today?

573
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
It's the, what's that?

574
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
The eight.

575
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Uh, 683.

576
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
November.

577
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
So it was a seven.

578
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,720
You're talking about the dollar dropping.

579
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,720
I have to say, you know, rats and thinking ships seem so bit unfair,

580
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,720
but when people like to sell,

581
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,720
whose sister, let's call her Mrs. Bunchin.

582
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,720
Oh, you're talking about Gisela Bunchin, the supermodel.

583
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Um, brokers, her deals and it's a manager.

584
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,720
She, um, from what I read, has just, um, just, uh,

585
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,720
demanded payments or requested payments for her latest job.

586
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
One of our latest job in euros.

587
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Yeah.

588
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
You know, that's kind of telling.

589
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Isn't it?

590
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
It seems just shame.

591
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,720
It seems like, um, you have to, you ask those down.

592
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
They're going to take a lot of us with them.

593
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Well, you know, I think you're making a good point here.

594
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,720
Um, and honestly, uh, I'd be happy to get paid anything in euros right now.

595
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Uh, for the very same reason, it's, it's just much more stable.

596
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,720
So yeah, if it's happening on a micro level like that with Gisela Bunchin,

597
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,720
who, by the way, uh, I could think of any other ways to pay her for her services.

598
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Uh, you can now only imagine how other countries must be feeling.

599
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Yeah, I should, man.

600
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,720
You know, why don't we, um, why don't we consider getting paid in euros?

601
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Or trading that oil in euros?

602
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Yes, it truly is an issue.

603
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Hey, Adam, this is Matt Collin, you're from West Michigan, right along the beautiful

604
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
shoreline of Lake Michigan.

605
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,720
You know, it's one of those Americans that I add definitely not happy with the direction

606
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,720
that this country is going to, I think we've just totally lost track of where we should be,

607
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,720
you know, heading to and doing, you know, in the world, everything.

608
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,720
I kind of have this little theory that I think kicking around.

609
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,720
You know, when it comes down to it, really the United States, the actual government itself,

610
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,720
what we're, we're like 230 years old, kind of a thing.

611
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,720
We're still babies when you look at the rest of the government throughout the world,

612
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,720
especially, you know, like anywhere in Europe, Great Britain, France, Spain, whatever.

613
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Even the Middle East, we're even much younger than that.

614
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Yeah, I'll just stop you there for a second.

615
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Yes, and many would say that there's been no empire that has lasted more than 200 years.

616
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,720
So we're probably living on some borrowed time.

617
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Of course, all of these other empires have reinvented themselves.

618
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
So yeah, I'm following you there.

619
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,720
If a father of a pre-teen daughter or a pre-teen in general, you know,

620
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,720
she's looking older, she's starting to act older, but at the same time,

621
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,720
you know, she needs to be reminded once in a while that she's not.

622
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,720
And that's, I kind of see the fact that, you know,

623
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,720
to me, it looks like the United States of America is kind of having this,

624
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,720
we're getting bigger, we're getting stronger.

625
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,720
We think we know everything in fact is, we don't need to remind it once in a while that.

626
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
We don't know everything.

627
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,720
And so for those older established governments who have already gone through this,

628
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
and now maybe, I don't know, maybe they're in their 30s.

629
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Now if you want to look at that way, they've been there, they've done this.

630
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,720
And maybe that's what our problem is right now.

631
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,720
We just need to be reminded that, hey, we're one part of a larger world community.

632
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,720
And it's kind of maybe figure out what's going on with ourselves before we can do anything else.

633
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
I don't understand, making sense.

634
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Anyways, though.

635
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Yeah.

636
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,720
I'll see, scruncher, red pill, and, oh, yeah, fuck you out of the way.

637
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Yeah, thank you.

638
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Yeah, I have to agree.

639
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,720
You know, I have my own moronic teenage you hear at home as well.

640
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,720
And yeah, they, you know, absolutely.

641
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
It's adolescents, perhaps.

642
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
But we do have to kind of work on it.

643
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,720
And we got to work on it kind of quickly because you only have a short amount of time

644
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,720
when the teenage you start to act like an idiot that you've got to bring them back down to earth.

645
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,720
We'll be participating in that as much as I can.

646
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,720
Ah, one thing we can do while she Yankee doodles.

647
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Oh, wait a minute, this was done in Norway.

648
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Oh, it doesn't count, I guess.

649
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
We can mash up.

650
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
You'll love this one, check it out.

651
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
Oh, wait.

652
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,720
That's the way it should be.

653
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Say you, say me.

654
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,720
Say it together.

655
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,720
You need me.

656
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,720
But you know I'm in.

657
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,720
You need me.

658
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,720
You need me, say me.

659
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,720
You need me.

660
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
I have to agree.

661
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,720
I have to offer me.

662
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Oh, it doesn't count, I guess.

663
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,720
You need me.

664
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
You need me.

665
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
You need me.

666
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,720
You need me.

667
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
You need me.

668
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
You need me.

669
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
You need me.

670
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
You need me.

671
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
You need me.

672
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
You need me.

673
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
You need me.

674
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
You need me.

675
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
You need me.

676
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,720
That's the way it should be.

677
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Say you, say me.

678
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,720
Say it together.

679
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,720
You need me.

680
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,720
You need me.

681
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,720
You need me.

682
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,720
You need me.

683
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
You need me.

684
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
You need me.

685
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
You need me.

686
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
You need me.

687
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
You need me.

688
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
You need me.

689
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
You need me.

690
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
You need me.

691
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
You need me.

692
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
You need me.

693
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
You need me.

694
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
You need me.

695
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
You need me.

696
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
You need me.

697
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
You need me.

698
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
You need me.

699
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
You need me.

700
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
You need me.

701
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
You need me.

702
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
You need me.

703
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,720
How you want me?

704
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
워 lean in here.

705
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,720
That's the way it should be.

706
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:03,720
May I come before me to talk to you?

707
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,720
You can't pretend it's just an ugly thing

708
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,720
It doesn't matter what I say

709
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,720
I'm flowers I see, fresh

710
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,720
And make you feel like a pain

711
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,720
It's been a treat for best with friends

712
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,720
You didn't get all the tears

713
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,720
You saw me, I'll show you the world

714
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,720
I mean when you are right now

715
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,720
But I made it through your heart

716
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,720
I'll tell you a different story

717
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,720
We lost it, I'm open, don't you?

718
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,720
You see, tomorrow he will be me

719
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,720
Thank you

720
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Hey there, this is Rich Pab

721
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
And my 10 year old son

722
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Tony

723
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
Tony

724
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,720
And almost every day we bring you the Japanese podcast

725
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,720
And in this podcast we teach you how to say things that you will never ever use in Japanese

726
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Like for example, you should never say to your mother and law

727
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,720
And you should never use or stress

728
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Take that line

729
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,720
And you should never say this on the train

730
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:45,720
If you're interested in learning Japanese, you will never ever ever ever ever use

731
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,720
Come to the japplishpodcast at www.japplishpodcast.com

732
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Almost done

733
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Yes, same to you

734
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,720
You know he got his 10 year old kid to say fuck you Adam Curry and Japanese

735
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,720
That's a very cute show, by the way, I like it very much

736
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Hey speaking of foreign languages

737
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,720
Here's a savank we haven't heard from in a while in the Charlie

738
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,720
Hey Adam, this is, I don't know

739
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,720
The lazy friends fuck out, yes

740
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,720
And I'm calling you

741
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,720
You know, nice, nicely done with Ron Paul

742
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,720
Even though, you know, libertarians are not exactly my cup of tea

743
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,720
But at least the guy sticks to his convictions

744
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,720
So, you know, good for him

745
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,720
And I like the fact that he's the only Republican who has been very clear about

746
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:43,720
You know, condemning waterboarding and qualifying it as torture

747
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,720
And by the way, did we actually confirm an attorney general who did not condemn waterboarding

748
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
As torture?

749
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Is that actually, did that actually happen while I wasn't looking?

750
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,720
That's unbelievable

751
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,720
I asked for your little problem with the TSA

752
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
What were you thinking?

753
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
You know, you said over and over

754
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,720
During your, you know, in the DSC

755
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
You said over and over that you were going to

756
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Bring something along, just to prove that security doesn't work

757
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Well, that's what you played and you lost

758
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,720
No way, hold on a second, hold on a second

759
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,720
First of all, lots of misconceptions about this

760
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
I'm not on any no fly list, okay

761
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,720
The lazy French fucker has it, has it by the right end

762
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,720
I'm getting opened up upon arrival by custom

763
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
So that's a little bit different than most people are thinking

764
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Yeah, it's possible

765
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,720
So that would mean that the echelon project is working

766
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Either a, the echelon project works so well

767
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
They could decode the daily source code

768
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,720
And here those horrible comments I made

769
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Or it means that someone in the audience called them up

770
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,720
And told them to be on the lookout for what I'm bringing in

771
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Which I think is probably more likely

772
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
I mean, no sympathy there then

773
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,720
You, you, you know, you played around with them

774
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,720
And because you're wrong, it proves you that, you know

775
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,720
They can put some people on the watch list

776
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,720
And, you know, it works to some extent

777
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,720
No, I'm not, I'm no big fan of that, you say

778
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,720
I hate, you know, those stupid restrictions about liquids

779
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
And things like that, I think it's stupid

780
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,720
But, you know, you know, the one who said you were going to play with them

781
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,720
And, well, you know, they, they figured you were going to try something

782
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,720
So now you're blessed with it, hey, sorry dude

783
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,720
But you should have, if you don't get it on the download or something

784
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Anyway, um, well, I hope you see you around

785
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Then, uh, can just go sometimes soon

786
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
You take care, bye-bye

787
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
Yeah, I was actually getting something

788
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,720
Because you, you're called there, I know reminded me of something

789
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Uh, when I went to the airport at San Francisco

790
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,720
I had not seen this before and maybe I just missed it

791
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Or maybe it is brand new, I think it's new

792
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,720
There was a booth near the check-in counters

793
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
Uh, the international check-in counters

794
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,720
And, uh, right near the door

795
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,720
And it had this, like, eerie kind of blue neon high-tech glow

796
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,720
And there's this sign, this square sign that said clear

797
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,720
And, uh, the TSA, TSA guy who, it's the same guy by the way

798
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,720
Who checks your passport before you check-in

799
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
It's, it's crazy

800
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Uh, so they checks my passport before I check-in

801
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,720
You know, ask me the three important questions, you know, did you pack your bags yourself

802
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
You have anything sharp?

803
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,720
Um, and he said, hey, you should really check it out as a good deal

804
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Now listen to this, my friends

805
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Uh, I have the brochure here

806
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,720
Fly through airport security sign up today at flyclear.com

807

Avoid the hassle of airport security

808
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,720
I'm like, well, that's pretty interesting

809
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,720
What is it?

810
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
Well, first of all, why clear?

811
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,720
And just think of this name

812
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,720
Just think of how smart this name is

813
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Hey man, don't worry, you can go through security

814
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Because you're clear

815
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
Does that sound science fiction or what?

816
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Why clear fast?

817
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
Get through airport security faster with less hassle

818
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Don't worry about unpredictably long lines

819
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
It's convenient

820
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,720
Access a designated security line with special benefits

821
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Enjoy help from our attendance as you go through the clear lane

822
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,720
Use your clear card at all participating airports at no additional cost

823
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,720
It's secure

824
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Your identity is verified using your fingerprint and iris images

825
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,720
The department of Homeland Security will administer continuous security review of members

826
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,720
This is it, this is the national ID card

827
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
This is how they're going to track your ass into oblivion

828
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
So just imagine, right?

829
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,720
So I'm looking at this in this belief

830
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,720
But they've created a product called clear

831
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,720
So essentially, you know, now they can track your ass anywhere

832
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,720
And all it is is you just get a different security line

833
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
You still have to go through the metal detector

834
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,720
You still have to go through x-ray stuff

835
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,720
But I love this line, I just really loved it

836
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,720
The department of Homeland Security will administer continuous security reviews of all members

837
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,720
So this is like please, would you please like track my ass everywhere I go

838
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,720
Again to you, this will become mandatory within the next three to five years

839
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,720
If we don't get a guy like Ron Paul in the White House

840
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
We're fucked, my friends

841
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,720
$99.95 for the first year, what a bargain to be tracked by the American government

842
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,720
And upon arrival in the UK, oh yes, iris, the faster way to clear immigration

843
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,720
It's the exact same thing

844
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,720
So every country now wants you to have an ID card with a little chip on it

845
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,720
That's so that they can track you

846
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,720
I don't think so, I really don't think so

847
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,720
And if you think that that's cool and it's no hassle, think again

848
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Do not, I repeat, do not sign up for any fingerprint or iris scanner

849
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Any recognition systems, it is the beginning of the end

850
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,720
I'd love for the Buckeye Drive Time podcast and the tone ranger

851
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
Fuck you

852
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,720
Fuck you, I don't care

853
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:13,720
Fuck you

854
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,720
Fuck you

855
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Fuck you

856
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,720
Fuck you

857
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Fuck you

858
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,720
Fuck you

859
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Fuck you

860
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,720
Fuck you

861
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
Fuck you

862
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,720
Fuck you

863
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,120
There's a word into the Blackwater type of companies.

864
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,640
And you're right, I didn't even bother to realize

865
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,400
or think about the fact that there are thousands

866
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,120
of these companies out there.

867
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,160
But one very important factor that I think a lot of people

868
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,160
probably don't realize about these private companies.

869
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,800
As you know, currently the US publicly states,

870
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,560
the number of US soldiers killed,

871
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,080
and has that number come down.

872
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,800
It looks good for Bush, blah, blah, blah.

873
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,240
But what a lot of people don't realize

874
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,640
that these private security and these private firms

875
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,120
when they incur guests, because they are a private company.

876
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,160
They are not reported.

877
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,760
So for every US soldier that is no longer killed

878
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,600
in the war overseas, they have a private firm

879
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,320
is loses a person.

880
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,160
Not counted.

881
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,040
So on behalf of the US,

882
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,760
the US people never actually really know about it,

883
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,600
which I think is something that is very,

884
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,760
very important that they still look

885
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,880
and be loved into.

886
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,360
Cheers, give a good shot.

887
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,240
Good work, man.

888
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,080
Thank you.

889
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,680
And actually, that brings up another thing I just want.

890
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,120
And this is something, I guess, on Friday,

891
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,800
John C. Duvorak and I will bring up again.

892
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,840
On no agenda, there was this story that was sent to me

893
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,480
about a Dutch couple.

894
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,440
Between 25 or 30 years old, who were caught caught,

895
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,480
I would say, it's not illegal.

896
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,920
Hitchhiking in Texas on the way to Mexico

897
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,600
is they were backpacking throughout the US.

898
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,440
They wanted to go all the way down to South America

899
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,840
and then over to Australia.

900
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,360
And they were picked up by Border Patrol

901
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,040
and thrown in jail for six weeks

902
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,360
without an opportunity to speak to an attorney,

903
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,520
without an opportunity to phone home to the Netherlands.

904
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,600
I had no one to call in the US.

905
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Now this story, I think it's kind of popped

906
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,760
to the top of the stack again in Holland

907
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,680
because this couple are now saying they're going to sue

908
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,240
the United States, which is probably why they got

909
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,480
some attention, but it all happened at the end of 2006.

910
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,840
And it appeared on a television show in Holland,

911
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,240
in February of 2007, I think.

912
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,880
The program is called Nova.

913
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,320
And this television program pretends

914
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,320
to be a very journalistic, a deep journalistic program,

915
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,320
which is bullshit because I've been on the program

916
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,280
and they don't do any work at all,

917
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,400
as far as I can tell, any journalistic work.

918
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,800
And so I took a look at this and I'm like,

919
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,000
oh, this is pretty interesting story,

920
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,640
so I really wanted to get the first hand information.

921
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,640
And at one point, the woman of this couple says,

922
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,440
after a month, after four weeks in jail

923
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,640
in this jail in Texas, they were allowed to finally write

924
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,760
a letter, so they were writing letters to each other

925
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,840
in the same jail, of course, she was in the women's ward

926
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,080
and he was in the men's ward.

927
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,040
And I freeze framed the video because they showed an envelope

928
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,680
and from that I got the jail in,

929
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,560
it was at, oh boy, hold on a second.

930
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,480
Now I got to go and find it.

931
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,320
I didn't write this down, anyway.

932
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,640
So I discovered the name of the jail

933
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,760
and I googled it and it was very hard to find anything.

934
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,760
In fact, it's homepage had been removed,

935
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,400
which I found interesting.

936
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,680
It was not just the 404, but a server not found,

937
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,000
so it was completely gone.

938
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,760
It turns out it's a commercial jail

939
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,440
and it's run by an outfit called management,

940
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,240
the management training company.

941
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,720
Interestingly enough, a former executive

942
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,520
of the managing the management training company

943
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,200
was the consultant to the cleanup of jails in Iraq,

944
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,560
in particular the Abu Graib Hotel.

945
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,360
Ha ha ha ha, prison.

946
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,520
Does that mean anything to you?

947
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,960
And when you read, and I'm not gonna post any links about this,

948
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,320
I wanna keep this discussion kind of on the Noah gender,

949
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,560
so we'll do that on Friday,

950
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,840
but I think we really should go deep into this investigation,

951
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,800
because clearly it's one of these commercial jails,

952
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,160
which are incentivized, as they say,

953
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,280
to keep people out, but of course they're not,

954
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,960
because every person they get into jail,

955
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,160
they get paid for and there's money rolling around

956
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,680
and clearly they're shit and they're horrible

957
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,520
and unconstitutional behavior going on on these jails.

958
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,480
Just it blew me away in two regards, one,

959
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,400
how easy it was to track this down

960
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,720
and these journalists of serious newspapers,

961
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,920
the Al-Hameen Dochblot in Holland and of Nova,

962
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,080
had not even gone that far to even Google the name of the jail,

963
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,360
they could have found out so much

964
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,720
that there's a real story here, a real story.

965
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,280
Hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts

966
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,400
have been a war probably no bid contracts

967
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,800
have been awarded to this company.

968
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,640
And it's, the shit just keeps on getting deeper, my friends.

969
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,440
Oh, wait a minute, I gotta pop a red pill haul.

970
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,320
Okay, yeah, I feel much better.

971
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,320
Hey, it's already 45 minutes.

972
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,640
I wanna play one more song for you

973
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,360
and this voice mail attached to it.

974
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,360
Hey Adam, this is Laura Adams.

975
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,960
I have to show, called the MBA Working Girl Podcast,

976
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,240
and I just wanted to share some random thoughts with you.

977
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,760
Number one, I love using the PMN for my show.

978
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,600
I just found a funny, funky song

979
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,720
that you might wanna play called Super Hot Lady Cup.

980
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,560
Also, thanks for recommending the Constitution classes.

981
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,040
I watched all of them and am now studying

982
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,280
more about the Constitution on my own.

983
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,200
If you haven't seen a video called The Money Master's,

984
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,320
how international bankers being control of America,

985
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,240
a highly, highly recommended.

986
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,000
It's about three hours and 35 minutes,

987
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,320
but it's just jam-packed with excellent information.

988
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,920
And you're really responsible for opening my mind

989
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,360
that to Ron Paul.

990
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,160
He is now my name.

991
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,640
So thanks so much for what you do to that the great work, bye-bye.

992
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,800
Yeah, all right, right on.

993
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,600
Well, first of all, let me just check the latest Tally.

994
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,400
Ron Paul, now over $8 million,

995
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,720
we have just under two months to get the remaining 4 million

996
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,880
for the 12 million quota that we're looking for.

997
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,800
It's necessary in order to have enough money

998
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,280
to advertise before the primaries,

999
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,720
which have actually been moved up

1000
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,840
with some mysterious reason.

1001
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,400
So yeah, I'm still definitely right behind Ron Paul.

1002
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,240
If we get this guy elected, boy, would that change our lives?

1003
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,040
It certainly would be a way to bring this

1004
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,600
moronic teenager of a country that we have back in the line.

1005
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,400
It's completely necessary.

1006
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,960
So far, I see no other candidate who has even

1007
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,800
a semblance of the right idea.

1008
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,480
Second point to your comment there.

1009
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,600
Yeah, I know, Bohall, I have played this song in the past

1010
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,160
probably two years ago when we were still at the cottage.

1011
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,120
Happy to play it again, super hot lady cup.

1012
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:25,960
It is Bohall.

1013
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,960
Super hot lady cup.

1014
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,600
I want to go to the coma, but I ain't got the time.

1015
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:05,160
But this lady cup is driving me, driving me out of my mind.

1016
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,640
Won't you stop writing that ticket?

1017
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,240
Walt is 100.

1018
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,320
He helped you change your mind.

1019
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,680
What to do with them now?

1020
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,360
Hands cut, you're pretty like that,

1021
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,320
I felt that you and me could reach a top of five.

1022
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,520
Super hot lady cup.

1023
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,880
You're so kind, lady cup.

1024
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,920
Super hot lady cup.

1025
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,920
You can't speak ever in time.

1026
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:53,920
So you got my license, and I read your phrase, sure

1027
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,920
So you got me going close to 69

1028
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,920
That might be illegal and for to sell a saint

1029
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,920
But I can't help myself, not my y'all, don't buy high

1030
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:13,920
Super hot lady cop, mama y'all, don't buy high lady cop

1031
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:21,920
Wow super hot lady cop, you can't smell your tie

1032
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,120
So I'm baby cocked

1033
00:49:43,920 --> 00:50:08,920
She had a nice set of guns, 38 to least, and as we talked, I got into trouble when I tried to steal my piece.

1034
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,920
See how I was sticking to myself if I played my card right.

1035
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,920
I hope it gets wrong by the end of the night.

1036
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:44,920
I worked my way out of this situation, and now I'm thinking I should have paid the fine.

1037
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:53,920
As a step to the van, I heard a teller partner, if the party wagons rocking, don't come and knock it out.

1038
00:50:53,920 --> 00:51:08,920
I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot.

1039
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:18,920
I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot.

1040
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:33,920
I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot.

1041
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:43,920
I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot.

1042
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:19,920
I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot.

1043
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:32,920
I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot.

1044
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:50,920
I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself.

1045
00:52:50,920 --> 00:53:05,920
I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself.

1046
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:35,920
I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and I can't help myself, maybe I'm super hot, and

1047
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:42,720
except through the pod show network, and I was just thinking, it was kind of travelling back in time over the past

1048
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,040
15 minutes or so, thinking about the show, and I say I was so weird, so surreal to be walking

1049
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:55,460
through San Francisco International Airport, hearing on the пад system, if you've been an

1050
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,280
SFO or any other airport you've heard this.

1051
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,220
The current Homeland Security Alert is at state orange, and I was thinking, all we're missing

1052
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:06,660
there is the current homeland security alert is at orange.

1053
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,380
Avoid the hassles of homeland security with your new clear card.

1054
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:15,140
I mean, is that something straight from an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie or what?

1055
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,900
Be careful. Be careful. Don't sign up for that shit.

1056
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,620
All right, Adam at podshow.com. DailySourceco.com is where you can find all the

1057
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,260
show notes or everything discussed and played on the show.

1058
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,980
And I'll be back tomorrow. I hope you'll join me. Take care, bye.

1059
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,420
Another podshow podcast. Stick it in your ear.

1060
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,300
Yo, what's up? Is your man Tony Costa from Cossus World?

1061
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,820
Telling you to go check out the new Sony Pictures release.

1062
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,380
This Christmas is Star's Chris Brown.

1063
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,220
But Kai Fife for Regina King. Lauren Lundin. Columbus Short.

1064
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:54,900
And it... It just has an all-star cast.

1065
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,500
Yeah, I mean, you can exchange gifts.

1066
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,220
You can exchange the socks. You can exchange fruit cake.

1067
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,460
But you cannot exchange family.

1068
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,260
So make sure you check out this Christmas when it hits theaters.

1069
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,380
November 21st, 2007. And I'm out.
