1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Oh yeah, Adam, I noticed that you're getting into the D.A.C. 4-5-7.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Double 5-7.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,020
Too shale, chap, mayce me think back to the time when Miss Moneypenny, or yes, would be actress

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,220
who plead Miss Moneypenny.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,500
She and I got together had a little trist and I showed her what the double owes really

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
are.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,940
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, and the next generation radio

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,220
content in my ears.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,660
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,580
In a world where TV networks, movie studios, and record labels still think they can

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,660
govern what you see in here.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,180
One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses and make big media

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,100
corporations wet their tiny little pants.

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,940
From Pod Show, home of the world's most dangerous new content comes the Daily Source Code with

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,740
Adam Curry.

16
00:01:51,180 --> 00:02:03,180
I've never sleep anymore, and I can't be with you anymore, and I can see in the darkness

17
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:11,620
since you left me in the dark, I replicines from our direction, along the screens

18
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:30,300
I've never been the same again, not since I had the operation, the searches were down

19
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:55,660
behind, but the left me with a plane, yeah, but they left me with a plane, so I watch movies

20
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:06,700
in the darkness, in my garage speak, and above it all is sub-titled, there are so tiny

21
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:17,420
dreams, but I don't speak Chinese, so I'll just never understand why you don't have

22
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:25,620
me anymore, and why your boyfriend wants to kill me, and why watching this film,

23
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:45,300
and for the night, so I can't be a living, so I can't have a place to see, or not depending,

24
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:54,500
I'll always plan at the multiplex, and what is plan at the movies, I need to try and eat a

25
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:19,620
strange book, freak accident, Chinese phrase book, taken off daily source code episode 557,

26
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:27,460
hey everybody, how are you doing coming to you from the affluent suburb, sorry, I'm sorry,

27
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,820
it's the curry manner on the west side of G-town, how are you doing? It's been one of those days

28
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,980
already for me, yesterday I had that whole BT thing I did in the morning, today at 930 I knew

29
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:45,780
I had an appointment with my dental hygienist and dropped Christina off at school and then continued

30
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,060
on to the dentist, but the road was diverted, broken up, so I arrived like 20 minutes late,

31
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:58,740
and they said, no, you know, I have another customer 10, I called you that I was late, why didn't

32
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,220
you say come back later, and she said, well it turns out we can take you to a clock, so

33
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,780
kind of got to hurry to show along today to make that appointment, and then of course I came back

34
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:15,780
to the manner, I walk in, I open the door, and the minute I hit the, the, the mat inside where you

35
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,260
where you wipe your feet, which is right inside the door, I know exactly what has happened,

36
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,740
how the little Yorkie took a dump, and I walk right in and step right in it, and man, it was one of

37
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,260
those, like those, you know, dark crap doesn't always have to smell, but when you step in it,

38
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:39,700
right, and then my finger started bleeding again, the one that I cut open on the, on the

39
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,420
nav kit, for the N800, I got lots of fun stuff to talk about when it comes to the N800 today,

40
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:54,020
but first the seems to be all kinds of trouble in mainstream radio land and and also with the

41
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,820
streaming media, I don't know if you've been following all these stories, I see Scott Penton sent

42
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:08,500
me story about first the payoff over all the fines that were paid over Payola accusations.

43
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,260
The company's accused were clear channel communications, CBS radio, enter-com communications,

44
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:22,820
and Citadel broadcasting, combined the paid a total of $12.5 million in fees for taking money in

45
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,940
exchange for playing certain records, or songs that actually says, a practice poppin on his

46
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:35,300
payola, which of course, you know, in a free open world, I guess, isn't a problem, but when you're

47
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,740
using very limited resources that are licensed by the government, you can't play favorites like that.

48
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,420
And let me see some interesting things in this story, not so much about, you know, well,

49
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,780
first of all, what did the guy from Clear Channel say? He is pretty funny here. It is Andrew,

50
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,860
W. Levin, Clear Channel's executive vice president and chief legal officer said,

51
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,580
well, no violations were found. We are pleased to announce that Clear Channel has agreed to

52
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,780
settle this long-standing payola investigation with the FCC. We believe it is time to close the door

53
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,940
on this ongoing inquiry and move forward. No violations were found, then I don't understand why

54
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:17,300
you paid the fine. The way this works, by the way, is through independent record promoters.

55
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:24,500
It's not like some record executive comes into the studio and slips the guy some bills,

56
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,740
and he starts playing the song as much more sophisticated than that. Independent record promoters,

57
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,460
and I know several of them, and a really nice guy's, but they are totally sitting at the

58
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:40,100
asshole of the industry of mainstream RIA and broadcasting. That's where the real money flows.

59
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,380
And I think I've mentioned before how it works, but they will essentially pay an independent

60
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:51,700
record promoter money. And it could be millions and millions, and it's often based on number of

61
00:07:51,700 --> 00:08:00,020
plays, number of spins that a song gets on radio stations, that independent record promoter

62
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,380
basically represents. He doesn't really represent them in that case, and he doesn't really represent

63
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:16,020
the record company, but he can do things like say, hey, you know, I'm promoting Kaiser Chiefs.

64
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,620
I'm just pulling something out of my ass, doesn't matter who. I'm promoting the Kaiser Chiefs.

65
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:26,180
I'll tell you what. I'm going to give you 100 tickets to their concert when they come through town,

66
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,660
and I'm going to give you a promotional budget of $40,000. He's a real figures, by the way.

67
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:37,140
I'll give you $40,000 and 100 tickets, and now you're not allowed to spend that on anything,

68
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,460
but promotional activities. There's a little catch, which of course is, you know,

69
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,900
one of the monies in, right? And it gets paid to the station. It's not paid to disjockeys or to

70
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,260
program directors. Of course, there's all kinds of, you know, business-related dinners and lunches,

71
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:59,860
but that's normal in any business, I guess. And so, and of course, it's not written down,

72
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,580
but that is an exchange for an X number of plays. And those plays are determined by rotation.

73
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,060
So if something gets put into medium rotation or hot rotation, you know how many times it's

74
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,980
going to get played, because that's all automated. So that's essentially what this is about.

75
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:18,820
But here's something that I found very, very interesting. Where is it?

76
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,300
It was a very, it was about independent labels.

77
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:34,100
Let me see, here we go. So this is Eliot Spitzer, who brought this wrath upon

78
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,620
his radio companies. Mr. Spitzer's inquiry disclosed how such payment payments have become widespread

79
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,780
as label executives pressed to obtain exposure for stars. In some cases, label executives offered

80
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,860
pay off directly. Oh, okay, I stand corrected. In others, they hired middlemen known as independent

81
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:54,020
record promoters to funnel gifts or other enticements to radio station personnel. It's much more

82
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,860
sophisticated than that. I'd love to see the original court documents. I don't know if you can

83
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,660
get them anywhere. I'm sure under the Freedom Information Act somewhere. Here's, here's this

84
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,820
extra deal. So this settlement with the FCC, this article states, it's from the New York Times.

85
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:13,540
Comes at a time as a separate arrangement in which broadcasters agreed to devote more time to

86
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,900
playing artists who are not signed to contracts with the four big record companies. I caught my eye

87
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:26,020
because that basically could mean everybody. I think. But it appears that this deal, I'm reading again

88
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,980
negotiated by the American Association of Independent Music provides that the radio companies will

89
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,460
broadcast the equivalent of 8,400, so 8,400, half-hour segments of music from such artists.

90
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,540
I guess who are members of the American Association of Independent Music.

91
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,900
The segments can run anytime from 6 a.m. to midnight any day of the week,

92
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,100
according to the people briefed on the deal. Wow, this is very interesting.

93
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,220
And how do you get into into one of those 8,400, half-hour segments?

94
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,820
And that seems pretty exclusionary by itself. Could we set up a pod safe music

95
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:14,100
a pod safe music association, PMA, and negotiate such a deal? Why did they agree to that?

96
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,100
That's very interesting. I'm sure this is the independent record label, so I'm sure that

97
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,620
they're struggling to get anything they can, but it seems not like we have the really

98
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,660
the four big ones, then we have thousands of smaller ones who are basically a fifth big one.

99
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,260
8,400, half-hour segments. I wonder if that's from all radio stations?

100
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,020
And is that over what time is that? Is that over one hour, one day, 24-hour period? So is it

101
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,140
8,000 stations all have to do one half-hour segment? Does anyone have any more information on that?

102
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:51,780
That's pretty interesting. A lot of things changing there.

103
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,820
And the other thing was, I don't have an article to point to,

104
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,020
a docksurls actually, a dock.weblogs.com, I think.

105
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:10,580
He posted about the new rates for streaming, so you can stream licensed music legally if you want to.

106
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:18,020
And apparently the sound exchange has now posted new rates, which pretty much put the small guys out of

107
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:28,660
business. And I say, you know, start streaming pod safe music. This is crazy. I've got to tell

108
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,620
you, I'm afraid again to play anything from my first gen iPod when I look at all this and like,

109
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,460
now these guys are pretty fucking serious. They're really, really, really grassy. We had anything

110
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:45,860
they can, and it's a bit frightening, I have to say. And by the way, that $12.5 million, I'm just going

111
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:52,740
back to the FCC Payola case. Where does that money go? Does that go to artists who got

112
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,940
jipped, who didn't get played because stuff that was for pay for play was put into rotation?

113
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,940
Where does the $12.5 million go? Does it just go to the city? Does it go to Elliott Spitzer?

114
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,580
Inquiring minds need to know. Fantastic news. Nokia. I am such a fan of this

115
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:16,020
N800 tablet. I really am. It's not a cell phone. It's the web tablet that I've been using.

116
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,660
I'm just waiting about because I love it so much. I was doing email. I don't have to walk around

117
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:27,220
a laptop. No, can't. Everybody say it. Nokia. Nokia could turn on thousands of podcasters,

118
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:34,660
but I really like the open source nature. I'm SSHM from my laptop. And then I have the NC running.

119
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,180
Next to it, you should see this development environment. That's what the N800 is fantastic for.

120
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:47,060
It's available now. Love it. By the way, this is not paid endorsement. No money has

121
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:56,020
exchange hands with Nokia. All right. Sunder from podcast studio, Donna Nell. I thought the

122
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,180
vocals were a little low and that makes their sunder. I liked it though. Yesterday I tried it out.

123
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,980
I tried Void for the first time at the entire day to see how it would work and this gizmo project

124
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,420
is awesome. Now, of course, the reason why it's awesome is because I'm using it on a device that

125
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,540
is portable throughout my entire home. I can walk wherever I want, continue the conversation.

126
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,500
I mean, that's talking about the Nokia N800 web tablet. And I plugged in the headphones that come

127
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,220
with it. It comes with headphones with a microphone built in. So I love doing phone calls in stereo,

128
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,540
or at least with two earphones in. So nice. Because then you're really in the conversation.

129
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,380
It's much easier to concentrate. And so there's a mic built in. Everyone said that they could

130
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,780
hear me find. It was a very minimal delay. It seemed like an ongoing conversation.

131
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,220
The only thing I couldn't get to work at all yet. And I've looked around and I've googled it

132
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,540
and it seems that not everyone's having the same problem where they have had the problem and it went away

133
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,900
is a DTMF tones. So when I'm calling into a conference line and I want to, you know, I need to

134
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:58,980
control the computer on the other end with the touch tone keypad. It has a keypad. This gizmo

135
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,020
project software. And I hit it, but it, you know, it doesn't respond on the other end. So maybe it's

136
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,700
just a one-off that I didn't work. I like it. I really do. And people are calling me on it. Now

137
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:15,060
there's still some, some crap going on with it. You know, and I hate this every single time

138
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,340
this, you know, you work with new technologies and particularly when it comes to stuff that we're

139
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:28,180
so used to. Color ID is way, way, way important. And it just doesn't seem to work very well through

140
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:35,940
many of these voice applications. It shows up as asterix caller at sippphone proxy01.cippphone.co

141
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,820
whatever it is. It's not handy. Give me the, please, show me the number. So I know who's calling me.

142
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,140
I got a lot of comments about about voice over IP. As I, as I had expected and

143
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,740
this asterix thing, I've been reading about that for a long, long time for years it seems.

144
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:02,580
It looks like it's like a very robust platform now for a building open source based PBX's or phone

145
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:11,220
switches. Hi Adam, TJ for a user. I was just listening to the DSC on my every other day

146
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:18,020
commute back from Brussels. And you were talking about two things. One, getting a folks'

147
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:26,020
discussion, maybe for your offices. Plus, just want to say, have a look at a asterisk,

148
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:35,060
which is definitely a great open source PBX, which is not already your average open source project

149
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:40,900
that this cable is only in complete call centers. Yeah, he goes on for another minute in 24.

150
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:47,460
I'll save you. But yeah, I checked out the the Asterix project. That's awesome.

151
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,900
I'm going to see if I can, if I can get Brian to look at this, Brian is the operations

152
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:02,740
of pod show before he goes and buy some really expensive voice systems. So typical the way that goes.

153
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,780
But I think it'll work. Particularly for these phone conferences, it's fantastic. I call the

154
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:12,260
whole day yesterday. I think they used like 17 cents. I was on the, I was on for hours.

155
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:19,380
Yeah, so totally digging it. By the way, I have two accounts on the Gizmo project and the one

156
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,940
that's searchable. I don't have the password for it. I'm not quite sure how that happened. Maybe

157
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,500
someone else registered it. But it's not me. I'm not listed in the white pages. I don't want this

158
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,980
number to be known. If you don't mind. That comic strip blogger posted a comment about the

159
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:41,620
N800 yesterday in the comment section on the show site daily source code.com. As I'm looking

160
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:48,500
for a name, you know, we have Trinity, the lovely, the lovely beauty that is my baby poo colored

161
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:54,660
1984 Mercedes station wagon running on biodiesel that is going across the country as we get the

162
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:01,300
N800 system ready to feed back information. So of course, this box is about to open reports.

163
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,740
White open. So a select few developers can come in, violator file system. And of course,

164
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,420
if it's a sheet, and Trinity has a name, she has a name as well. I thought Angelina would be nice

165
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:16,260
because those are highly desired ports. Comic strip blogger yesterday with another suggestion.

166
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,900
He says, yes, Angelina Jolie is sexy because she's a mixture of two races, native

167
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:27,140
American and European, but you would be more proper to call the N800 Tariah. That's Tango

168
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,940
Alpha Romeo Juliet Alpha Tariah. It is a popular Finnish name and also first name of current

169
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:40,740
Finnish female president. Fins would love you for this. Tariah. And it's probably like

170
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:51,380
Fuck you in Finnish, and only comics would block it. Comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip,

171
00:18:54,260 --> 00:19:02,740
comic strip, the daily source code with crap. That wasn't it. Oh shit. How did I do that wrong?

172
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:10,900
Oh man, it was so perfectly perfectly set up. All I wear is a comic strip blogger sent in this whole

173
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:21,940
thing. All right, I found it. Here we go. Where come? To help the city of Charlie,

174
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:36,180
557, a podcast of Adam Kerry who is a young boy compared to me an old prick who can't get it up.

175
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:46,580
Neither with Viagra nor with Levitra, but wrong cop off for just coffee with splendor.

176
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:54,580
Let me stay worthy. It's back. Oh boy. Yeah. I have no idea what he's talking about.

177
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,100
But thank you. Now I don't have to mention Splendent Folgers. You did it for me. Here's

178
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,900
a thing I played before the kind of misfire. The daily source code with Adam Kerry. It's my art

179
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,420
being able to choose the music that I want to play for you is virtually Nirvana. It's musical for my

180
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,700
work. I love the cowbell on it. Oh, it's sweaty. I really want to lift that leg and squeeze the

181
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,420
butt. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. It's geeky goodness. I mean, just start this thing up on a

182
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,260
command line and then lock that puppy down. You know, that's about all this need. It's low.

183
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:30,500
You're supposed to be my trophy wife and I can just see it now. And it's all for you. It's my job

184
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,820
to entertain you. If that means going to jail, so be it. I love Brian. No, just started working

185
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,380
at Pod Show at the beginning of the month. Welcome, Brian. He does that at the Frank Truth podcast.

186
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,020
It was a cool man. We're doing a whole mess of them for and we're going to do them in video.

187
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:52,820
I think for our, like, top 80 shows or something. It's a tremendous task. I have no idea.

188
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,060
We're going to pull it off. But this was kind of a test to see if this is, this is, you know,

189
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,460
kind of the direction we want to go. I love it. I love the way that sounds. I don't know, Jim.

190
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,820
Jim. You've seen fused. I've just got an invite this morning and I've just installed it.

191
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,380
Me, this is this is each of this. This is definitely the future of television.

192
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,220
Oh, I haven't gotten the invite to the minute, but if you don't already have one, give us a

193
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:25,860
certain, if I do get one, I'll certainly send you a link about you. This is fantastic. Hey,

194
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:33,940
so hearing James's enthusiasm, I have received a couple of invites to juice. That's the Skype

195
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,900
guys or it's a company, the Skype guys invested in. I don't think they're running the company.

196
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,900
And actually it's a Dutch name, which you would pronounce Yost. But okay, everyone's saying

197
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,700
juice fine, which makes it sound so much more like juice, the aggregator. But anyway,

198
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,300
so I think they're, their beta must have opened up a little bit wider because now I'm receiving

199
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,460
invites left and right. And I got to say, fire this thing up. It's like, wow, you're blown away

200
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:05,220
by the quality. They really, really did that right. And I'm looking at it. I'm like, I had the same

201
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:11,620
reaction James had. It's like, yeah, this is television. This is fucking awesome. And that, of

202
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,180
course, is the great thing at the same time, it's kind of the bad thing. Because it feels very

203
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,140
much like television and navigation. You know, it's like a cable system, so you have channels.

204
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,460
And actually more like programs, I would say. So you have, you know, the discovery network

205
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,180
has a channel and they have one show in there. I presume they're going to have more shows

206
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:35,220
per individual channel. It's going to be a lot of mainstream content in there. So I think for

207
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,980
for saying it's a, it's a different way of watching television. Absolutely.

208
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:49,620
Is it YouTube now? Is it, by the way, I would not mind having a, a pod show channel in there.

209
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,780
Definitely see if we can get that we can weasel our way and wouldn't be much different from

210
00:22:53,780 --> 00:23:00,180
producing for serious satellite radio, I guess. Because, you know, it's, I'm not, I'm not sure if they

211
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:05,860
have like a subscription type service. The one thing I do know is, and I'm not quite sure how they,

212
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,700
how they add up the numbers. I know actually, yeah, they have it right here. When you use this

213
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,860
per hour, you will be downloading the equivalent of 350 megabytes and uploading the equivalent

214
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:25,460
of 150 megabytes of data. So that's half a gigabyte per hour of, of watching. Now, of course,

215
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:31,220
you're probably going to watch it for an hour, half an hour. It seems like that's going to be a

216
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,420
problem. If, if that amount of, if forget about, you know, people who are on set payment plans and

217
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,940
and stuff like that who could run into some significant issues. I got juiced by juiced

218
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,980
when that suck if someone didn't know that they had a cap on their bandwidth and they're playing

219
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,740
with this thing and then, you know, they get some astronomical bill. I guarantee you that's going to

220
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,980
happen. You know, someone is going to get fucked by that. But that can happen with anything. That

221
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,700
can happen if you leave a bit torrent open or lime wire or anything. You could get severely screwed

222
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,020
on you. I used to have that all the time in Belgium. Oh, it's suck. Because you couldn't even get

223
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,140
unmeted bandwidth there. But this half a gig thing, I think is going to be tough on just networks

224
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:15,940
in general. And I wonder, I think that it's highly possible. Now, these guys are kind of smart because

225
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:21,220
they're taking a, they're taking a stance and they're saying we're really going to go after,

226
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,780
you know, big television shows and mainstream content. And yes, we'll have some, what they call

227
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:33,220
user generated stuff. Crap, serious people. Stay tuned. More coming up. Yeah. So they say that they'll

228
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,340
have a channel for user generated content. So I pretty much seems like it's going, they're following

229
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:44,020
the iTunes model. And their business model from what I've understood is based on advertising. I haven't

230
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,100
seen any ads pop up yet. So I don't know if they've enabled that yet or how they integrate

231
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:55,780
them. They seem to have a lot of cool overlay technology. So when you're, you know, watching a show,

232
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,460
I presume something could slide in over the top. It wouldn't necessarily have to interrupt.

233
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,020
You know, that could be interesting to see what they come up with there. But this, this bandwidth

234
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,780
thing, I think it could spark off the first example. We'll see of a net neutrality debate in the

235
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:16,420
real world, because, you know, think about it for a second. That type of traffic. It's just a lot.

236
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,460
I'd ask any network engineer. If a lot of people are using this, I don't care how distributed

237
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:28,580
it is sucking down 350 megabytes. And well, it basically transferring half a gig per hour.

238
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,980
If that happens a lot in your network, it's going to start to suck. And maybe some of their

239
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:38,580
topology is set up. So, you know, it does work better within networks. But, I mean, my DSL, here's

240
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,980
pissed poor as is. Imagine if, you know, because, of course, I'm sharing it somewhere.

241
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,980
It's some head ever ratio. I forget what it is. So, of course, I'm sharing that somewhere else.

242
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:54,420
It's some head-end connection thing. Some switch point. And, you know, so, if a couple people

243
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:01,780
are watching juice through all these different, you know, local network points, it could, I think

244
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,620
it could bring down the network. I'd love to hear from engineers who know about this stuff.

245
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,140
I know a little bit about it. That's why I'm concerned. But, I couldn't really tell you if that

246
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,380
is a big deal of prepared for it. But, it seems like a lot. It seems certainly like a hell of a lot

247
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,260
more bandwidth than your YouTube usage, if you know what I mean. I mean, that's, of course,

248
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:25,460
that's why they get this beautiful quality. So, I think the, the telcos, the telephone providers,

249
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,300
basically, who are running a lot of this, well, even the cable guys, a lot of the same problem.

250
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,540
The cable guys know how to distribute video very efficiently. And this has, I just don't think

251
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:40,900
a very efficient way of distributing video. At least not with current capacity. So, I think that

252
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,460
they're going to say, hey, you know, juice guys, fuck you. We're switching you off the network.

253
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:51,220
And they're probably more likely to do that because the television networks and production

254
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,580
companies who are contributing. Now, again, I'd love to contribute to it too, because I think

255
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:59,620
the experience is fantastic. You know, they're licensing their content to juice. You know,

256
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,500
I think that they are, in effect, in direct competition with a lot of the services that the telco

257
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:10,740
providers, you know, think of IPTV, you know, the British telecom wants to provide their own television

258
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,140
on their network. In their own distributed way and their, in their way, you know, it's their

259
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,820
network. They know what the hell they're doing. I'm sure Virgin Media wants to do the same. They're

260
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,540
in fact, they're already letting you download stuff. So, you know, but that's through their system.

261
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,380
You know, we're going to have two systems with huge downloads running across the same network that

262
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,260
it only one party is paying for. I'm telling you, it's a train wreck. It's something very bad

263
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:38,580
is going to happen. Hey, Adam. This is the nylon from Wimbledon. So, let me say, I appreciate your kind

264
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:45,060
of editorial correction when you're sure about my call. Thank you. This is subject though.

265
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:51,940
Is I want to get your reaction to a e-mocker report that predicted that advertisers will spend

266
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:59,620
about 400 million on the podcast by 2011. And they say that compares to about, I think,

267
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:05,700
it was 40 million or 80 million last year. And that's compared to a 20 billion that they predicted

268
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,700
will be spent on online, advertised in 2007. So, basically, they're saying 400 million by 2011

269
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:17,540
on a 20 billion spend today's online, which sounds somewhat minuscule. So, one of the

270
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,700
goodger reaction, because this is your business, and you have been to capital behind you,

271
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,900
they've made assumptions. I just want to see if this jives at your view of where the podcast

272
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:32,660
business is going. And you're happy with that 400 million or what do you think of the assumptions

273
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,500
that may have made that a wrong estimation? Thanks. Well, very good question.

274
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,500
Good question. Okay. I know you're a scruncher. You don't have to tell me.

275
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:49,220
Yeah, I think it's way off. I think it's a very low number. I'm not sure. I'm not very familiar

276
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,940
with e-marketer. But I think that they're only look, they're not looking at brand advertising. I

277
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,780
believe that they're looking at the Google Adsense interactive budgets and how those are growing

278
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:05,700
and how those are being implemented and all of the metrics associated with it. I don't believe

279
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,820
that's where podcasting is going to make a difference. It's very hard to do contextual based

280
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:16,180
automatic insertions into podcasts. It's just hard. There's a lot of manual labor involved.

281
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:21,060
And while you're doing that, then you might as well really deliver the goods that brand advertiser

282
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:28,740
wants. So this is a big company's Pepsi Coke, KFC, McDonald's, Johnson & Johnson, Proctor &

283
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:34,260
Gamble, and Heiser Bush. Hey, look at what Anne Heiser Bush is doing. Anne Heiser Bush started their own

284
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:43,780
station. They know. Anne Heiser Bush beer marketers in general or any package goods. These people

285
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,540
are very, very smart. They know how to reach their audience. And actually, Anne Heiser Bush has

286
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:53,060
been having a very hard time with their products. They know how to reach the audience. But the

287
00:29:53,060 --> 00:30:01,460
audience is, you know, things have changed. These, you know, what do you call, Alco Pops?

288
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:08,260
You know, the mixed drinks that come in in beer bottle sizes. You know, that's what's really

289
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:13,780
ruling their bris, but their business. I know they used to be a client. I know some folks over there.

290
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,300
I think the general consensus is, you know, if you're drinking a beer, you don't get laid.

291
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,860
That's kind of so they need to turn that message around. And that's very, very hard to do. And so,

292
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,980
you know, they're saying, hey, you know, screw this. We're going to create our own culture, our own

293
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:35,380
content. And they've got Anheiser Bush TV. It's very, and they got the same very skilled people on this.

294
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:43,220
And they're spending millions of dollars huge investment. So I believe that a better strategy for

295
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:49,780
a company like that would be to find existing content that has the culture you want and work with them.

296
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:58,740
I mean, you know, in a sponsorship arrangement, because only those people who have that audience,

297
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,740
like you, you're my audience. You may, I know that there's some people who listen to me just to hate

298
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:08,980
me, and that people just listen for all kinds of reasons. But, you know, I know you and you know me.

299
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:14,740
And so, if I'm going to start advertising a product, you know why. And we have a way of discussing that.

300
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:21,220
Anheiser Bush can't come in and just jump in and start talking the way we do as the daily source code

301
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,620
family. All 12,000 of you.

302
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,740
You know, so I think it would be much smarter for brand advertisers to go look for these,

303
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,380
these groups of communities who have a clear, not a leader, but someone at the head is an audience.

304
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,980
You know, it's that everyone, all these companies are looking for customer engagement.

305
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,260
Yeah, that's what we call an audience, okay. Audiences feed back to the performance, whether it's

306
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:55,780
in the theater, whether it's in the movie theater, whether it's on the radio is a little tougher,

307
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,620
but, you know, phone calls, it's the same thing. That's big feedback. You know, that's what an

308
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:04,420
audience is. That's what brand advertisers are interested in. People who are listening to shows

309
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,980
because they really want to listen to them. And not because they just happen to, you know,

310
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:15,220
catch a, catch a great snappy song and then we'll hear the ad right after it, you know.

311
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:21,700
So I think, uh, e-marketer is it? E-marketer? Yeah. I think they're low. I think they're very

312
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,940
low because a lot of this money is going to come from other budgets that e-marketer does not track.

313
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:31,060
That don't think they track radio and television advertising spend, particularly radio.

314
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:39,220
And mind you, radio people have been so restricted. Radio media buyers and creative people who are in

315
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:47,220
creative audio advertising, which says a lot of very fucking smart people really creative and they get 15

316
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,220
seconds, you know, do your job. And there's so many more things that can be done.

317
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,660
They've been sitting around watching the interactive people, you know, just their budgets grow

318
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,780
and all kinds of euphoria. And, you know, they still have, you know, the radio buyers still have

319
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:07,620
kind of the same budgets and the same dreary kind of existence. You know, it's nothing much has

320
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,820
changed. That things only get more limited. And, you know, that's tougher to, to get what you want.

321
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,740
And the buy what you want and get the information you want is these companies have consolidated.

322
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,860
And, uh, they're, um, you know, they're also looking at diversifying their spend. So I think it's

323
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:27,140
going to be much much higher than that. Certainly by that timeline, I can see it. It's just,

324
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:32,260
it's going to be much more. I think that most advertisers now probably are dipping their toe

325
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:39,220
in the water at around 100 grand for a month campaign. Um, you know, so if they start to go full

326
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:45,060
time, the numbers start to go up pretty quickly. And I think that there's, you know, I've said this

327
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:51,300
before. It's going to turn around advertisers will literally have to audition to get on certain shows.

328
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,860
And it's not like, you know, like American Idol type of audition. But, you know, uh, we already

329
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,340
see this today. We have plenty of sponsors who, um, we think will fit with a show in the show.

330
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,620
So, man, I don't think I can sell that to my audience. I don't think they'll be interested or

331
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,860
I'm not interested or, you know, I don't know a way to make it work. I'm okay. Don't do it. Next one.

332
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,900
I got a couple more comments before I get out of here.

333
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:18,100
Hey, Adam, this is Don calling from the West Coast account. And, uh, just picking up on a comment,

334
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:25,140
you may in the DSC553 about trading water. And, uh, we're probably already trading water. We'll

335
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:33,220
in fact, we are already trading water. You know, United States has been buying water or access to

336
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:39,060
water rights from British Columbia since, well, probably in the 50s, but certainly in my generation,

337
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:47,380
certainly in the 60s, uh, United States sponsored huge hydroelectric projects here in, uh, British

338
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:53,540
Columbia to allow the control and flow of the Columbia river, which flows down into the United

339
00:34:53,540 --> 00:35:00,180
States. And, uh, they have, uh, basically sponsored, uh, some of these projects, uh, for the return

340
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:06,180
rights of having, uh, Canada not cut off large volumes of water going down into the states for two

341
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:11,380
reasons. One, the generation of hydroelectric power, which is, uh, is an extremely abundant resource

342
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:17,700
here in British Columbia, which gets sold at that very, very, very low rates down into the United

343
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:23,300
States. And, obviously, the continued flow of the Columbia river down into the United States,

344
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,180
so that farmers down south of the border can actually get access to the water for the purposes

345
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:33,220
of growing. So, uh, water trading, uh, on a global or an international scale,

346
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,900
it's been going on between the United States and Canada for many, many years. And, I'm not sure

347
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,540
if you're aware of that, just like, yeah, uh, this stems from, uh, I can't remember exactly what

348
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:45,860
the comment was that I may, but I read after that, and before this, before I saw it, I heard this

349
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:54,660
comment. I read that, um, uh, what was it? It was about email, um, that, you know, the, the, the, the

350
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,980
idea of paying for email, even it was one cent, which, of course, would kind of stop spammers,

351
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,300
but also would raise the bar a little bit on the quality of, uh, of email. You might think a

352
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,580
couple minutes, but, you know, if you're sending it in 100 emails a day, it's a bucket day,

353
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,140
but for a spammer, it's, say, it's much tougher. Um, you know, everyone's like,

354
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,980
up in arms saying, that's impossible. And no one will pay for something that used to be free.

355
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,700
Water is a very good example. It used to be free everywhere. And we buy it in bottles a lot more

356
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,940
than you'd think. And, uh, and there is a lot of, and, and the comment, the next wars are going to

357
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:31,140
be about water. That's for sure. Brent from Podio Radio sent me an email, uh, perfect subject line,

358
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:36,100
subject lines really do catch your attention. You look very pretty today, Adam was a subject line.

359
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:41,380
Of course, I opened that up. Uh, Bo Hall loves you. Some kick ass music for the DSC. Of course,

360
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:46,740
on the PMN, the song is Hell and Ecstasy. The artist is Bo Hall. You'll love this guy. I've played

361
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:53,780
them before, I think, living in love or something like that. Yeah, I do take this. It's like country rock.

362
00:36:53,780 --> 00:37:00,260
Bo Hall on the DSC. Hell, ecstasy.

363
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:52,420
I can't even ever tell me you'll really leave me. I mean, it's not so bad.

364
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:59,940
Oh, you're serious, you're a girl who cried wolf. I don't believe you'll tell me why you

365
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:09,780
made the way you come back. But anyways, I'm done with this. See, I don't really want to hate you.

366
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:59,940
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

367
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:29,940
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

368
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:59,940
hey hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

369
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:08,200
or we'll wait until we got you from me and have to see.

370
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,280
Paul Hall, hell.

371
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,000
And next to see you find that on the Podsave Music Network links in the show notes

372
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
of dailysourcecode.com.

373
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Thanks to PD Love for another fantastic opening to the show.

374
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,040
I'll be back tomorrow.

375
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,380
It's going to be a weird week traveling to New York on Friday, then to North Carolina.

376
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:32,260
The reason why I'm in North Carolina on Saturday nights of Sunday is we're filming a new

377
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:37,140
episode of Port City PD and I play a role.

378
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,020
I have a cameo in the next Port City PD, so I can't wait for that.

379
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,580
They needed my clothing sizes, so I guess there will be costumes involved.

380
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:51,580
I'll be back tomorrow with a very sparkling clean teeth.

381
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,020
Talk to you then, bye-bye.

382
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,100
Another Port Show Podcast, stick it in your ear.
