00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,280
What do you like? I like to skate that play rock guitar

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,160
But I'm not that great. I like to go in dates and stay up late. I live in San Francisco and hang out on the hate

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Do you like the golden date? I did when I was eight maybe I can come and visit

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,840
Maybe you should wait so you're in really 47. I've kids no one the way through her pounds and I hate my life

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,720
Are you serious? Yes, well, I've got a secret to I'm not 20. I'm really 32

37
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,540
I checked out your pics and I like your style.

38
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,540
Sounds good, Susie.

39
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,540
All be your friend.

40
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,540
We can read each other again and again.

41
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,540
Come on in my case and post on the page.

42
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,540
Join my groups and guess my age.

43
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,540
You must be 18, how could you not?

44
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,540
You can't be in high school.

45
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,540
You're just too hard.

46
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,540
Let me send you pics for your personal collection.

47
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,540
I hope they inspire you and give you a smile.

48
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,540
Susie's a simple pixel.

49
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,540
The borderline's a cop side up.

50
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,540
It's door she was only 16.

51
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,540
It's my boy.

52
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,540
I haven't made any good friends.

53
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,540
I'm running like she's such a spitting.

54
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,540
I'm walking hard.

55
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,540
I'm going to sustain.

56
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,540
I'm going to get out of here.

57
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,540
If you don't believe us, here's a fun of story.

58
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,540
About when that marks and is unlike a finale.

59
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,540
Time to monitor truth is hidden from your eyes.

60
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,540
Fuck's didn't know that you was in for a surprise.

61
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,540
I've been dead for a while, but let's cut to the chase.

62
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,540
I don't know what you look like and I want to see your face.

63
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,540
I want to see my teeth.

64
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,540
I know who I am in someone.

65
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,540
You're not a woman in this whole time you lie.

66
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,540
You got me there?

67
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,540
I'm not really a female, but I'm a guy who protects me.

68
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,540
Go for me man.

69
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,540
So this is why it's bad to meet women online.

70
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,540
Living like behind the screen is a total waste of time.

71
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,540
Check.

72
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,540
Check.

73
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,540
Fuck.

74
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,540
I'm in a physician.

75
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,540

76
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,540

I'm sure.

132
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,660
on this my space page and I listened to the song a couple of days ago and I was like yeah

133
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,860
I'll play that went to the same page today and they've taken it down but it is available on iTunes

134
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,860
and that's where you heard this version from I don't know kind of the wrong song to choose

135
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,900
so that I got a bit of a headache left low it's a daily source code 572 coming to you

136
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,500
from Gilford in Surrey in the United Kingdom my name is Adam this is the daily source code

137
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,860
coming to you from the curry manner the the attic as it were oh let me see where shall I

138
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:46,900
wish I start today whether or not so nice I knew it's not going to be nice today in tomorrow

139
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,300
and that may pick up on Saturday I really hope so I really want to pick up my aircraft

140
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,420
here's something that's interesting Google notebook changed overnight I'm not quite sure if I like it

141
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,860
it's certainly a better aesthetic if you never tried this out you should it's kind of like an online

142
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,620
outline or only it doesn't quite function the same way it's changed a few things which I don't

143
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,540
like for instance when I add a new note it appears at the top instead of the bottom

144
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:19,060
and you can't just drag and drop that easily in the small notebook view but it's cool

145
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,940
and it's definitely expanding there's a lot more to it than there was I was going through the

146
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,740
news before I started I'm a little bit late today it's was at the left or two in the afternoon you

147
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:36,340
okay time I was watching the news what you know this thing with these 15 British Seaman is it

148
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:44,420
one one C woman and 14 C men who have been who have been held I guess captive by Iran this is weird

149
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:51,220
I don't like it at all you know and quite rightly I think Tony Blair has been making noise about this

150
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:59,140
saying hey you know hey screw this and now it's so childish and now Iran is saying we want

151
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:08,020
an apology you have to say uncle all right shove a new cup your ass motherfucker this whole thing

152
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,420
about territorial waters though it's a it's a very very complicated thing and it's not like

153
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,380
you know I don't think these guys want some covert operation I think this is just a political

154
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,900
move for some reason but it's a good one and it's working I think Iran definitely has our

155
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,980
attention who knows what's going on while we're all focused on this news media please let's see what's

156
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:36,420
going on in my own backyard a couple people sent me sent me this message this is a pretty big news although

157
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:43,140
still a bit confusing but Yahoo apparently will be offering unlimited email storage I have been using

158
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,420
the new Yahoo mail system a little bit kind of as an interim step where I was well I'm still in the

159
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,780
process of fixing fixing my Gmail and it has some of the same features you know I love the

160
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,980
short the keyboard shortcuts that's pretty cool but I'm pretty loyal I think at this point and

161
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:07,140
pretty locked into to Gmail but the unlimited storage is pretty interesting and will that be for

162
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,700
anyone is that for free users or only if you have the premium service which I have because if you

163
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,660
want to access your email through pop three or eye map or any of the protocols that have been around

164
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,340
for a thousand years and just work then you have to become a premium subscriber so I do pay extra

165
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,500
money for that and I wonder if that's going to be unlimited for everybody and of course

166
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,980
when you start to think about that you start to think about email as once again it's it could be a

167
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,660
very interesting distribution mechanism it is a store and forward mechanism it is a it's not quite

168
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,020
published subscribe but I think you know there's enough in there that we can make it publish subscribe

169
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,820
it certainly is something that really works efficiently for newbies people who are just figuring

170
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,820
this stuff out I know that if Patricia received the daily source code in her email every single day

171
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,180
no what am I saying she'd fucking ignore it

172
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:18,180
don't you dare even he's don't you dare possibly so much better on the DXC if you bring back lady

173
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:27,220
Smith at it again I email that to one to her Jeff you know I did that so and this is

174
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,380
subject line I said show tomorrow question mark and then I just attached this file I know she

175
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,820
was how to open the attachments so hopefully that'll work and we'll have a proper food bar Friday

176
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,540
which of course is good because next week I'll be in San Francisco portions of it in Los Angeles

177
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,740
it's going to be another one of those crazy weeks then I come back for about half a week and then we're

178
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:56,340
going on vacation yes and I think I'm going to pretty much unplug yeah it's uh I don't do that very

179
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:03,060
often and uh I think I really needed I just need to unplug I always have email with me and stuff

180
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,420
and follow along and check in but I really don't want to be doing any production of anything and

181
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,220
we can do best of charlie's or we could just wait we could just do nothing you're subscribed to

182
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,420
the feed right you know it'll show up when it's when it's time for it to show up

183
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,700
hey guess what I fixed my uh my ADSL router problems you're not going to believe this and thanks by the

184
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:30,340
way to people like Philist May who offered uh even offered an ADSL router for me to go pick it up

185
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:38,820
and and try and he'd keep pre-configured for me a bazil um from uh bubble boy's from Belgium right yeah

186
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:46,180
bazil bazil from from Belgium he's trying to help me pronounce his name better uh he also said a

187
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,500
whole bunch of technical information you're not going to believe what I found out and why I was

188
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,300
having all these intermittent problems remember yesterday I said that the Apple airports I had no

189
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,540
problem seeing them connecting to the network uh the ADSL part of this uh beautiful net it actually

190
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:08,180
is quite nice it's a very aesthetic looking uh modem router in one I'll get the model number for

191
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,260
I tell you what it is um I was seeing it on some computers and I had and I'd reset it to you know

192
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,060
to factory defaults just to make sure I wasn't messing anything up so it popped up as net gear

193
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,060
but I couldn't connect to it with any of the computers it by the way was sitting right next to the

194
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,020
Apple airport so you know there's no reason why I shouldn't be able to uh connect to it of

195
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,020
course that is one of these end routers which is backward compatible all the way down to the

196
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:39,780
802.11B standard so I had my question marks about that backwards compatibility until uh last

197
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,660
night Patricia who has a television in the kitchen and this is something we've had since the curry

198
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:50,340
cottage I have one of those uh transmitters that uh sits uh it's connected to our satellite box and

199
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,820
transmits whatever's being watched in the on the main television in the in the television room in the

200
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,380
media room how's that sound uh in the media media media suite a transmit it to the kitchen so she can

201
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,900
follow along and even if you change the channel you can walk back and forth and you don't really

202
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:12,100
have to miss anything she said oh my television sucks so what do you mean well look at it and I could

203
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,540
see the without even hearing the sound I could say I could see the repetitive um well first of all

204
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:24,100
lots of snowy picture uh and I could see this repetitive black bar in the middle uh kind of popping

205
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,340
on and off and scrolling up and down at regular intervals well I knew where that was coming from that's

206
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:34,580
obviously some kind of wifi device trying to connect or or scanning frequencies and and it went

207
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:42,260
oh wait a minute yes my brain went off I said oh I'm not gonna believe this so I disconnect this

208
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:48,980
transmitter boom I could see the the access point I've got to 1.5 megabits per second

209
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,260
can you believe that all this time the problem was not routing um and I'm sure that the the

210
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,820
ADSO mode on my head wasn't the best one and I know that these Apple airports can clog up a while

211
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,580
particularly if I'm I'm streaming porn on Windows media then after all you have to reboot them you know what I mean right guys

212
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:14,420
uh so all this time it was RF interference which makes so much sense so of course now

213
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,060
that I have the network uh fixed uh yeah and 1.5 megabits per second that's fine that's fast enough for me

214
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,460
we've only three people in the house we're not all sucking on the pipe at the same time

215
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,780
so that's gonna work just perfectly now I have to figure out a new solution for the television of course

216
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,540
the ultimate solution is to run a cable but you know it's really you know unless I pull up floor

217
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,820
boards or or something like that it's gonna suck it's gonna look shitty so here's the thought I had

218
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,260
and I wouldn't mind you weighing in on it and let me know what your thoughts are I was actually thinking

219
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,420
of putting a sling box onto the main set and then uh particularly with you know with this new fast

220
00:12:53,780 --> 00:13:01,620
with this new uh very funky spanky brand new router we should just be able to stream that

221
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,980
to Patricia's eye Mac in the kitchen or any other computer in the house for that matter

222
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,820
so that would be the the newfangled way and of course I could also then see it outside the home

223
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:19,140
which is also nice that's what the sling box is for or I could look for a different digital

224
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,580
transmitter pair or uh yeah I think that's about it those are about my options

225
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:32,260
um to let me know Adam at paucho.com tradition I'm off and running in the 100th time

this cool technology we can actually track his progress uh because of some uh whether something

251
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:26,740
now come on I can't have this sort of high pressure on me um couple of things um she might

252
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,140
talk about part testing the audience there was a little bit of a little disappointed because you

253
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:38,500
see one day I had a dream I had dream that part testing will be about the audience enlarging the

254
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:45,300
audience audience focused audience relevancy I had a dream that the part testing community would be

255
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,260
different from the mainstream it would it would be more tolerant that they would accept diverse

256
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,260
views in fact they would embrace a divergent view ensure I had a dream that the podcast in

257
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:05,540
world is going to be more inclusive oh I can't take it inclusive dude 80% of this show is the

258
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,860
audience what do you think's happening right now I'm embracing you come here come here nylon in my

259
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:19,780
arms let me embrace you when you're alternative views I want to include you I had a dream that

260
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:26,020
part testing itself was about controversy it was about freedom it was about autonomy it was about

261
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,660
independence it was about not letting the man dictate the way you're thinking the way you do things

262
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,980
I will come a little bit this morning and listen to the show and yeah that dream kind of crumbled

263
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,420
what are you talking about all the things you just mentioned right there controversy we don't

264
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:48,660
do controversy on this show we do controversy it was got inclusion every single time you send

265
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:56,100
something in if I put it on dude but also because it's interesting and for my own personal

266
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,020
benefit it's entertaining it is about audience participation it is about sticking it to the

267
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:08,500
man I think you need to keep go back go back to bed take some Tylenol PM and call me in the morning

268
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,740
sorry hopeful that dream may come true that we may be an inclusive and tolerant and caring

269
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,700
audience embracing those who have a view that's different finally not a banker not an IT guy not a

270
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,220
frequent visitor to London actually a resident of London but raised in bread in New York South Bronx

271
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,580
Jackson Mississippi taught you so and I know you're a scruncher you don't have to say it don't worry

272
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,700
about it but there's something going on with you nylon because not only and I'm sure you heard there's

273
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,100
another jingle the one I just played which is of course a Jeff Smith original and of course the

274
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:51,060
one that slowed it for you whoa he's an island outspoken expatriate he's in London buddy's from New York

275
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:59,700
whoa he's an island controversial my long he's in London buddy's from New York

276
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,700
hey mate says Phil just wanted to add my weight to the growing discussion on nylon I'm sick of his

277
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,100
corrections and correctness what a pompous bastard he should move on from his views and take a

278
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,460
wider look at everything you and your show is the essence of positiveness and looking forward

279
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,580
even CSB has a sense of humor when he runs I say scrap the nylon and his self inflated views

280
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:28,260
Phil I think that's a very sound advice but I can't I can't do it because we've got all these cool

281
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:35,300
jingles to play let's have a word with the nylon spread the news with the smile on where the

282
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:43,780
rollo right window for light let's listen well to the nylon yeah I don't have you been following

283
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:52,660
this story I'm gonna open it up right now BBC it's a one blogger let me see what is her name

284
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:01,780
Sierra right her last name is Sierra uh wait what's her first name oh man I suck okay

285
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,060
I don't know if you've seen this kind what is her first name I can't even find her first name

286
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,620
okay Sierra Miss Sierra as I read through the I'm I'm trying to talk and read at the same time which is

287
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:22,820
basically impossible for men she received a number of death threats on her blog and so this is whole

288
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,540
thing back and forth and they were they were definitely not nice you know like pictures of a news and

289
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:34,660
you know and talk of slicing her throat and I'm not gonna get into the whole thing but

290
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,620
turns out that someone who had accident you know someone's uh profile or identity or email was

291
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:47,300
hacks so someone else was clearly using that a fantastic story someone was apparently using

292
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:54,100
this other person's identity to post these uh well of course if you're threatening to kill someone

293
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,700
I'd say these illegal comments and so this is resulted in and I will put a link on the

294
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,700
in the show notes a daily source code dot com so you can read this story this is a result in

295
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:13,140
a call for a blogging code of conduct and let me see there was some excellent quotes here from

296
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,580
Miss Sierra uh here we go these people are interested in rage and they think that if you aren't

297
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,220
in rage then you are part of the problem it seems that they hate my optimism they think I am

298
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,100
poisoning people's minds with my positive outlook I guess she's a marketing consultant or something

299
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,740
she looks kind of hot in a milky sort of way which is nice so and then there's the you know

300
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,980
there's a lot of people weighing in saying oh this only happens with women a Kathy Sierra that's

301
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:45,220
her name I'm sorry Kathy Sierra um you know that women are more susceptible to this and I'm saying

302
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,500
bullshit I'm saying bullshit to the whole thing to the code of conduct bullshit to your uh every

303
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,940
single one of you is whiny you know your full of shit this is Andy Warhol's prediction come true

304
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,700
this is your 15 minutes of fame in this what's happened this what this is what happens

305
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:05,060
I've been getting death threats for half my life I've had people actually stick a fucking knife up

306
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,940
to my throat my Patricia would say because I'm not a very likable guy but it doesn't matter this is

307
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:15,540
what it is you know you put yourself out there you grow an audience this is exactly what's going

308
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:22,020
to happen it comes in all forms and it is it is it is hate it is rage but it says people projecting

309
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:28,100
it's so easy to do it get over yourself you know stop stop blogging that's the best for you stop

310
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,740
because this will never stop a code of conduct is not going to help it's human nature this is what

311
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,940
we're learning about the internet this is where this is human nature this is what we do is a human

312
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:45,140
race I've known it for 20 years we're sick but maybe on the other hand this is really beautiful

313
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,980
because people can say these things and and get them out there and and unload whatever tension they have

314
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,900
I got to think about that one but get over yourself you're fucking

315
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:04,660
blogging code of conduct oh yeah people it's the same thing as paper post that I've never talked

316
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,460
about that on the show because it's that everyone is fucking selling something you know whether you're

317
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:16,740
being paid by another company to to to to blog about something to post something you know or say

318
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,540
something favorable about a product look at your own weblog you're probably not saying that you're

323
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:55,940
for sure that it's going to take a lot more time for it to get a lot more worse before it gets any

324
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:05,780
better and that's with all media we're in the middle of one huge one huge confusion look at look

325
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:12,500
it I mean I'm from I remember we didn't have cell phones I'm sorry it sounds so lame but so much

326
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,300

327
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:24,020
and machetes work and one of those machetes is a beautiful wheelbarrow called serious satellite

very important sounding background music that it does add I have to agree jersey Todd sent me a gmail

342
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:57,860
subject of the email you'll get a kick out of this well you know Todd doesn't have to send me anything

343
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:05,940
with any subject and I'll still open it but he uh he points me to the site called it's pizzizz dot com

344
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:16,660
and uh pizzizz is what is it uh a personal life coaching system energy and stress health and fitness

345
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:25,620
hypnosis nlp system and what it is is well actually you know what let's listen to the yeah

346
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,860
I think it's the CEO or the founder have a thing of him on the website he'll explain exactly what

347
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:35,780
it is I'm fascinated by this stuff as you know with our infamous senseo berpa system we've proven

348
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:42,100
that advertising uh even just um well that wasn't really advertising I wasn't getting paid for it

349
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:48,100
but the things can be linked can be anchored in your mind so that when you see something

350
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:53,860
or you'll think of whatever it's anchored to I know that many people today still when they hear a

351
00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:00,820
burp think either daily source code or senseo hello I'm Edward Lying see a very relevant

352
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:08,500
Edward your audio sucks dude I hope you guys can hear it it's it's a little flash thingy on

353
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,020
their website let's just let me just see if if this is bearable

354
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:17,940
but I'm possessed because this was created to help people reach their full potential both at work

355
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:24,980
and at leisure and they're currently two suffer matches the first energizer is designed to help

356
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:31,380
you to relax, destress and re-energize the second module sleep to help you to switch off at the

357
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,700
end of a busy day and get the most beneficial and restful sleep possible unlike other relaxation

358
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:43,300
tapes and CDs because this software allows you to choose the length of this time anything between

359
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:50,100
10 and 60 minutes okay now I realize that in the middle of this I downloaded this wonderful demo

360
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:57,620
they had they've made available and uh I can't find it oh crap hold on a second I want to see if

361
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:03,620
this stuff actually works okay I've got it here check this out

362
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:16,820
now that you've taken this time to rest and recharge it's a good idea to ensure that you'll not be

363
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:23,220
and that you can be as comfortable as possible both physically and mentally find a position for

364
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,180
your body where you can relax completely so that it's easy for you to let go of the events of the

365
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:33,060
day so far for a little while that you'll get as much benefit as possible from this time out

366
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:42,260
you can continue relaxing comfortably while I offer some preliminary ideas and suggestions

367
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:50,020
for a little more great 12-chus coffee at any time you can make my voice fade into the background

368
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:56,740
gently relaxing your attention to what has was comfortable and split down pleasant and solid

369
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:05,940
split down better sugar all you need to do is let you body in your mind become and

370
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:15,140
relax to try not be an effortless and efficient man and when you're never in time it's

371
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:24,420
complete I'm going to wait until we join your day and relax to refresh and I'm going to

372
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:30,500
wow now simply relax okay I got to turn this down because I'm too relaxed

373
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:38,580
is this love you know check this out pauses.com and download their free I think it's like a

374
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:45,220
like a 15-minute free energizer track listen to this stuff just really jammed the buds in really

375
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:52,340
really derives if you haven't already take a moment to stretch your body you're neck

00:29:52,340 --> 00:30:08,660
arms hands back legs and feet and allow yourself to look sure it in that feeling

384
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,340
I've another day when I get away from the walls that keep me there why do I care up so

385
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:29,940
I want to wear up the reasons that I sit and stare at to the scene man on the screen I
