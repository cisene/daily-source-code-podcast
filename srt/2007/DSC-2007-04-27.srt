00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

In the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm testing this out of Korea.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
On the moment he's so bad.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Everybody seems to be mad.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Come and choose it, I feel better.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Even my own man looks good.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
When they just don't go, let me go too slow.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will run in my mind.

17

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But yeah, I've had money on my man.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Who looked at this light once before?

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Who looked at the melted world?

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Who had working for the rich man?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000

Easy, mate.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I've got Friday on my mind.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Boy, do I ever,

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
it is daily source code episode number 590 coming to you from San Francisco.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The Curry Condo, Maximum Music, and completely fully footballer to everybody.

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You know the rules.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Whether it's morning or evening for you.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Football.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm here to make sure that my message gets through.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm wondering if you're really all as dumb as you look.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
All rights money up to level who's in my book.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have to keep what I stand at the knowledge I'm putting.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Put me in the position of a God of a King.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Cause I'm blessed with a gift of the magic touch.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And I'm worth it saying that I'm asking for too much.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
All you have to do is get that on your knees on point.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And I promise you the remedy is on it's way.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But you've never been on me so don't waste your time.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Cause I'm waiting so free my position is going to lie.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What's wrong with me itself is this?

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's the price and it's gonna be your second best.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I got the gift and I know I don't waste.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And I gotta get it on my chest.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What do you think is the best?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Better than the best.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Better than the best.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And what do you think is the best?

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Better than the best.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Better than the best.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm not afraid of competition.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Cause I know that I'm the best.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And you've ever got a chance to even pass my little test.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Even if you wanted to, you could've paid up.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why is it the right?

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No proof of losers in my perfect power and dice.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Could you write this up with me?

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The problem rate of your success.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So I'll make sure that I get the monster not there.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If I want myself and everyone who love me too.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And there's nothing you can do for me that I can do.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What do you think is the best?

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Better than the best.

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,880
And I'm just waiting to do a new sunrise

187
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,880
When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough

188
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,880
She's a sense of comfort coming in from above

189
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
We don't need to let it all

190
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
We're gonna wave in the air

191
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,880
We're gonna love

192
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
We're gonna love

193
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
We're gonna love

194
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
We're gonna love

195
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
We're gonna love

196
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
We're gonna love

197
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880

201
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
We're gonna love

202
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
We're gonna love

203
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
We're gonna love

204
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
We're gonna love

205
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
We're gonna love

206
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Just realize that song is 34 years old

207
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
It's moving into its 35th year

208
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,880
And still sounds like it was produced yesterday

209
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Unbelievable

210
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,440
We moved our Friday when he worked up beyond all

211
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,920
We've hear girls here in three and a half

212
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
And nobody was anything sleepin' without

213
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,800
We're facilitron

214
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:09,880
You know, what's up, I'm Jersey Todd, the official musicologist of the Chacha.

215
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,380
Hey man, I love your discussion the other day regarding internet radio and all the crap

216
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,880
that they're trying to pull up and trying to put these people really out of business.

217
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,880
And I thought that it would be important, none of whom are Friday to bring some more

218
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
voices into the discussion.

219
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,880
I'd like to bring you a promo that was put up on the Ponce of Music Network

220
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
by the Trucky Brothers.

221
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Check this out.

222
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
They're out of San Diego.

223
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Folks, this is the Trucky Brothers.

224
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
Hey.

225
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
We want to talk to you about internet radio.

226
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
Yeah man.

227
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Internet radio has been a way for us to get our music to you.

228
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
That's right.

229
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
It gives us a chance to be heard.

230
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
Yeah.

231
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,880
A recent decision by the copyright royalty board is threatening to silence independent artists like us.

232
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Those bastards.

233
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,880
And significantly limit what you get to hear.

234
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Those bastards.

235
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,880
But change starts with people like you out there.

236
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Yeah.

237
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
You're not the greedy mofoes out there.

238
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,880
But you call or write your congressman today.

239
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
You spell check.

240
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,880
And let them know that you don't want internet radio silenced.

241
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,880
And make sure you don't have a caller ID and stuff like that so they can know what number you are.

242
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Because they'll find you man.

243
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
I know.

244
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
They'll find you.

245
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,880
And then after you take care of that, you can also visit SaveNetRadio.org.

246
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,880
For more information on how to help.

247
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:33,880
You may never know how important internet radio is until you can't hear it any longer.

248
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
You hear that?

249
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
I hear a playing.

250
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,880
That's internet radio gone.

251
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
Sounds like a playing.

252
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,880
It's without internet radio.

253
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
See, that's the truck you brothers.

254
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
But they're not going to get away that easy.

255
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,880
They're not just going to get away with doing a promo.

256
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
No, no, no, no.

257
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Check out this song, Adam.

258
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
Because it is that good.

259
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Check this out.

260
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
It's the truck you brothers with Formula O.

261
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Formula O.

262
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,880
I can't get in the head.

263
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,880
Sing to me a little bit.

264
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Every choice that I made just another little way.

265
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
All right.

266
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
I won't be able to live.

267
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,880
I'll hunt the feet on the face.

268
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Especially in cash of mine.

269
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Laces place less.

270
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,880
My trace is trace less.

271
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Never give it down.

272
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,880
Get back.

273
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
There are lots of advice.

274
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,880
If I give them right cool thingers.

275
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Not play a merry, win a waltz with my ship going down in the desert.

276
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm in the night of mine.

277
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,880

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,880

Yeah, why did God's home, can I bust?

324
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Do you suppose he had a bust?

325
00:22:51,720 --> 00:23:00,720
When he made the mettle bust, when he created a farphone

326
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Does he like the girl jam or the stone?

327
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Do you think he rolls his own

328
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,720
I'm there in heaven on the floor

329
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
What do you think?

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,720
And when the Saints go marching home

331
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Does he not?

332
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,720
Maybe he sits in so much trouble

333
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,720
I gotta tell you, I haven't had this much fun in ages

334
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:39,720

To listen to and meet Matthew Ebo, it's going to be a blast

359
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
We're looking forward to seeing you there

360
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,720
How can you love me when you don't know who I am?

361
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,720
These pictures got a lot more feeling from a bloodstained dirty hand

362
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,720
And all I know is I was blind to get you a blinding friend

363
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,720
I've been on one level for a whole year old

364
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
For a whole year old, for a whole year old, for a whole year old

365
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
For a whole year old, for a whole year old, for a whole year old

366
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
For a whole year old, for a whole year old, for a whole year old

367
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
For a whole year old, for a whole year old, for a whole year old

368
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,720
For a whole year old, for a whole year old, for a whole year old

369
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,720
For a whole year old, for a whole year old

370
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,720
I've been accused of a crime, a death from this

371
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,720
My baby loves me, gives me everything I need

372
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,720
She'll make a crown out of our plight

373
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,720
And I'm happy just to bleed

374
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,720
She knows that I've been trying hard to take my leave

375
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,720
She likes guns, she makes love like a lightning

376
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,720
But it's like poison in a sun, as dreaming

377
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,720
I'm wasting my time again again

378
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Oh yeah

379
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,720
I've been accused of a crime, but it's hard in this film

380
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,720
No one ever told me they would only like to move down

381
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,720
With the pins and needles that stand in a way

382
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,720
With the wires, everybody told me I'll be just fine

383
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,720
But it's my time to bring that bitter white

384
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Nobody loves you, but I ask you get it back

385
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,720
I won't keep wasting my time again again

386
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,720
But a better day than I've found out

387
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I can't so use that as crime, but it wears kind of fear

388
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,720
I won't keep wasting my time again again

389
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,720
I've been accused of a crime, but it's hard in this film

390
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,720
I've been accused of a crime, but it's hard in this film

391
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,720
I won't keep wasting my time again again again

392
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Oh yeah

393
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,720
I'll keep living like a different guy

394
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Definitely a friend of the Charlie Matthew Ebel's wasted my time

395
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,720
I keep it on my skin

396
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:07,720
I'm a man, this guy extra blogger episode is the shit man

397
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,720
There was a greatest moment in podcasting history ever

398
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,720
You gotta get that guy on the show on a weekly basis

399
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,720
To have the back and forth between you two

400
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Man, he was an expert from anybody

401
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
I just want to let you know that that was great

402
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,720
I can't imagine anybody wanting to fast forward that stuff

403
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,720
It was hilarious, he put up man

404
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Hello?

405
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Hey baby, it's me

406
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720

Pound on your feet

Everybody wants to look like they look at a bone on your knees

413
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,720
Everybody wants to smile at this moment

414

Pound on your knees

Nobody wants to die, no one dies in the corner of me

And I swear I won't tell you that you take too long

431
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
You don't want to wear that dress

432
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720

And the tools that we all have available at our fingertips

457
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
When I was in broadcast radio come on

458
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,720
I'm a mone here, let grandpa Curry tell you a little story

459
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
You would have request lines

460
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
You know how on the radio it sounds like

461
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Of course people are saying hi

462
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Hi, it's Kelly

463
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Well, you're calling from Kelly

464
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
I'm calling from Trinity

465
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Kelly and Trinity, what do you want to hear?

466
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
I want to hear J-Loam

467
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
And of course J-Loam is playing

468
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Now it's not like we're sitting around as this jockey's on the radio

469
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Waiting for you to request the songs

470
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
We've got to play these songs in the water

471
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
The list that they were sent in

472
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
They were programmed by

473
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Whatever programs that stuff

474
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,720
And what we do is you just wait until someone calls

475
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
And request the next song on the list

476
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Not so in podcasting my friends

477
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
Not only are you sending me the songs

478
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
But you're providing your own intros

479
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720

That I hate

Sometimes it's crazy bitch

500
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
Even the fingers from my dinner

501
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,720
Sometimes it's crazy bitch

502
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,720
They hate it on the inner state

503
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Music

504
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720

Walk along my shoes a star

506
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,720
Sometimes it's crazy bitch

507
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,720
Like that standing at the bar

508
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Sometimes that crazy bitch

509
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
It's a shit just a little too far

510
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,720
Sometimes it's crazy bitch

511
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,720
They did in the trunk of my car

512
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Sometimes those creeps

513
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Bitch, do we kill for me at the beginning

514
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,720
I know because I asked my mom about you

515
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,720
She can't believe me

516
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
I know how you wake me up

517
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
A heart that hurts me

518
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,720
I'm just trying to understand

519
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Why do you need me this way

520
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes it's crazy bitch

525
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
That's when she's gonna kill her

526
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
Sometimes it's crazy bitch

527
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
Sometimes those creeps

528
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Bitch, do we kill for me at the end

00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
Sometimes it's crazy bitch

530
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720

If the club I'd like to pay

537
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
Sometimes it's crazy bitch

538
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,120
I don't know.

539
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Sometimes it's crazy bitch

540
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Tough enough but it's true

541
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Sometimes it's crazy bitch

542
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Sometimes it's crazy bitch

543
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Sometimes it's crazy to my bed with the three feet

544
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Sometimes it's a breeze, it's like a dead energy stream

545
00:36:47,720 --> 00:37:14,720
What's playin' on me?

546
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,720
I'm the very eve of the release of the iPhone, which of course will be the device that is supposed to replace

547
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:29,720
All of your iPods in your cell phone simultaneously in accordance with John C. The Vorac will be the demise of the company known as Apple

548
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:38,720
It's time to check out my first generation iPod now, you know what it's like if things have become so ubiquitous and cheap you get tons of them

549
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
I got a video iPod

550
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,720
This is the original one of those fat fuckers

551
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:51,720
So of course this is the part of the show where I can run into a lot of trouble because we never know what's going to come off of Adam Curry's first generation iPod

552
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
All right, let me just plug in the wires here

553
00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:00,720
I'm putting it on random, I'm going to forward through just hit first for the next song a couple times

554
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,720
So we know that we're not going to get the same ones we got last time and see what happens here

555
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
I'm hearing anything

556
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Well, of course, why wouldn't it be food bar?

557
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
How was this?

558
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,720
Is my iPod busted now? My first gen iPod?

559
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,720
Oh crap

560
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Oh no

561
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
This is totally harsh in my mellow

562
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
This is

563
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
Oh, oh, here we go

564
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Oh, yes, and then a cherry

565
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Cool

566
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Let's introduce

567
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
You may dance

568
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
Right now

569
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
If you feel like

570
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,720
It's a buffalo stand

571
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,720
They all came running, they were making noise

572
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Man, hallowing toys

573
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
That's a girl from the box with a neck

574
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,720
They could wear padded bras

575
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
I can be a fool, I can be a fool

576
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
I can down the floor

577
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
But if you get to us

578
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
I'm on top

579
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
I'm on top

580
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,720
I'm on top

581
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
I'm on top

582
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
I'm on top

583
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
I'm on top

584
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,720
I'm on top

585
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
I'm on top

586
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
I'm on top

587
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
I'm on top

588
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,720
I'm on top

589
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
I'm on top

590
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,720
I'm on top

591
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
No money man

592
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
We're not love

593
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,720
It's sweet next day

594
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
I'll think you know

595
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
We always hang in a bottle stand

596
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,720
We do the diving now

597
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
Staying out

598
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
I keep you love baby, not romance

599
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
I make a moon up to love

600
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,720
James and Don't you get the pressure with me

601
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
I can't so keep you

602
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720

Don't you get fresh in your eyes?

776
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,920
even 1980, 1981, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops,

777
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,080
that's not supposed to happen.

778
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,360
You know what?

779
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,920
Let's see, how many minutes have we been doing this?

780
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,160
Whew, I've literally been dancing around the condo.

781
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,840
I gotta tell you, it's just been really, really cool.

782
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,400
And liberating and just letting off steam.

783
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,360
I hope you're gonna have a fantastic weekend.

784
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,720
Monday, I'll be back at the manner.

785
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,640
Of course, Lady Patricia on her way to the Netherlands

786
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,240
for some show business stuff.

787
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,360
But I'm looking forward to being back home.

788
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,040
Even if I'm just gonna see her for one day,

789
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,880
it's gonna be good to be.

790
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,680
You know what, here's what I'm gonna do.

791
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,120
Let's break this, break in the law.

792
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,640
Let's go breaking the law.

793
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,920
Do you have a playlist on your iPod

794
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,000
that you've titled something like Happy Songs

795
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,600
or Happy Music or Good Moot or something like that?

796
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,440
I think everyone has something like that.

797
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,520
What is your playlist called?

798
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,520
The one that you have all the Happy Songs in?

799
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,600
Because what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll

800
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,520
us out towards the weekend.

801
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,080
In fact, I'm gonna say goodbye now.

802
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,080
Let me, let me, I can't say goodbye without, of course.

803
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,400
Doing that.

804
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,160
Let you know that all the songs played on today's program

805
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,520
will be in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

806
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,640
Of course, you can send anything you want to meet at atpodshow.com.

807
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,920
There's also some voice mail lines.

808
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,280
Go to the to the site to get the numbers.

809
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,760
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna play at random,

810
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,800
a song from my happy list.

811
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,040
So I know that regardless of what the song is,

812
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,680
and of course, this is a total crap shoot.

813
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,040
I know that it's gonna really take us into a really,

814
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,240
really good, happy vibe for the weekend.

815
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,560
Okay?
