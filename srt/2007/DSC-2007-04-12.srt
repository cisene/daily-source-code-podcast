Kicking off there the source code

38
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
You brought it up in your cell

39
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
You brought it on your cell

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Kicking off there is a source code

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,240
You brought it on your cell

42
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Kicking off there is a source code

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,960
everybody. I'm back in, you know, blighty, whether it's beautiful today. And I, of course,

44
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,600
apologize about the show yesterday. I completely fucked it up, completely miscalculated all my

45
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,600
flight times. I was lucky enough that I had done the series satellite radio production the day before.

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,200
I was all, you know, all set and ready. I'm like, I want to get home. I'll do a show and I'll just

47
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,240
say, you know, I want to have to hurry and already, include in the satellite repairman, Master PWB said,

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,920
dude, it's going to be a little bit late to show, but I'll get it done. I had completely forgotten

49
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,360
two things. One, the flight from Los Angeles left at 10 minutes to nine last night. So normally,

50
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,760
I get in, you know, I'm home around 10, 30. It's like I could have kind of figured out that leaving,

51
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,080
it's leaving at nine instead of four for five hours later that that would change something. Also,

52
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,160
it's an hour longer to fly from Los Angeles to the to London. And when you think about it,

53
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,960
you know, San Francisco, North California, Los Angeles Southern California, you think,

54
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,040
you know, it's about the same distance. But of course, that is when you look at the flat map,

55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,400
and not the actual way the globe works because if you look at how the airplane flies, it actually

56
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,080
goes up over Canada. And then, you know, through parts of Canada, through Greenland. So,

57
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,080
and that is the most direct route, even though it looks counter-intuitive. So, of course,

58
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,600
you know, it's there's still an hour between San Francisco and Los Angeles. So I didn't get home

59
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,320
until, like, 530, although I did sleep very nicely on the plane, probably of the 10 and a

60
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,360
half hour flight. I think I slept six, maybe even seven hours. So that was really quite spectacular.

61
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,800
However, I do have to say some things, you know, I'm always really happy to report on my experiences

62
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,200
on Virgin Opera class. Not quite the experience I am used to. And I'll just tell you why I'll

63
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,800
indulge you for a moment as you indulge me. First of, at Los Angeles, they don't have, it's not

64
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,120
a Virgin Atlantic hub or it's not a home base. They just happen to fly from there. So they

65
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,560
have a shared lounge, which is okay, you know, it's, you know, it's not all the same cute

66
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,480
red outfit girls and boys walking around. So that was kind of a bummer. And they fly air buses

67
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,480
for some reason. I do not like the air bus. It's the, yeah, what is it? The three,

68
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:47,440
crap. No, I don't know which air bus it is. It's a 34360-600 or something or 320. I don't remember.

69
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,680
But it's boring. It's a boring configuration. In fact, if you look at the upper class, which

70
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,160
comprises at least a quarter of the airplane, it almost looks like a drawing of one of those

71
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
slave ships. You know, we're all the slaves. We're just laid out one by one. By one, of course,

72
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,680
we're not chained down. I don't want to draw any real comparison to that horrible, you know,

73
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,880
to the horrible slave ships. But it's exactly what it looks like and what it feels like. And I knew

74
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,720
that something was was a miss. And if they had only told me at the front of the journey instead of

75
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,360
at the end of the journey, I wouldn't have minded so much. Because I could tell, it wasn't,

76
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,440
it's coordinated as always. And things just weren't happening the way I see them usually operate

77
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,000
on, on virgin upper class. And they were forgetting things and a lot of people walking back and

78
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,480
forth. I don't know. It just didn't feel right. And at the very end, as we're, just everything,

79
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,960
everything was wrong. I could tell. You know, it's like you were watching a stage production and,

80
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,600
and you know, there was like all the subs were on that night. I'm not quite sure what it was.

81
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,760
And of course, I had no idea if the flight crew was subs or not, the flight deck crew, that is.

82
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,760
But anyway, at the end, there's announcements. Oh, and by the way, ladies and gentlemen,

83
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,480
would you please congratulate and I forgot her name? Marjorie, Maggie, Sarah, whatever,

84
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,160
something like that. Our flight manager, who is essentially in charge of all of the flight

85
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
staff except for the flight deck crew, it was her first time as flight manager. And I'm like,

86
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,520
oh, of course, of course, it makes sense now. You know, she was a rookie getting a getting her

87
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,200
feet wet. And then when I realized who it was, I was like, she's the one person who was walking

88
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,040
around like her shit didn't stink. So, you know, whereas, you know, people were congratulating her

89
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:44,720
on the way out. It's like, you know, she sucked. It really, it wasn't all that good. And you could

90
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:52,080
really tell that the flight crew was just not being managed. They were managing her. And so,

91
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,480
if it's already, I understand people have to learn the ropes, but it would have been much nicer

92
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,240
if they told me, told me upfront. Anyway, that was before I forget annex from Oklahoma,

93
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,520
kick the show off there. I'd love song, of course, from the Ponte music network. I love the song

94
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,440
that uses explicit words, because you know, those guys will never get played anywhere except

95
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,600
on podcasts and independent media, not on the mainstream. I'm just reading a bit from a bio

96
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,040
walking to an annex show and gets smacked with a wall of sound. This is a rock band. The marshals

97
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,440
are dialed high. The Les Pauls are cranked. Middle finger split the glaring lights to say,

98
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,840
fuck, all of you, we're here to rock guitar, slap you in the face, drums, drown out your hardbeat,

99
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,440
lights buzz with the, and that's it. The bio ends there. As anyone else played this song,

100
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,880
let me just check for a second. Expat radio and morning, morning word. Okay. So, I'm not the

101
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,880
only one. Awesome song dudes. Hey, some fascinating news. You remember when I started popping

102
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:00,160
through the pop three protocol, my Gmail from my original account to my Google apps email account

103
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,480
and it was, let's see, it was four. It was about four gigs worth of information. Of course,

104
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,320
all that really needed to happen if if this was a smart thing was, you know, to have some way over a

105
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Gmail to just say, okay, all this mail that is marked as a full bar boy at the time. Now it's marked

106
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,600
as, you know, at amaccurry.com and we wouldn't have to transfer. So I was actually doing a very stupid

107
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,080
inefficient thing by transferring my mail from one Gmail account to the other. So you can imagine

108
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,920
that four gigs, four gigabytes worth of data is quite a lot to shop, you know, to ship from one

109
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,920
end to the other. When did I start this four weeks ago? To this morning? Finally, all four gigs

110
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,360
have been popped and deleted from my original Gmail account. I'm telling you, it took about

111
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,280
four weeks to get it from point A to point B. What a waste of resources.

112
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:22,320
You know, what's up, Adam? It's Jersey Todd, the official musicologist of the

113
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,160
Chacha. Hey, let's do it. I know it's not food bar Friday or anything, but I wanted to turn

114
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,120
you onto something that I'm doing over at my website at jerseytodshow.podshow.com. This week,

115
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,600
I've got a really special interview that this guy's been on with Colin Quinn and Van and Conan

116
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,120
O'Brien and David Letterman and Jay Leno. And now he's on with Jersey Todd. It's Paul McCurrio,

117
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,240
Paul won an Emmy Award and a Peabonnie Award, writing for John Stewart's Daily Show. And now he's

118
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,160
with me. So just let everybody know, check out the show. It's posted now at jerseytod.podshow.com.

119
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,560
And what's really fantastic is that Paul basically gave me the same advice that you gave me.

120
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,160
I taught man, don't quit the day job. Oh, man. Talk to you later. All right, Jersey Todd, love

121
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,320
that sound to my brother. Jersey Todd got himself a mixer and a microphone and all kinds of new stuff

122
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,600
sound and pretty good, man. Sound and pretty damn good. By the way, we will do the plan

123
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,680
is to do a full bar Friday show tomorrow. Since we're leaving very early in the morning for our

124
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,640
Tenerife destination, I'm hoping to drag the lady pee up here later on tonight so we can do a

125
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,880
nice short shout out show and have some fun. And she's also, you know, this project, this secret

126
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,160
project, she's been working on for a couple of weeks. I'm hoping with a little bit of luck that

127
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,280
I'll be able to let you hear some of that secret project. So hopefully that'll be on tomorrow's

128
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:47,360
football Friday show. Yeah, I noticed when I don't play the voicemail numbers, you guys basically

129
00:11:48,160 --> 00:12:07,760
don't call in that much. Hi, Adam. This is Tony Sones here. I've just got

130
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,400
meaning new Nokia N95 and of course straight away then we did the podcasting software. Unfortunately,

131
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,920
it wasn't included, but it was a freely available in the Nokia web page. Then I decided to look

132
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,240
for the� source code, but couldn't find any idea and how to do it on your web page or an iTunes,

133
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,720
but opened up the podcasting software and they're right underneath the Nokia podcast,

134
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,480
was the daily source code. Number one, so hopefully lots of people will start using this

135
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:45,520
bit. Love the N95, love the daily source code. Cheers. Y'all know. Yeah, folder. But of course. Yeah,

136
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,560
so thanks for calling that in by the way. Yeah, that podcasting application isn't

137
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,160
indeed quite cool. And I have to install it yet again on another new piece of hardware because

138
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,440
the candy man sent me. Hello. Oh, my goodness. Hold on a second. This is the Christina Interpromptus.

139
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,960
Guys, let me see. Hunt turn around. Yeah, it's it's audio. So you have to like talk and say something.

140
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,360
Okay, so they don't think I'm just jerking off here. Wow. Wow. That looks beautiful. Hold on a second.

141
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,640
Can I take a picture? Yeah. Hold on. Oh, my goodness. Wait, wait, let me, let me get my

142
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,120
camp out. Shit. You have to move that way a little bit there because you're too tall for the

143
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:36,080
move forward a little bit. Yeah, and oh my goodness. Oh, boy. I'm in so much trouble.

144
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,720
Yeah, let me do another one. Let me take another shot. Oh, now stand straight. Let me see.

145
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,680
Let me see, baby. Oh Holy shit. Okay, can I post that on my site on the show site?

146
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,320
I know. I know. We understand it has to be tailored. I get it. Again, fantastic. That's beautiful.

147
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,280
When is the prom? The 11th of May? Okay. All right, now get the hell out of here. I'm doing a shot.

148
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,880
Bye. Beautiful, huh? Oh, my goodness. Wait until you see that. Careful, so it doesn't catch on.

149
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,040
Oh, careful. Careful, careful. The train is catching on the door. Oh, my goodness.

150
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:26,320
Prom time. Crap. Okay, so I already kind of gave it away. I mean, I just used it to take a picture.

151
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,520
Now, you know, I'll just say, you know, we talk about a lot of stuff here on the source code. To

152
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,480
always really happy when people go out and buy products that I'm talking about, whether we're paid for it or not.

153
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,160
So the Nokia stuff, you know, this is just candy. I get paid for, you know, personally by getting new

154
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,320
gadgets and shit, but there's no, no deal. Of course, except for bone,

155
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,480
contestants compete for an N800 internet tab with bone.podshow.com. That show is off the rails.

156
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,400
Like 50,000 downloads, you know, the first couple days, unbelievable. That would be what I

157
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,320
consider an out of the box hit. That's awesome. Okay. Anyway, so candyman Luke from Nokia and

158
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,880
Finland had sent me a man who said, I do. I got a little present on the way for you. I was able to score an

159
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,600
E61 eye. As you know, I bought the E61 a while ago. It was very happy with it because it has

160
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:25,920
Wi-Fi built in. And in fact, the one thing I said it really missed was a camera. So I came home

161
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,280
yesterday, fully aware that this thing was ahead already been sent and then probably arrived about a week ago.

162
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,440
And so, you know, after I say hi, you know, we have a cup of tea and like, you know, I asked

163
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,880
really innocently like, um, did anything come in the mail for me? You know, anything package,

164
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,920
perhaps? Yeah, but there's like, yeah, there was a package that put it upstairs. Okay, I'll check it in a moment,

165
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:54,080
with like 30 seconds. I'm like, oh, boy. Let me just go check upstairs. I couldn't wait to open it.

166
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:01,760
Complete finished porn. Let me tell you. This thing is beautiful. There's a few changes between the E61

167
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,520
and the E61 eye that I just want to tell you about. First of all, the camera. It's a two megapixel

168
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,520
camera, which functions very nicely. The whole device looks just like the E61 only. It's thinner

169
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,960
and it looks a lot more expensive. They really did a good job on the outside. They've given me

170
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,920
more shortcut buttons. Also, the keys themselves feel different like they have it, like it's either

171
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,400
different surface, either that or the E61, the the old keys, maybe they felt like that in the

172
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:34,560
beginning, too, and it just rubbed off. But it feels like there's a much more, um, what is the word?

173
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,880
Maybe tactile, I guess. You could really feel the keys a lot better. Now, the thing that

174
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,920
that I have to kind of get used to here is instead of, um, a little ant dig sticking out that you

175
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,120
use as your mouse. Uh, they've changed that to, uh, well, let's, let's call this a belly button.

176
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,840
A belly button mouse, a square belly button, but a belly button mouse nonetheless, uh, which is a

177
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,840
little tricky. It takes a little bit of getting used to because my, my fingers are used to sitting

178
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,680
on a little ant dig thing, a little pointer, a little plastic pointery thing, which I have to say,

179
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,760
cheap. It really does compared to this. My thumb will slip off now, and I might hit the email

180
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,160
button, but I'll get used to that. Uh, something that changed in the interface, I like very much.

181
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,760
Now, the, um, kind of like the desktop, if you will, uh, give you all, instead of a popping up, um,

182
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,720
big pop-up windows, like you missed a call, which takes up almost half of the screen, uh,

183
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,680
now all of that appears on the kind of like desktop itself. It has, uh, some smart, uh,

184
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,560
Wi-Fi scanning stuff, which I haven't quite figured out yet, but it continues to search for Wi-Fi

185
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,240
access points. Uh, excuse me, Tylenol PM, how come you guys aren't trying this out and telling me

186
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,160
about it? Will you please? They're sponsoring not just this show, but unwind by Angie B.

187
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,480
So anyway, um, really nice. Now, one thing that bummed me out totally, because I was all set, you know, I'm

188
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,680
like I backed up my, uh, oh, my data, my E61 onto my internal memory card. I took it out. I'm like,

189
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:04,800
I'm going to stick it into the E61 eye. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, no, because these guys keep doing it.

190
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,720
You know, first they shrunk down the, uh, the power plugs to those little ant decks.

191
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:18,320
Now, instead of taking a mini SD card, which I have about five of, you have to have a micro SD card.

192
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,640
What is it with you guys in Finland? It's like everything has to be small.

193
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,160
So now you've got the, the micro dick slot, which, uh, so now I've got to go out and buy a different

194
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,680
card to put that in. It is hot swappable. So that's, uh, that's a cool upgrade feature, I guess. So you

195
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,680
can, without turning it off or taking the battery out, you can swap the card in now. But these things

196
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,520
are so small. How are we going to carry these around? You know, already I've got, uh, I've got, uh,

197
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,720
the US maps in my wallet. So when I'm in the States, I can swap out a card on my N800.

198
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,920
You know, we have, we'll have to have wallets with special little pockets for all these micro

199
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,760
things. It really is the future. You know, we have all those, uh, you see all the science fiction

200
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,920
shows, right? Where you have shit embedded in your head and, you know, little micro micro chips that

201
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,080
you carry around huge amounts of data on. I mean, that shit was futuristic a couple of years ago.

202
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,280
It's actually here. It's actually happening. So I'll feel test that I'm taking it with me to

203
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,000
Tennery and, uh, I'll be taking pictures with it. Just took pictures of the prom dress. Of course,

204
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,240
I'll put those on the probably on curie.com or my flicker side so you can take a look at that.

205
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,720
I know let you know how it goes. But very impressed. I like it. Just, just the fact that it

206
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,520
looks really expensive is making me feel very good. Hey, Adam, it's Hishmal from Madrid here.

207
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,720
I've been a source code, at least aren't for nearly three years or so. A few DCs ago,

208
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,240
you mentioned that you didn't like a spanned at much. Well, I'm here to change that. Well,

209
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,240
I didn't say I didn't like Spain that much, but that we're going to Tennery from vacation. And of

210
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,400
course, the whole problem is I don't speak Spanish. Okay. I'm obviously fluent in English,

211
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,000
Dutch, which would, I guess, take me down to South Africa as well, besides the Netherlands and Belgium.

212
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,600
So that's all fine. Conversational German. I can get by in some French, but Spanish now.

213
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,760
It's really not my language. So I don't hate Spain or these Spanish. I feel incompetent because

214
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,280
I don't speak the language. I want to prepare you for your trip to Tennery thing. So you can have the best time

215
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,800
ever. I appreciate it. I will give you a brief introduction to our language. To simple things,

216
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,280
we'll make your time here much more pleasant. Okay. Okay. Let's go ahead. Don't they?

217
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:37,120
Style value. That means where are the restrooms? You'll agree with me. This is a very,

218
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,440
very important thing to know. Especially in some situations. All right, repeat with me. Okay.

219
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,840
Don't they? Style value? Don't they? Style value? Good job. All right. And don't they?

220
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,880
Style value? Which is quite important too. It would be asking.

221
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:03,920
What? That's something like give me some local wine. And believe me. Don't they? What?

222
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,320
That's quite important. All right. What is it again? I guess that's okay for now.

223
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,680
No, no, give it to me. Yeah. Which is quite important too. Let's do it.

224
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,440
Yes, can. Ponga un vinito de la casa.

225
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,240
What the hell was he saying? I can't understand you.

226
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,640
Conga le vinito de casa? Quite important too. Would be asking. Ponga un vinito de la casa.

227
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,400
Conga un vinito de casa. Okay. Something like give me some local wine. Yeah, that's good.

228
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,880
But I'd be looking for, I wouldn't be looking for the local wine. What is the word? I'm looking for

229
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,800
Yerba. Don't they? Yerba de casa? Can I have your local house? Grass, please?

230
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:57,680
Believe me. That's quite important. And okay. It's that's okay for now and you really don't need

231
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:06,240
that much else to get around here. Right, man. Enjoy your vacation. Of course. Yeah, folder.

232
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Yeah, total. Okay. Yo. Hey, man. I'm looking for something I can really use, you know,

233
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:21,920
for the Yerba. But that's what I'm looking for. You're go the slow mo. So this is a promo.

234
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:29,120
Oh, for my 200 show. That could really cook the radio. But sometimes no celebration.

235
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,400
Pop a smurf lady's in gentlemen. We are a fine strong race with a fine strong past.

236
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,320
But we face an uncertain and perilous future governed by new laws as the natural world yields

237
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:49,280
under the crushing weight of human footsteps. And we thought was true. Until we met soccer girl.

238
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:56,320
Are you prepared to endure all manners of unspeakable hardship? Yes. Yes, I am. I would do anything for soccer girl.

239
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,040
If there's one thing she's not a tampon or a defective bomb on a tomaton, a cap on a monkey,

240
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,280
stamps of Kentucky, trampoline hijinks. Oh, wait. She kind of is that.

241
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Soccer girls 200 the episode. Soccer girl incorporated.com. Soccer girl.com Friday April 13th.

242
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,000
Now, you better believe it, baby. I'm taking that with me on VK. I want to listen to that episode 200 of

243
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,920
Soccer Girl Incorporated. If you have not seen her most recent video show, which was two short

244
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:34,240
films. I think it was titled You Have to Watch It. It's that artistic, stunning, thought provoking,

245
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:44,080
political, awesome, fucking stuff. In fact, we showed that video in Los Angeles to a couple of

246
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,000
people. And they were just completely blown away by the talent that soccer girl was showing on that

247
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,800
very, very proud of what she's doing. What's it like listening the daily source code 580?

248
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:19,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

249
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:32,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Well, it's not that good, but it's pretty close.

250
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,480
Just want to fit that wedding as we closed out the satellite window with the serious listeners.

251
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,560
You know, I said something last, was it last week I think about, um, I'm a dinner jod,

252
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,320
the president of Iran about him deserving a Nobel Peace Prize. I just wanted to clarify one thing

253
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,920
there. I'm a dinner jod, of course, if you believe the reports is not a nice guy. He's a a tyrant.

254
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:07,200
He allegedly, I got to believe he did this just too much reporting on allegedly said that

255
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,840
thing of the Holocaust didn't exist and it is real should be wiped off the map. This, of course,

256
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:18,000
qualifies, qualifies him as a complete douchebag. I guess my only point was that considering the

257
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,240
history between Iran and the United Kingdom, and by the way, you know, total douchebags and dictators

258
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:31,840
and I don't know if you saw the last king of Scotland, if you looked at, uh, uh, EDA mean,

259
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,480
of course, that was a fictional piece of work, but, you know, loosely based on a true story,

260
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,360
you know, I think it is possible that even douchebags like this sometimes want to turn the

261
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,040
tide and maybe just maybe we could take into consideration that Ahmadinejad was trying to

262
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,800
change the relationship between coalition forces. Let's not forget that, uh, you know, there's

263
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,040
a lot of, a lot of push from the west saying, you know, fuck you Iran, we're going to come in

264
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,160
and kick your ass. You know, let's just be honest about it. And, uh, and there's a couple of

265
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:09,680
coalition soldiers, uh, whether they were in their territorial waters or not close enough, I'd say,

266
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,240
they were off the coast of England, whether they went territorial waters or not, I think people would

267
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:21,440
be paying attention to it, you know, and, uh, and so we let them go. Now, of course, the stories,

268
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,880
and boy, this is so controversial. Uh, here in the UK is that the, uh, the Ministry of Defense

269
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,960
allowed, uh, all of the, the 15 captured to sell their stories or to give their stories, but in some

270
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,680
cases, I'm pretty sure they're being sold, uh, to the press. And so, of course, the, the accounts

271
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:44,560
of, uh, of their time, there are quite harrowing and not at all, uh, um, in line with the, you know,

272
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:51,520
hey, they just hung out for a while and they were given back to the UK as a gift. Uh, so, you know what,

273
00:26:51,520 --> 00:27:00,000
it's just so freaking hard. I'll tell you, um, I have so little belief in, um, in mainstream media and

274
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,120
reporting. And it's really because every single time it's about me or something I really know about,

275
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,080
it's usually wrong, or at least there's something wrong. Here's a fine example. I met at a

276
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:18,400
party at a Christmas party, uh, the Mary Meeker, I think, who, um, in the heyday of the, uh, of the

277
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:25,120
dot com bubble was the analyst. Whatever she said, uh, was usually right and it was certainly, um,

278
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,560
defining for any company, uh, particularly public companies at the time. She wielded a tremendous amount

279
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,960
of power. Very interesting when we went very, very smart. I think she got into some trouble and

280
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,480
there was all kinds of crap, which probably, um, she was accused of things that weren't true, but

281
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,120
it probably stuck to her. So, uh, I think she's reinventing herself. But I met her. It was very nice.

282
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,480
And, uh, she said, you know, there's a book I want to send you. And I left it at the, at the condo.

283
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,560
It was about MTV. It was a, it's a brand new book. You know, I'm pissed off that I forgot the title of it.

284
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Let me just see if, uh, there's like the making of a revolution. I think was the title of it. Hold on.

285
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,520
Bear with me. Let's go to Amazon. Let's see if, uh, let's see if this stuff really does work.

286
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,000
If we can find something that we've only loosely heard about. So let me see,

287
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,080
we'll call it MTV revolution is what my search term will be. Let's search.

288
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,800
And I know what the cover looks up here. It is the making of a, uh, of a revolution by Tom McGrath. Okay.

289
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:44,640
Um, so here it is, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Whatever. So it's the making of a revolution.

290
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,880
MTV by Tom McGrath. And so here's Mary. She sent this to me. You know, saying, like, this is a pretty interesting history of, of MTV.

291
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,960
And of course, I know the history. Now, what do you do when you get a book like that? The first thing you do,

292
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:01,040
would you go all the way into the back into the appendix? And, uh, you look for your own name. So I see my

293
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:07,360
name list on, like page 165166. And, uh, unfortunately, I don't have it here with me as I already said.

294
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,400
But, you know, so here's this book that is supposed to be about the revolution. And then it, uh, it,

295
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,400
it says, okay, in, um, after the first original, uh, four VJs were replaced. And then it says,

296
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,680
I downtown Julie Brown from the UK and the handsome Australian Adam Curry. I'm like, what the fuck?

297
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:30,800
The handsome Australian Adam Curry. You know, so what else is wrong in the book? Do you see what

298
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,720
I get so frustrated about? They had the right year. They had the right timing. But then it's like the

299
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,800
handsome Australian. Now, I know they're confused with, uh, I believe Richard Wilkins, who, uh, came

300
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:47,200
in, uh, briefly for about five or six months after I'd been there for a year. But it just goes to show,

301
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,520
you know, so anyway, long circle round, whatever, I'm a data jot set or dud did, you know, screw them.

302
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,120
He's not a nice guy. But it could also be that he's trying to reach out. And I think that will be

303
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:08,960
worthy of some type of recognition. Uh, uh, let's see. What did I miss? Ah, yes. I missed it. I missed

304
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,240
being there. But I did hear parts of it. Uh, podcast New York. If you were in a podcast,

305
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,440
NYC this past weekend, you missed the largest free gathering of podcasters and podcasts listeners

306
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,840
you didn't get to meet Andrew Barron from Rocket Boom and see his crazy slides and

307
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,520
listen to his funny story. You miss John Havens talking about podcasting's real return on investment.

308
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,480
You missed me Howard Greenstein talk with the lovely Rachel Clark about using podcasts and video

309
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,760
cast as part of a larger social media strategy. You didn't get to see Chris Brogan co-founder of

310
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,200
podcast in a silly top hat in a cape or talk with Chris Penn from the financial aid podcast

311
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,200
about bum rush the charts. And you didn't meet any one of a number of huge

312
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,440
podsafe musicians and podcasters live, including Uncle Seth Natalie Gilman, David E. Polito

313
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,240
that guitar man from Central Park with Lisa from my love the company, Joe from Guy Girl in a

314
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:06,320
bottle, Chef Markin, the lovely Jennifer from Remarkable Palette and Food Philosophy,

315
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,520
you didn't hear Slaw discuss podsafe for Christmas or talk with soccer girl and brother love

316
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,160
at the same time and get one of those really special autographed soccer girl pictures you

317
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,400
know the ones with the oh wait that totally didn't happen. But worst of all you didn't hear the

318
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,840
podcamp organizers from three different cities talk about how you could run podcamp in your

319
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:32,480
town. But don't fear because almost all of these conversations are captured in podcasts and

320
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,280
video cast that will be available at the podcamp NYC dot org website either now or in the near future.

321
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,040

324
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:05,840
Thanks Howard. You know I did miss podcamp NYC however I ran across a recording I think it was

325
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:15,600
a session moderated or narrated or hosted by Chef Mark from the remarkable palette and it was

326
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:24,240
about GBLT podcasters and it was a fascinating discussion actually gave me an idea of something

327
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,720
that we can do with podshow.com which I don't want to tell you right now because Ron and I are still

328
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,120
working on it but it gave me some really good ideas and I was a little disappointed you know

329
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,480
they were talking about places to put your podcast and and tools that you can use and

330
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,360
social media networks and Richard Blusting of course very vocal in the in the GLB T said GBLT

331
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,960
GLB T don't like that. So make it easy GBLT because I can remember BLT

332
00:32:51,760 --> 00:33:00,000
GBLT. Anyway in that podcast community and he and it was at one point you know it's like

333
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,040
well you know there's another place you could put your podcast but I don't really want to say the

334
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,760
name because you know I work for him. Like fuck you and he people even said people even said

335
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,160
oh it's okay you can say the night he wouldn't say podshow and like he was embarrassed in fucking

336
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:24,160
embarrassed. Thanks dude. Thank you. Oh well. So in my ego filters which I of course won on

337
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:32,480
techno-radi and Google news etc. I came across a posting from my space, from my space page

338
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,360
and so here's the main it's actually it's a it's a podcast and the podcast I'm familiar with

339
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:46,640
the was it from the on the front porch podcast I believe it is and I saw my name in here

340
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,760
here it is from the show no's finally I'd love for Adam Curry the podfather reference in the vows

341
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,480
to bless our commitment ceremony. Tell them about this show tell them something like

342
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,760
baritone thirst and as a podcaster embossed and realized he had a major problem with pod fade.

343
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,920
He returned from pod camp NYC determined to make a men's with his listeners and held a

344
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,840
commitment ceremony in episode 26 he seeks the blessing of you the pod father and and then given my

345
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,560
side or something. All right so no one sent this to me but I did find it through the magic of the

346
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:24,480
internet but the fact is you haven't been able to count on me and that is a terrible, terrible

347
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,480
aspect of a relationship because it destroys trust and if you can't trust and I'm going to be there

348
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,000
next week or at least next month then we might as well call this whole little experiment called

349
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:44,000
the front porch podcast off right and I folks I'm not ready to do that I am not ready to give up on you

350
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:54,800
and I hope you are not ready to give up on me so I left pod camp NYC with a vow I felt that I was a

351
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,200
born again podcaster if you will and I saw this relationship that we had and I saw it was on the rocks

352
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,440
but I knew it wasn't too late it's never too late we got something good we had something good

353
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,840
we can bring that back so I want to renew my vows with you. So I really like this and I listened to

354
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:20,480
this whole thing where he just felt he wasn't doing enough he there was months that went by where

355
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:28,240
he didn't release an episode and he wanted to re what is it to restate his vows with his audience and

356
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,600
I'll play a little bit of it because it's really way too long I'll put a link in the show notes

357
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,520
of course so you can listen to the whole episode but I thought it was funny interesting we're going

358
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,640
to have a little podcast kind of touching at the same moment right here right now I brought in a

359
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:47,680
pastor check it out. I was actually asleep in Los Angeles while I was like drifting away while I was

360
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:54,480
listening to this and put me in a weird dream state. Daily beloved we are gathered together here

361
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:02,240
in the sign of the pod father and in the face of this company to join together this audio producer

362
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:10,560
and this listener in holy subscription which is commended to be honorable among all men and therefore

363
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,880
is not by any need to be entered into univisantly or lightly but reverently, discreetly,

364
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:24,320
advisedly and solemnly into this holy estate these two persons present now come to be joined.

365
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,720
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let them speak now

366
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:40,320
or forever hold their peace. Seeing as these remarks are pre-recorded I cannot acknowledge any objections

367
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:48,240
therefore let us continue. Subscription is the union of podcaster and listener in heart,

368
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:55,680
body and mind it is intended for the mutual joy and for the help and comfort given on another

369
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,920
and prosperity and adversity. You know I got to think about this a little bit more because there

370
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,560
is really something to this there's really something in here that I liked a lot about this bond

371
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,680
between listener and podcaster producer whatever you want to call yourself or audience member.

372
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,240
Again I have a listen to it it's really long it's like seven or eight minutes I'm not going to

373
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,640
play it now I got two more things I wanted to play for you coming up I have an exclusive

374
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,360
Pete Townsend unplugged and off the fucking hook you can love this song it's exclude it's not pod safe

375
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:33,840
unfortunately but we do have an exclusive on it for pod show I'll get to that in one moment.

376
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,960
Earlier in the week I played a piece that cypster DJ sent in from to me from from down

377
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,920
under and it was a snippet of a podcast with a senseo burp which was then called a podcast moment

378
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,320
and that we weren't quite sure of the language that it occurred in home see if I can find the exact

379
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,200
spot here still oh I'm a dickie and you know there's a very

380
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,560
yeah what gets the moment so it's like what language is that man is that Russian is it

381
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:09,120
well I got a lot of responses to that as you can imagine I add on this is John from Pennsylvania

382
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:19,360
that phone call you got with the podcast moment was not Italian it was finished I'm 90% sure

383
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,640
I checked with him this is my dad who's just don't end but I don't speak any of it anymore but

384
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,320
it's finished all right take care and have a good week and hope you have a great vacation bye

385
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,520

386
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,160
comic strip blogger said that it was of course you know he couldn't just say it was finished no he

387
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,000
had to say dude what an insult to say it was Russian because the Russians occupied Finn

388
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,760
hundred million years I'm so sorry I apologize finish see and I'm pretty sure those guys got

389
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,680
that whole the podcast moment I sure it it related back to the show I hope so

390
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,120
