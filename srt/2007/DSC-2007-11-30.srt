Dromatically reduce ambient noise by up to 85% with Sony's noise cancelling headphones

00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,560
and work home or travel, shut out the noise and really enjoy your tracks, get yours at

Sony.com slash headphones, Sony headphones, your music never sounded so good.

00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:03,480
I don't know if I'm gonna flip it up, but I'm going to blow it home.

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,760
I'm such a jerk of the band with the 70's penis, please come to the bar, because the band

episode number 694 last show for this week coming to you from the Curry condo in Northern

12
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,000
California. It's been a beautiful day today. It's been quite a busy week as you can imagine

13
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,320
of course. It's been the delayed, say, source code once again with only three shows pumped

14
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,000
out. I still not too bad considering the only two nights that I didn't do a show. Of course,

15
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,520
I'm doing them in the evening, which means it's still technically football Friday and Australia

16
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,800
by the time you guys are listening to this. The two nights I didn't make it as because I

17
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,800
went to bed at 9 o'clock 9.30. First night I slept until 6.30. That was perfect. And then

18
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,200
Wednesday night for Thursday show. I just got back from the office and I was like,

19
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,720
I'm sorry, not back from the office. No, no, no, no, no. There was Wednesday night for Thursday

20
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,160
show. That's right. I had dinner with Natalie Delcante. Oh, yes. And I was home at 9.30 and

21
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:18,640
one stretching bed alone. I wasn't so lucky though. I woke up at 4.30. So that was this morning.

22
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,320
It's just, it's been crazy. It really has. And of course, Friday, very special football Friday,

23
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:32,640
engineering. I think it's Kevin O and Pavel are probably Andrew Grummit. I don't know the whole

24
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,120
engineering team as far as I'm concerned. They're going to be presenting V3, V3 is the new version

25
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,240
of poncho.com, which now this is really an internal company presentation. So please don't get too excited.

26
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,120
It's not going to be until the end of January that we expect to have it up and running full and

27
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,600
it's in her full glory. But this has been months and months and months of work to get to this stage.

28
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,720
And it's, I know it's going to be spectacular. Maybe I'll sneak a screenshot or two just to mess

29
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,880
with everybody. Okay, let's start with an easy question for today's food war Friday.

30
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,600
Adam, you've to sell guy Germany. You. Adam, I'm standing in a traffic jam here. Just thinking

31
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,400
away. And I have a question. Do you need to get a separate private license for flying at night?

32
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,440
Or, you know, is it similar? Can you with one license, just fly at night or the flying at night

33
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:33,120
require a completely different skill sets? Just curious to know, big shout outs to Deep Mar of

34
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,560
Fork, my German colleague, who first got me to iPods broadcasting and all that other stuff. Bye.

35
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,200
All right. Thank you. Thank you. Well, that really depends where you get your license.

36
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
But at this point, it's been like six weeks since I've flown. I don't know if I can fly during the

37
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,360
day. I wonder, it's been, I mean, this is really one of the longest periods of gone without

38
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,680
flying. It's just been the schedule. It depends where you get your license. In the United States,

39
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,840
you have to do five hours of night flying for your private pilot's license.

40
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,760
So I did that for rotary, as well as for the helicopters, well as for fixed wing for regular

41
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:17,040
airplanes. I like night flying. I haven't done any solo. Well, yeah, I think I did two hours solo.

42
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,320
But you know, that's like doing circuits around the airfield. I haven't really done anything

43
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,280
across country any serious nighttime flying. Mainly because that's a lot better to do it in the

44
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,480
States. I would say in general, just considering the weather where we're where I live.

45
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,240
And in other countries, I think in the UK for the CAA license, it's an add-on.

46
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,880
You know, so it kind of depends where you get your license. Do you need a separate set of capabilities?

47
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,640
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. That's when I stopped wearing contact lenses. After I did

48
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,280
what my first night flight in the helicopter, and we landed at Antwerp Airport, and then we went back

49
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,720
to the the Curry Castle at the time, landing in the backyard. Then I took out my lenses, put on my

50
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,080
glasses, and I could not believe the difference. There was such a difference in just what I was

51
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,840
able to see, the sharpness. I was like, I never looked. I said, I'm not going to deprive myself

52
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,480
during the day by wearing, actually I did do that. When I had dinner with Natalie, I put in my

53
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,400
lightly blue colored contact lenses. Hey Adam, it's Callie from Geek Brief.

54
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,560
Oh, from one babe to the next. The question on the last DSC about Geek Brief being behind

55
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,560
on Tivo, so I just wanted to fill in the blanks. I've been talking to Potcho HQ about it. The

56
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,440
process is pretty labor and time intensive. On our part, it takes two extra hours to get an episode

57
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,840
Tivo ready and up to Potcho. Then someone at Potcho has to get it into the Tivo system.

58
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,760
Up until a few days ago, it was going through another process with a person at Tivo.

59
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,360
Now it's a little bit more streamlined, but we're still at the mercy of compression and uploads

60
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,520
the bane of my existence. I know you guys are working on it hard. We're working on it too,

61
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,760
and for Tivo cast viewers, I'm thinking it's just kind of a welcome to the joys of early adopted.

62
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,640
I miss you. Let me make it pictures. Did I talk too fast?

63
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,520
Oh, no. But you could send another comment and say that slow or semi-naked picture.

64
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,240
Welcome to the joys of early adopted. I miss you. Let me make it pictures.

65
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:18,000
Did I talk too fast? Yeah. I got like four different people sending the emails and comments

66
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,920
about this, about how, you know, I've got a comment. Was it last show on Boe Boe Boe, Wednesday show?

67
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,720
That the episode seemed to be behind on Tivo on the Tivo cast. And it is quite a process. I told

68
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,440
you, you know, we've got a, so Callie has to produce, you know, just as one of the shows,

69
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,400
we put as many shows on as possible. I think what we have going up there tonight,

70
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,880
Brian, no semi-neme, I'm about it. Anyway, I'll look for that in a second.

71
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,520
So in the case of Geek Brief, Callie Neal have to produce a, you know, a certain format that works

72
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,240
on television. So it really looks nice on television. That of course also has to be uploaded.

73
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,080
Then I think it goes to Brian, Brian then has to transcode or fruco-romos it.

74
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,640
After he puts in like the, I don't know, the leaders and the PG-14s and all kinds of stuff that

75
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,600
has to go in the Tivo. And indeed, there was another person at Tivo, actually had a part of his work

76
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,640
in the process. I think that's no automated. We're getting better. We're getting there.

77
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,520
But man, being a media company is hard work, isn't it?

78
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,240
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Games Weasel. On this week's show, we've got a review of Super Mario

79
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,360
Galaxy on the Wii. We've also got a little review of the game on the PSP called Deadhead Fred.

80
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,640
We chat to Jerry Seinfeld about his new B movie game and you can win copies of Unreal Tournament 3

81
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,400
for the PC. Check it out at gamesweasel.btpodshow.com.

82
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,440
Really?

83
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,120
Chat with Jerry Seinfeld. Interesting, Mr. Matt Cuddle.

84
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,200
nominated for a gaming media award, or those, have those already passed and did you not win?

85
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,760
I still like the show, like the video version too.

86
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,080
So it's almost hit test number 100. Hit test number 98 to be exact.

87
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,120
And Yon sent me a peculiar email. He said, Adam, here's the hit test number 99,

88
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,480
number 98 for the football Friday. And here is a video version.

89
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,760
So I'm going to play the video. I have no idea what I'm going to be seeing. I'm going to play the video

90
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,360
version and you guys just listen along to it. Because it is part of the Friday festivities.

91
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,280
I see. It's Yon in the studio.

92
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,920
Hey Yon, this is hit test number 98 and this is a special edition.

93
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,320
You look pretty. And let's see if you figure it out. This says intro number one. Hit me.

94
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,600
So, Chris Ria, come on. And it's like one of my favorite songs.

95
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,880
Easy. Yon, you look so interesting from this angle. Number two.

96
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,760
Isn't that Chris, Chris Ria as well? Isn't that Josephine or on the beach?

97
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,440
And this week's final one is number three.

98
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,360
That's on the beach. Oh, it's a Chris Ria special. Okay. So I think it was number one.

99
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,160
Was full of you think it's over. Then it was Josephine and on the beach.

100
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,840
Times up and these are the answers. Okay, hit me. Oh, and by now you can figure out that this is a special Chris Ria

101
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,880
edition of the hit test. This is an number one from 1978. Cool. If you think it's over.

102
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:05,760
Five, four, if you think it's over, let's just figure it out. Oh, Yon's number one.

103
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,960
Fool, if you think it's over. Yeah. And this is answer number two.

104
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,280
From 1985. This is Josephine. Straight. Straight on my window.

105
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,760
I know the lyrics. Thank you.

106
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,720
I send you all my love, Josephine.

107
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,320
Answer number two, Josephine. And this is answer number three from 1986.

108
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Also, Chris Ria. This is on the beach.

109
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:05,440
Texting by, to the place, on the beach.

110
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,920
Answer number three on the beach. In this special Chris Ria edition of the hit test.

111
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,240
And it's number 98. So I think did you have them all? Every single one my friend.

112
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,920
So yeah, answers to this hit test. And also the links to iTunes. You can buy these

113
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,920
strikes online. Can be found at hitthest.potshow.com.

114
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,640
So I don't thank you for playing everyone else. Thank you for listening.

115
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,320
And I'll be back next week for number 99. So until then, take care and bye bye.

116
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:58,240
Oh, I wish you guys could have seen the video version of that. That was absolutely spectacular.

117
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,600
I'm sure young is going to post that at hittest.potshow.com or at what is it?

118
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,040
Yumpulet.com. Why is it so soft?

119
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,080
Oh, that sucks. I was going to be really slick and I was going to play that song for you.

120
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,920
All right, let me maybe if I try, uh, I'm using a new search function we have on on pod show on a sec.

121
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,440
I can't make it any louder than that. That's kind of weird.

122
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,920
Well, that's it. Something in the, no, it's not the connections.

123
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,160
How amateurish is this? Why it feels like a proper food bar Friday?

124
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,800
Oh, I'll see if this is louder. Why is it so soft? Is it something with the,

125
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,400
must be something with the volume control fucking windows, man.

126
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,320
Okay, here we go. It's over here. I found it.

127
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,320
I think I just have to play the song for a second.

128
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
We come back.

129
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,960
I just do one chorus together. Okay.

130
00:15:38,160 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh, of course he heard me promoting the Sony headphones.

131
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,560
The new Bluetooth wireless Sony headphones, which apparently are completely awesome.

132
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,040
And you're concerned with sound listening. Your comment is pretty interesting.

133
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,520
I've heard about the new Bluetooth sound that should come in the 2000s, so I'm just curious.

134
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,960
But probably we can't Bluetooth headphones, but they use compression to get the sound into your ears.

135
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,960
And that's especially about with the already compressed sound.

136
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:44,400
So just curious to know if you know and tell your, or just to google pod breeze and of course,

137
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
follow up hell that they are the curry.

138
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,120
I think that was something nasty and Swedish.

139
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,160
You know, that's a very good point. I don't know what the Bluetooth standard is.

140
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,200
I'm not up to speed on that. I had no idea that there's like, you know, some kind of compression

141
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,520
issue or transmission issue and makes it sound crappy. I'd love to have more info on that.

142
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,320
I've refueling comic strip blogger might know.

143
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,840
Oh, man. It's going to be one of those shows. Let's try it again.

144
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah. Oh, how's it going? Adam, it's Jersey Todd, the official musicologist of the

145
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,920
Chacha. Dude, now that I've been the musicologist for a while now,

146
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,200
I feel like it's my obligation to keep my eyes out for some bands that I really want to get up on the

147
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,960
music network. And this week, the band is no exception. The band is semi-precious weapons at

148
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,160
a New York City and I've heard about these guys for a long time. And while they're finally

149
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,040
up on the podcast music network and the weight has been worth it. Check this song out.

150
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,600
It's probably got the best lyric of the year. I can't pay my rent, but I'm fucking gorgeous.

151
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
How great is this stuff? Check it out.

152
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:39,760
I can't pay my rent, but I'm fucking gorgeous.

153
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,800
I got that song that can kill your comrades.

154
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,600
If you want to try, you better come inside.

155
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,680
You can't pay my rent, but I'm fucking gorgeous.

156
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:15,920
Tell me something I don't know. Tell me something I don't know.

157
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,600
Tell me something I don't know.

158
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,720
I can't get to, can't get to um tutor.

159
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,480
I don't strangle, it's my heart is closed to the moment.

160
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,920
I can't let the fucus check thetes less and less

161
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:50,920
I know y'all want to be my

162
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,920
But baby, I ain't sick

163
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Don't drag me

164
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,920
It's because my heart is closed

165
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Oh

166
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Tell me something I don't know

167
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,920
Tell me something I don't know

168
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Tell me something I don't know

169
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Tell me something I don't know

170
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,920
If you can't, if you can't, if you can't

171
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
I can't, if you can't

172
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Tell me something I don't know

173
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Tell me something I don't know

174
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Tell me something I don't know

175
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Tell me something I don't know

176
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,920
If I could clear the guitar, it would sound like that

177
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Does any freshness weapons?

178
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
Tell me something I don't know

179
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,920
I can't pay the rent, but I'm fucking gorgeous

180
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,920
Thank you so much, Jersey Todd

181
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Fantastic selection for the footballer today

182
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Hi Adam, it's John here from Guilford

183
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,920
I don't know if you have any funny sound for Cisco

184
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,920
I've got a question regarding polisher channels

185
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,920
I emailed support, but didn't get him head back from them

186
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Here's a question

187
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,920
I've got a load of channels, and I'm subscribed to podcast

188
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,920
And so by iTunes, I've just come home tonight, and I'm sitting here

189
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,920
And I'm clicking refresh refresh refresh

190
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,920
I know you've already released the SD-693, but I don't see it

191
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
I'm still clicking refresh nothing

192
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,920
So then I go to podshow.com, I go to my profile page

193
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,920
I go back to iTunes, click refresh

194
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:05,920
And right now I've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 podcasts downloading

195
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,920
So I choose to check every hour, I don't get them every hour

196
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
So what's up with that?

197
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Let me know, because I mean, it's a kind of defeat support

198
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Using channels, but I don't get my content when I want it

199
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Cheers man, what must I say?

200
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,920
Yeah, yeah, I'm curry, bolder, red pan

201
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,920
I haven't got color, clearly what color pillar I am

202
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
It's nice, it's nice

203
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Cheers mate, yeah, lots of people had this problem

204
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,920
It was very sporadic, so let me see if I can explain it to you

205
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,920
It should be fixed by now, it did take us many days actually

206
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Because we had the thanksgiving holiday

207
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,920
And had like three or four guys jump it on this

208
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Trying to figure it out, here's essentially what happened

209
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
So there's a couple of processes

210
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,920
Obviously there's a huge aggregator that goes out

211
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,920
And looks at all the shows that you're subscribed to

212
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,920
And it gets album art and does all kinds of stuff for you

213
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,920
To bring it into either your collection or into your channels

214
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Then there's another process which updates the channels

215
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Because these also all have to be checked

216
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
And you can imagine there's quite a few

217
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,920
So this is a couple of machines that do this work

218
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,920
I think I just dedicated to this work

219
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,920
So there was an update to some of the code base

220
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Not quite sure what exactly

221
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,920
An update meaning like some software is upgraded

222
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Whatever happened, these processes weren't started again

223
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,920
It's part of the normal, I guess the servers were rebooted or whatever

224
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,920
And so these processes didn't start or weren't started

225
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
It doesn't really matter

226
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
So the channels weren't updating

227
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,920
However the channels are engineered

228
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,920
That if you go look at your channels and you click on a channel

229
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Then it's automatically going to update

230
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
The minute you hit that page, it doesn't update

231
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,920
So if the update script hasn't hit your channel yet

232
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,920
And it's not just one, it's a whole bunch of these things

233
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,920
If it hasn't hit your channel yet, then the minute you go look at your channels

234
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,920
It automatically does that so that you'll have an enjoyable experience

235
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
With the freshest content, the minute you click play

236
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,920
So I guess I don't know what the interval is

237
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
But it's not a long time

238
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,920
But since the update process has not been running for

239
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Apparently several days

240
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
And it was very hard to troubleshoot

241
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Because I, for instance, wasn't seeing it

242
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,920
Logically because I am always hitting my page, listening to stuff

243
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Looking at what's coming up in my channels

244
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,920
So stuff that was loading onto the

245
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,920
Any 110, it was showing up because I just refresh my channel

246
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,920
But anyway, they move some more hardware in

247
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,920
They start up some extra versions of this process

248
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
That has to run through everything

249
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
And I believe all channels now up to date

250
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
And we're all caught up

251
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
Apologies for that

252
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,920
Just all part of the food bar

253
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
I added some from Bristol and UK

254
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,920
I'm listening to DSC 693

255
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
And it's about the iPhone and the reception

256
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,920
I have one theory, the frequency

257
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,920
That's used for GFM in the United States

258
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Well, I was like, this is about the new story that the iPods

259
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
iPhones have poor reception in the UK

260
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,920
And my theory is that they had poor reception in the US too

261
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
But there's just less cell towers in the UK

262
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Or more

263
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
No, I think in general, I've seen it

264
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,920
I saw it with my own iPhone

265
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,920
And it was the same carrier

266
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,920
It wasn't O2, but I saw it on Vodafone

267
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,920
I saw it on orange, I saw it on a couple different networks

268
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
I would put my SIM card in the E61

269
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,920
I would get three or four bars

270
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,920
I put it in the iPhone, I would get no connection

271
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,920
whatsoever, or would come in and out

272
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Very briefly

273
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,920
So that's what this is about

274
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
It's another theory apparently

275
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,920
In the UK, we have two networks at 900 megahertz

276
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Which is O2 in Vodafone

277
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
And then orange in T-Mobile

278
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
He's 1800 megahertz

279
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,920
So the main O2 frequency in the UK

280
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,920
It's going to be a lot different to the US frequency for AT&T

281
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,920
So although the iPhone is triple band

282
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Or maybe it just doesn't work

283
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
So well, at the lower frequencies

284
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,920
That would also work if you're plugging it into the dock

285
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,920
Because when you plug it into the dock

286
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,920
You'll be giving it a bigger bit of metal

287
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
Therefore, making it antenna bigger

288
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,920
And the lower the frequency, the bigger the antenna should be

289
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Right

290
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
That's true

291
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Maybe there's a theory that

292
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
Anyway, love the show

293
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Thanks a lot

294
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
Yeah, man, thanks

295
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
No, I think you're right

296
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,920
That is true

297
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
What I can recall, because I did a lot with the

298
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,920
With illegal transmitters and ham radios

299
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Sideband

300
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
12 watts, PEP, blast and out

301
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,920
On the high jack upper channels

302
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,920
Anyone remember that?

303
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,920
You cut the diode leading to the chip

304
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,920
And all of a sudden, instead of 240 channels

305
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,920
You had, no, instead of 120 channels

306
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,920
You had 240 channels, because you had like this whole upper limit

307
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Near the near the 10 meter band

308
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
God, I'm going back in time

309
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
Is a geek R9

310
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Yeah, so if the lower the frequency

311
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
The bigger the antenna

312
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Interesting theory

313
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,920
That really could be something to that for sure

314
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Adam is a woman

315
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Hey, Robin

316
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Want to call and say, let's start talking predictions for 2008

317
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
I know it's early, but I'm starting early

318
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
All right

319
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
Okay

320
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
You're of the killer app

321
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,920
No, I want to talk about the killer device

322
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,920
I thought the apple iPhone was going to be that device

323
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Which can get podcasts on it

324
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,920
And I can't download

325
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
You can

326
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
Oh, okay

327
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Get it on your device

328
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
So that's me

329
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,920
There's not satisfying my needs for podcasts

330
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
I know there's podcasts

331
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
Ready, I know there's my potter

332
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,920
I know there's our tools

333
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,920
But I still haven't seen the device

334
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
And they did the Nokia

335
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
And I'd like to know more about what you talked about

336
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
When you're over there

337
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,920
And I hope it's not just about advertising for their device

338
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,920
But actually, if I'm giving them some input on what you would like to see

339
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
And what I would like to see

340
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,920
Oh, no man, it was all about benefit and money for pod show

341
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
There was nothing else

342
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,920
You think I'm going over there going to tell those guys something?

343
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Nah, I'm just there to benefit

344
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,920
Robin Robin Robin, I don't know if it's the device man

345
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
I don't think it's the device

346
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,920
And by the way, it's always platform and content

347
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
The two always have to go hand in hand

348
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,920
First of all, my prediction about record companies

349
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,920
There was a great article, I will great

350
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Not so great if you're time Warner

351
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,920
How they came in short

352
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
Lower profits

353
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,920
They don't get like five million dollars in profit for the quarter

354
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
I don't know if I was misleading that

355
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
But that was like, huh?

356
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,920
And that's on revenues of, you know, 700 million

357
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,920
It's kind of interesting

358
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
I'm not quite sure what's going on

359
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,920
But it seems like people are panicking in the traditional music business

360
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,920
And I'm not happy that they're...

361
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,920
Well, no, I guess I am kind of happy they're folding

362
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,920
But you know, it'll be interesting to see what's next

363
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,920
And what the fallout's going to be and how it's going to work

364
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,920
And are we at the nexus or we at the change?

365
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,920
Now when it comes to the killer app, I don't know

366
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
I think it's the networks man

367
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,920
There's a lot happening in mobile data

368
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,920
There's a lot of new frequencies coming up

369
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,920
The next five years will be interesting to watch

370
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,920
I don't think it's going to be anything happening in 2008

371
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,920
If you don't mind, I want to focus on getting ourselves a better president in 2008

372
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,920
He's killer device, obviously going to be the cell phone

373
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,920
And it's going to suck the big pipe and pull in all these podcasts over the ether

374
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Right to the cell phone device

375
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,920
But right now, you've got to take the Apple iTunes or the iPhone

376
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,920
And plug it in to get any podcasts

377
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
Now I can understand AT&T saying

378
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,920
He goes on for another minute, Rob and I'm sorry

379
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,920
I hear your frustration, bro

380
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
I really do

381
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,920
And so the Nokia and 810 is that something for you

382
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
I don't know

383
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,920
For me, it is perfect

384
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
I use it as an iPod

385
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Because it's small enough to fit into either my back pocket or my coat pocket

386
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,920
Even my inside pocket, it's a little on the heavy side

387
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,920
It's not an iPod by any means

388
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,920
But the media player

389
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
They've done something really good in the software

390
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
The media player is much more functional than it was

391
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
You can kind of create playlists

392
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,920
And there's an automatic playlists for recently added

393
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,920
So if you just load up a few files

394
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
You know, to take with you

395
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,920
And the way I do it is, you know, I just go to the dashboard

396
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Because that all works now, all this flash stuff works

397
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
And you know, click on the shows that I want

398
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,920
And I click on download and I download them to the device

399
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,920
And I'm off and running

400
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
And it does multiple downloads really well

401
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,920
That's really improved this thing

402
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
And as you know, as you know

403
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
And it's a little too late for me to call

404
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Chief Mega Head Sales Weasel Chris Jacob

405
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,920
We're going to be offering these to

406
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,920
Potual audience members at a great discount

407
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,920
And he assures me it's going to happen before

408
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
The end of the Christmas shopping season

409
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
It's going to be tight

410
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
But it's going to be in time

411
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Now, of course, if you can't wait

412
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
A couple of you have already done that

413
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
They are available now

414
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
And there's a link at

415
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Create.com and in the show notes at daily source code.com

416
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,920
When you can go and pick yourself one out

417
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,920
But it will be who view it in price

418
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
To wait a little bit

419
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,920
Adam Curry, this is Tom Wiley from Ireland

420
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,920
I'm just wondering about this any under any 10

421
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,920
The reason you guys are going to be doing

422
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,920
Is this going to be worldwide or just

423
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
U.S.

424
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,920
Because I am so pissed off with podcasts

425
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,920
But I'm just U.S.

426
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
What?

427
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
Oh, U.S. deals

428
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
Thank you

429
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
You're not the only one

430
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Wondering that

431
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,920
I've been assured it is for Europe

432
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,920
And the United Kingdom

433
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
And for the United States

434
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:17,920
And of course, anyone, I believe anyone can purchase it

435
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
Worldwide

436
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,920
But they did have to come up with

437
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,920
Separate promo codes and coupons

438
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
And so I know that there's work going on with that

439
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,920
That's basically our waiting for

440
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
So that we could do

441
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Territories outside the U.S.

442
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,920
So the answer is yes

443
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
And of course, I have no idea about price point

444
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Although anything these days

445
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
You buy so much with your English pound

446
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,920
It's just amazing, isn't it?

447
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Yeah, I'm a vapor here in San Diego, California

448
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,920
I was listening to DSC 69

449
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
Three I believe

450
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,920
And I've been appreciating with you sign off

451
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,920
That everybody's been giving you

452
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
I'm kind of curious for those of us

453
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
And I might have missed it

454
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,920
Because I've been listening for a couple of years

455
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
But I skipped out for a while

456
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
Coming back

457
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,920
You could explain the origin of the

458
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
Fuck you Adam Curry

459
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,920
But in any case until I get an explanation

460
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,920
Fuck you, ask Terry

461
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Yeah, it started with comic strip blogger

462
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Our European Union correspondent

463
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
He always end his reports

464
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,920
His official political reports

465
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,920
And other comments with your Fuck you Adam Curry

466
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,920
And I noticed

467
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Because I think I said, hey, you know

468
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,920
Everyone should just end their comments

469
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,920
With a good old FU Adam Curry

470
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,920
And I noticed that the comment

471
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Quality has gone up significantly

472
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
That's why I don't really want to stop it

473
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Because I can hear everyone's really focusing

474
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
on what they want to say

475
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
And they're getting the message out

476
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
And you guys are doing great on time

477
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
It's in reasonable

478
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
It's not like five minute comments

479
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,920
That are useless to me

480
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Because you know at the end

481
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
You're going to be able to say

482
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Fuck you Adam Curry

483
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,920
I feel free to use your creativity

484
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Come up with something else

485
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Okay, my name

486
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,920
Stumble across this

I'm going to listen to what I'm going to sound

594
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:20,720
The American Anthem's real thing from the Podsafe music network haven't uploaded a new song

595
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,680
and almost looks like two years, man, what happened to it?

596
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,520
Well, if there's still out there, just a thought, you could always enter in the audio

597
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,800
street.net competition, the battle of the bands at the grand opening of the new Hard Rock

598
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:42,480
Hotel on San Diego, go to audiostreet.net to enter for the battle of the bands, the winner.

599
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,760
I guess there's a big grand opening and then you get to perform on stage with Black Eyed Peas.

600
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,000
I guess you'll be opening act for them, which ain't too shabby.

601
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:02,160
Last night, I went to bed and I couldn't sleep immediately, I was really early and so first

602
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:09,780
I listened to traces of nuts from the UK side of the equation, BT Podsha, traces of nuts.bt

603
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:14,880
Podsha.com, those guys are fucking crazy, that's really, really funny episode.

604
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,680
And then I listened to Pacific Coast Hellway, Mark had Mike UC on, that's a great combination

605
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
of those two guys.

606
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:30,800
And I was literally giggling in bed, it was so juvenile, yet so delicious.

607
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,840
Hey Adam, Anning Booker from Leipzig, Germany here, I'm a long time listener since

608
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:43,320
2005, I think, and I have a comment on DSC693.com, they're coming straight blogger talked

609
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:50,160
about the beginning of World War II and he was kind of right, but as a student of history

610
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,800
advanced class in Germany, I can't help myself.

611
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,920
Oh, hold on a second, I think we're going to get a little bit of a history lesson about

612
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:02,320
the beginnings of World War II pay attention, because this is the shit you'd never

613
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
learned in school.

614
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:10,080
To give you a more detailed overview, but the situation in Europe in this time in 1939,

615
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,520
so there was this problem with East Prussia or Ospreysen, and a deep Germany had

616
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,000
great interest in building a highway or Autobahn from the main part of Germany to East

617
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,040
of Prussia, mainly because it wasn't that easy to feed those people in this part of

618
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,480
Germany and to provide for them.

619
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,960
So this was one of the biggest issues between Poland and Germany in this time, but it wasn't

620
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,480
actually the trigger of World War II.

621
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,600
As you may know, World War II started in the morning hours of September 1st, 1939.

622
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,960
I have to be honest, I was never taught that in school either.

623
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,120
I did not know it was on September 1st, 1939, but I will remember from now on as will

624
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:56,920
have thousands of people listening to this World War II started on September 1st, 1939.

625
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:03,080
And actually it was a pretty nasty strike by German propaganda, because they claimed the

626
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:09,040
German propaganda claimed that Polish troops would have attacked a small German radio station,

627
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
called Zendagläwitz.

628
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,400
Of course, there weren't any military actions taking place from the side of Poland.

629
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,040
So here's what really happened.

630
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:25,080
A high Nazi officer ordered a task force to kill several Polish people, then to put them

631
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:31,120
into Polish uniforms and to let the scene look like an attack by the Polish on this radio

632
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,120
station, on the Zendagläwitz.

633
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:38,360
So it wasn't, actually it wasn't an attack by the Polish, but by German soldiers, but

634
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,720
it looked like an attack by the Polish.

635
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:54,800
Okay, so it was a cowardly attack dressed up as enemy terrorists, a page book from history,

636
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,000
interesting indeed.

637
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,160
And then in the propaganda Hitler told the German people that actually Germany was only

638
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,760
defending itself.

639
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:10,160
Then the Bermacht, the German armed forces invaded Poland, and this caused the declaration

640
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,520
of war by the United Kingdom and France, because they had both an alliance with Poland.

641
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:23,840
So this was the long version, the detailed version of the beginning of World War II, the

642
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:29,120
story behind this, the Zendagläwitz.

643
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,360
So I hope I could help you in a way, and yeah, fuck you, Adam Cole.

644
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
Oh yes, nice.

645
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
Okay.

646
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
Yeah, thank you.

647
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,040
That was, well that was actually quite educational, who says you can't learn something

648
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,040
from this.

649
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,560
Hey Adam, it's Andy from Germany.

650
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,560
Andy.

651
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,760
Do you really want to make me believe you couldn't resist the smuggler-tyzing?

652
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
Smuggler-tyzing.

653
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,760
Come on.

654
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,760
You know how they manipulate you.

655
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,160
The advertising is inside the cigarette and gets inside your brain.

656
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
Oh no.

657
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,720
You can't resist it.

658
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,160
I mean, if you really want to, you can't stop.

659
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
Okay, how?

660
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:11,160
And I want you to listen to my voice, just relax and listen to my voice.

661
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Can I touch myself?

662
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:22,680
I know you're safe when you see the fireworks, you will stop smoking forever, only the

663
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,680
splits are allowed.

664
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,960
I hope thank goodness.

665
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,800
And if it makes you go nuts, just tell us on the Charlie and we will call you and help

666
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,160
you to get through it.

667
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
Okay.

668
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
And remember one thing.

669
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
Here it comes.

670
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,360
Fuck you, Adam Cole.

671
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,360
Bye.

672
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:45,280
I take it all back.

673
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
You guys are just doing it to make me happy.

674
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,080
Hey, I know it's Gary Alexander from Las Vegas, it's going on.

675
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:57,880
I want to talk about the Republican debate on C, I think I saw on CNN or something as

676
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,040
I call it on the 100 channels.

677
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,040
Here we go.

678
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,480
There's someone talk about that a little bit and talk about Ron Paul and Giuliani.

679
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,760
Actually, actually John McCain seemed extremely frustrated in the debate.

680
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,320
I don't know if you were able to see it or not.

681
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320
I think.

682
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,280
Yeah, you know, actually I was able to see it because I have, we have a, a TV at the

683
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,280
office.

684
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,280
This is pretty cool actually.

685
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,640
We have a TV set up with a sling box and it's set up so that, you know, a number of

686
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,080
us could, you know, check if the TV cast is working via remote.

687
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,680
I don't have the capability to have a TV in the UK.

688
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,960
So I could actually literally sit in my office and I can switch through, you know, hundreds

689
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,760
of, you know, up in the attic in the manner.

690
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,000
I can switch through hundreds of channels and I can look at, you know, the TV cast version

691
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,640
of the stuff that's going up.

692
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,840
So I just switched to CNN and I just thought of my desk, you know, had a little window

693
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,840
running.

694
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
Yeah.

695
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
And also I was able to follow most of it.

696
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,240
It was, you know, I read some of the reports and I was like, you know, lots of fire

697
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,840
and I thought it was kind of tame.

698
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,320
I'm, you know, honestly, I'm sick and tired of this format.

699
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,400
And I, and yeah, the YouTube videos are very cute and people do very creative stuff.

700
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:11,320
But it's show business, you know, you know, a politics of show business for ugly people.

701
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,040
You can't, you can't like try to make show business out of show business.

702
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,400
You know, we need some politics.

703
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,600
We need some real debate, some real disc, people talk, you know, do a whole bunch of

704
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,760
sit down interviews and fill your channel with that.

705
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,400
We need some real information.

706
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,920
This is all just sound bites and trying to make other guys look bad and get a laugh.

707
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,720
And I said, what was I watching?

708
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,960
What's maybe it was, uh, CNN later that evening, I can't remember or this morning.

709
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,280
I don't know what when I saw it.

710
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,840
They had a panel of people sit there with a kind of like a vibeometer, you know,

711
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,880
and if they liked what they were seeing or hearing, then they would, you know,

712
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,160
I apparently push a lever up or move a slider up or whatever.

713
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,840
And you could catch their mood.

714
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,920
I've seen this experiment done.

715
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,200
We've done versions of it, Ron and I in our previous companies for research, you know,

716
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,440
you sit behind the glass wall and watch how people react to stuff, uh, the, the one,

717
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,320
the one way mirror.

718
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,200
That was always fun.

719
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,760
And, you know, and you see people just, you know, it's the laughs.

720
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,520
It's, uh, it's a comedic fest.

721
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,640
So I just don't think it's, it's good show business entertaining to watch,

722
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,000
but just didn't really do anything for me politically.

723
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,440
Maybe you're a sense of this semester, but, um, I tell you, Ron Paul, man.

724
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,080
I'm, uh, I'm just kind of blown away.

725
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,440
The guy is, uh, the little guys, you have some calmness, you know,

726
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,400
and, um, Juliani, I'm, I'm really torn between this Republican party.

727
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,320
I got to be honest with you, the Democratic party kind of sucks at this point,

728
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:53,160
as far as what they're offering, um, I'm not really one over by Obama or Clinton,

729
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,720
uh, or any of the other, uh, people for that matter of Democratic candidates.

730
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,120
But Ron Paul is really kind of, uh, spark my interest over and over.

731
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:08,200
So I want to thank you for bringing him to light and, uh, spark my interest in the debates in general,

732
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,600
because without, you know, having the Ron Paul stuff on here,

733
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,000
I really wouldn't have watched, to be honest with you, uh, this early on.

734
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,760
So thank you very much, and, uh, keep doing the dude.

735
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,360
Yo, man.

736
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah, thanks for calling it about that, because I, uh, you know, I'm glad,

737
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,640
because you reminded me, uh, to talk about it.

738
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:34,120
I didn't think Ron Paul was, uh, was really strong last night, um, um,

739
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,480
some of the messaging, I think needs to change a little bit.

740
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,880
Just, you know, my, my personal, you know, my, my personal opinion.

741
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,720
Uh, he also got less airtime, uh, than a lot of the other candidates, which is always typical with stuff like this.

742
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:53,320
Uh, Huckabee stealing a little bit of his thunder, Huckabee, you know, kind of cool with Chuck Norris, cool, good idea.

743
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,920
You know, Ron Paul could use some of that, some celebrity, you know, maybe Hasselhoff,

744
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,680
just a thought there. Hasselhoff would do it, for sure.

745
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:10,200
And, I mean, you, I mean, you, I mean, in all honesty, who wins, you know, Chuck Norris or the Huff?

746
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,400
I mean, that's, it's a tough one, but I think the Huff might have the upper hand.

747
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,320
He's a survivor, you know, he's been to Helen back again, the Huff.

748
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:27,320
And, uh, good old Doug Pilgrim sent me an email on Mom, see if I can find it here in my, uh, Google Notepad.

749
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,720
He, uh, maybe it didn't say for some reason.

750
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:39,480
Well, he sent me a, a perfect inventory of the, uh, of the primary, and he said, you know, January 8th,

751
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,720
here's the hotel, you should stay at, you know, here's the, the universities you could go to.

752
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:50,280
And I'm thinking, what can we do, you know, to rally, I guess, young people, college kids probably

753
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:56,120
is the best market, and is that the best market? What can we do to rally them, you know, a day or two before

754
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,200
the actual primary to get them to go and vote and have them vote for Ron Paul?

755
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,040
You know, I was thinking maybe some kind of campaign like, uh, take the red pill, vote for Ron Paul,

756
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:11,160
which I thought might actually be kind of a cool slogan because, you know, anyone who's seen the matrix

757
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,040
immediately understands the take the red pill, which, of course, is why I use it here on the daily

758
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:21,240
source code. Um, and I, and I know that it will work because I sent an email to, uh, to Ray Lane,

759
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,520
uh, to the Clienter Perkins, one of our investors, and, uh, somewhere there was a reference to the

760
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:32,600
to red pill, doesn't matter, you know, why, but there was a reference in the email thread, and, uh,

761
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,000
and he, he got it immediately and he, he dug it too. I'm thinking maybe we can do something like that,

762
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:46,120
take the red pill, vote for Ron Paul. Yeah, that's, that has a ring to it. Take the red pill, vote for Ron Paul.

763
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:54,760
December 16th will be, uh, the second money bomb for Ron Paul, it'll be, uh, the, the, the Boston Tea Party.

764
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,600
And a verse over the Boston Tea Party, you're gonna go raise some more money. I can't

765
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:04,680
donate anymore. I gave my maximum 2300 bucks, um, which I was wondering, I'm wondering now,

766
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,000
maybe I should have split that up. I'm sure this is going to be another drive. But anyway,

767
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,880
I can certainly, uh, paint Ron Paul out to you guys and, uh, you know, I think, I think he is the right guy

768
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:22,840
for the job. I really do, and I'm surprised that I'm, you know, backing a Republican. I never really

769
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:30,840
expected that to happen, not, not this, naturally, not this easily. Okay, uh, so we're going into the

770
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,280
weekend, you know, I've been trying to get into the kid into the Christmas spirit. It's, that's a

771
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,200
little weird in San Francisco, although it must say Union Square. They've done it up beautifully,

772
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:43,480
the tree is fantastic. There's lots of really nice decorations. Uh, but, you know, I like, you know,

773
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,840
having a fire going and that snow or, you know, I like the kind of the cold weather, uh, you know,

774
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,720
for a limited amount of time, obviously. And of course, I don't mind having a nice crisp, cold winter day

775
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,640
with the sun shining with a, you know, completely blue sky, perfect weather for flying, by the way.

776
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,120
So, kind of I want to get you in the mood, and, uh, it is a footballer Friday, so I'm, you know,

777
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,160
I always put some extra work in the looking for the tracks for you, and I found one by DJBC. It's a

778
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:14,680
mashup. Oh, this is John speaking with his voice. But all very happy to be able to talk to you like this

779
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,560
on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of the really game for us on

780
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:24,600
it's all due to you. I think you're like it. Imagine saying,

781
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:56,440
I'm a girl's coming at the wall, yeah, saying, I'm a girl's coming at the top, saying,

782
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:03,720
I'm a girl's coming at the top, saying, I'm a girl's coming at the top, saying,

783
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:08,360
I'm a girl's coming at the top, saying, I'm a girl's coming at the top, saying,

784
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:13,080
I'm a girl's coming at the top, saying, I'm a girl's coming at the top, saying,

785
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:25,480
I'm a girl's coming at the top, saying, I'm a girl's coming at the top, saying, I'm a girl's coming at the top,

786
00:51:43,080 --> 00:52:13,080

787
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:43,080
the world, the world, the world, the world, the world,

788
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:53,080
But I'm not the only one.

789
00:52:53,080 --> 00:53:04,080
I hope someday you'll join the world.

790
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,080
And the world will live this world.

791
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,080
I see you are my hero.

792
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:15,080
Oh, what a great song to wind down the week.

793
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,080
All right, final note.

794
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,080
If you want to get a great deal on a domain name,

795
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,080
I just ruined the vibe, didn't it?

796
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,080
695 used my promo code DSC3.

797
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,080
DailySourceco.com is where you can find the show notes to everything

798
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,080
spoken about, everything relevant in this program,

799
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,080
especially the music.

800
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,080
Thanks to everyone who contributed.

801
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,080
Thanks to everyone in the pod show office here in San Francisco.

802
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,080
I had a great week.

803
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,080
It's been great seeing you guys twice in a month.

804
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,080
A little, little wearing on the old man.

805
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:53,080
But it's just been good all around.

806
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,080
And I have no idea if I'm going to be back here before the end of the year,

807
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,080
or if I'm going to be in New York.

808
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,080
I might have to go to Washington.

809
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,080
It's still be kind of crazy busy.

810
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,080
But I'm sure I'll be back with you on Monday.

811
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,080
More than likely from the curry manner.

812
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:13,080
Remember, live your life with passion and enjoy your freedom.

813
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,080
Another pod show podcast.

814
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,080
Stick it in your ear.

815
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,080
Imagine headphones without wires.

816
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,080

00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,080

00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,080
Pick up yours at Sony.com slash headphones.

820
