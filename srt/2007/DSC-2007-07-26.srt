12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Doesn't make me feel so good to smile.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Everything that everybody got smile in.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Everybody's got the right to say.

Cheese will come from God.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Cheese will come from God.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Cheese will come from God.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Cheese will come from God.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
With the friend that's walked the line for a ride.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You ride around in places of no.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A walk-up is from the way to go.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So smile and say hello.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Missed out the mess I wasn't in the deal of mood.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's my fucking set way to put your hands on from the wall.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You'll be laughed all the way.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Would you have more or more to do?

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes, of course, got to write to me smile in.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And I would have a fight just smile in.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And when you go and change about our smile then.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And when they take you make the same.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Cheese will come from God.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Cheese will come from God.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Cheese will come from God.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Cheese will come from God.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Cheese when they call smile.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When you're shooting a girl.

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Cheese.

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,380
Yeah, I'd say music never didn't have any songs titled Shedder

43
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,580
Lots of cheese though

44
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,860
It's a source code episode 641

45
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,340
Dude with molten cheese

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,600
That's right the cheddar is loose the

47
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,960
Pod Show channel editor

48
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,840
Finally up and rolling have you had a chance to play with it yet?

49
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,960
Of course I'm gonna talk about that today and this what I think will be relatively

50
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,280
Short show on my way out the door to the London office staying in London actually tonight

51
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,680
For some early morning meetings, so that means that to Fubar Friday will be at the end of the UK day

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,680
Oh boy, and I guess I just got to say it

53
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:21,280
When it comes to predicting the weather I I suck at least my long-term forecast really sucking. You know as a

54
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
As an aviator or an airman

55
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,800
50% of what's important in flying is what the weather's going to be where you are

56
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,880
Your destination and of course on route and so

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,240
Whoa, almost I got my headphone just crapped out for a second home

58
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,600
There we go. So, you know, that's that's pretty important stuff now. It's much easier to

59
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,200
predict the weather for the next 12 hours. They even I'm I'm getting kind of good at 24

60
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,440
But only for certain regions that I really focus on because you know, you'll say okay

61
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,120
What's it going to be at the manner and you can look at airport to whether a terminal area forecast

62
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,840
So airport terminals. You can look at Heathrow stands to

63
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
I can look at born myth I can look at

64
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,920
Gatwick obviously and I can get a real idea knowing as well

65
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,920
You know, which way the wind's blowing and what speed I can get a pretty good idea of what's gonna happen in 12 to 24 hours

66
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,360
I definitely have to work on on the longer range forecast because man

67
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,320
It's coming down again. It's really really bad today. This country is in a crisis

68
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,000
You know the next show you here from you. I'm going to be on the freaking roof

69
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,000
You know the temps is overflowing the water just keeps coming down from the skies. It's it's not good

70
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,240
So I'll just say right now. I have no business trying to predict the weather week ahead

71
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,160
If I could I'd probably be the wealthiest man in the universe, but I'm practicing

72
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,560
I'm practicing and just to show you how tough this stuff is this is a fantastic comment

73
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,600
from a a new pilot and a spiring airman

74
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,400
You know Adam David from Colorado listen to DSC

75
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
three

76
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Oh, sorry

77
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,960
DSC six three five hey

78
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,920
Just was listening about that weather. El Niño, La Niña stuff. I got an embryo

79
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,800
I'm gonna be a pilot sometimes here soon. Actually. I got my license

80
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
about a month ago and

81
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,480
I guess like you said you got to know a lot about weather and I've taken a few weather classes

82
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,120
And we've talked about El Niño and La Niña

83
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
a couple times and

84
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,280
Really it only affects the winter weather mainly, but it also affects normal summer time weather sometimes

85
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,960
But what it is is it's a difference of pressures on the

86
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,520
At least it's been down to effected in the United States. I don't know how it's affected in UK

87
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,520
We didn't talk about it

88
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,880
Well obviously, let me just say that the overarching

89
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,120
Things that determine the weather are things like the jet stream and and really it's a lot about wind

90
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,640
Where the wind is going from going to where it's coming from?

91
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,720
The jet stream has huge influences and it changes by seasonality by leap here

92
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,080
And there's a lot of stuff to weather. I'm still in search of the perfect savant for weather in Europe

93
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,640
We talked about how it affects the United States and it really El Niño

94
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:17,680
I don't know if it's higher low in the Pacific or like it's it's like well it's different in pressures on the

95
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
On from the

96
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,760
What's right of China and Indonesia area and then high pressure

97
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,960
Could any American in the class point to Indonesia or in a difference in pressure on the

98
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
West the East

99
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,600
Start over because I really kind of find a thing. Yeah, I appreciate it tried dude

100
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,280
It's a difference in pressure in Indonesia and then the Western half

101
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
the Western side of

102
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
the Americas and

103
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
What happens in El Niño is

104
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,920
Seattle and all that that there's kind of a more of a northerly storm track over the United States and

105
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
There'll be

106
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
weather weather

107
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
more near Seattle and

108
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:16,280
And more toward the south it'll be really dry really really dry and then an El Niño is the opposite of course

109
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Yes, where

110
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
where you got

111
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
You know really dry weather

112
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,760
Really weather you've a lot you've lost me right weather up in Seattle and it just the storm track really in an El Niño is

113
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,920
Sutherly and in it lining it's northerly so I guess that's really I was listening to that and I thought I'd explain

114
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,680
Anyways

115
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,440
Good work dude. I appreciate it. I guess what it's just gonna rain tomorrow

116
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,680
So for instance for here's how here's how I can give you a pretty accurate weather report

117
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Looking at London

118
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,040
Heathrow right now light rain 2300 foot ceiling winds

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
23 knots

120
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,280
Gusting to 30 so a lot of wind that means you can probably see some temporary action

121
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,320
Depending on the cloud cover you could actually get some sunshine in that case and you'll see what they're predicting up until nine p.m. this evening or eight

122
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
8 o'clock UTC

123
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,440
No rain and some broken clouds a

124
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:27,080
2000 feet and then temporarily during the day because of the wind of course it's gonna you know probably be about 30% chance you'll see

125
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,920
Broken clouds who have some sun and then heavy rain showers no thunderstorms though it'd

126
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,800
Protect predicted and and that's always very important for aviation

127
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,480
So if I look at Heathrow and it looks I got week

128
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,440
I mean it looks pretty much the same although the seeding it seems like the rain is going to stop and then

129
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,720
Let me just check yeah, so somewhere between

130
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,560
In the afternoon today it's gonna get nasty. It's gonna be a really heavy rain showers

131
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,200
But there should not be any thunderstorms associated with it

132
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,600

Put it somewhere and of course in in days or maybe a week or two depending on how this

165
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,480
portion of the rollout goes

166
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,880
You'll be able to get that channel and do other things with it

167
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,720
It's been code name cheddar that's for those you're just tuning into the source code thing

168
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,880
What the hell is going on with this cheese stuff?

169
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,400
Cheddar being cheese cheddar kind of sounding like channel editor if you say it fast a couple hundred thousand times

170
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,680
Which I've said certainly at least that many times in the past few weeks

171
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,800
Hey, it works as advertised now we got to figure out what we want from it and if there's a different types of playouts

172
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,320
We can create a party

173
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,480
Actually, I'm trying to track some of this stuff on my blog at curie.com

174
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,000
I've already figured out that would be awesome is to have a play option for the iPhone

175
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
That just renders the channel

176
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,080
You know in the iPhone like in the Safari browser so that you could listen to stuff right there

177
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,760
You know just and the pictures would show up and of course you'd have to be connected

178
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,800
But as you know my hypothesis is that in the

179
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,880
Not too distant future within five years. I think that we'll just have

180
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,640
connectivity everywhere we'll just be so jacked in with broadband at a affordable prices that it really won't matter

181
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,600
If you are listening to it live over the air or if you've downloaded it of course

182
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
You're in particular situations

183
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,320
Yo Adam, let's Peter listen up from Australia

184
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,840
In some of your recent DSCs you've been talking about your channel editors and how

185
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,400
Eventually we could all be just direct streaming at podcasts

186
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:35,000
I can tell you that down here in Australia that's not real likely made after all we've got a land mass the size of the continental

187
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
United States

188
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And only about 20 million people at it

189
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Um

190
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,560
Most of the time your heart press just finding a Wi-Fi connection that works let alone one that you can log into

191
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,160
And yeah keep that with show mate you're doing good. Yeah another play well

192
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,400
What is happening today something is something is messed up

193
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,560
The headphone you know Christina borrowed my headphones and I think she

194
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Did something with the jack probably rolled over it with a chair or something. Okay. There we go

195
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:14,920
I'm not the place I desperately want to visit. I need to go back to Australia because there are only 20 million people in a land mass the size of the United States

196
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
But the women are so good looking

197
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,080
The guys are kind of good looking too. You never really see really ugly Australians. Do you?

198
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:29,640
Well, I think that there are some solutions coming now and I and yes, I do know that

199
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,960
You know when you get outside some of the

200
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:40,760
The urban areas yeah, I mean and I really don't know if a lot of those 20 million are concentrated around the places like Sydney and Melbourne and Perth

201
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,040
I just don't know I think that there's probably a good chunk of them there

202
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,520
But yeah when you get out

203
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,480
Yeah, this headphone crap when you get out there on you know what you guys call a station

204
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,680
You know it could literally take you three days by car just to get from you know get to the neighbor's house

205
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Yeah, there may be some issues with wife

206
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,480
The wife I there and I know that infrastructure in in those cases is complicated

207
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,840
But there are some interesting solutions to that on the horizon

208
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,440
Hey, this is Jared from Central PA Harrisburg actually

209
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,680
I was just listening in at 638 and the conversation you were having about cheddar and the

210
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,400
broadband connectivity and not doing it over sell them at work and those kind of instant

211
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,680
That's we're looking at Twitter yesterday and

212
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,200
They're talking about the whole thing in the Google and the seven of her megahertz

213
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
frequency that

214
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,600
be all the

215
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,560
local and national TV networks for these and

216
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,880
It's broadcast over in Google purchasing it and and making it a nationwide free

217
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,440
network

218
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440
That would be really

219
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,320
Incredible a type of network broadband speeds for downloading and all we have in the connected

220
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,800
You'd be looking forward to have your handheld device iPhone

221
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Blackberry whatever whatever they come out with in the future that's all Wi-Fi that can

222
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,840
automatically connect and download and have your updates all the time as far as what you're want to listen to and

223
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,560
Your podcasts and even if you want any go on in browse music and now on music

224
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,680
It should be a really really neat concept and I just want to know if that was something that you've already heard or which have been looking at with that

225
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
And so I was something that you know

226
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,080
Could be integrated into what you guys are doing and so forth. That's on the guitar

227
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,640
Yeah, thanks

228
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
Keep it up. Thanks. Yeah, man. Thank you

229
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,160
Actually, I heard that Twitter episode as well and I think I had the same aha moment that you had oh by the way

230
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,600
I figured I was wrong the headphones the wire was crawled around the

231
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
The volume knob

232
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,200
So every single time I moved my head the volume was being cranked up. That's that's what the feedback was about

233
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:56,520
Yeah, those 700 megahertz frequencies, you know, so that was always the intent was to

234
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,120
Move all mainstream broadcasters to HD

235
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,560
And using different frequencies and then free up the 700 megahertz

236
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,280
I know I got to say the TV signals man. That's it really blast through all kinds of stuff through walls

237
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,200
You know, huge humongous distances

238
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,120
I'm not quite sure what kind of power you need to power a handheld device to to be able to handle the 700 megahertz man

239
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,800
I don't anything about that

240
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:26,840
I an RF is really tricky business, but there seems to be a lot this is the frequencies the Google is after and and probably they're doing it for the right reasons

241
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,080
You know, hey, we could create our own wireless network. Whatever happened to citizens band

242
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,640
You know, I mean, of course CB radio still there, but you know, why not make this the new citizens band?

243
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,920
There's there's a you know the CB radio network was what 70s break a break a good buddy got you rears

244
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
only got ourselves a convoy

245
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
I think it was mid 70s

246
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,160
So 70s when the citizens band was created that's time for an upgraded the citizens band could can't we call for that?

247
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,200
And maybe it just should be given free you know opened up. I don't know

248
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,560
So those are definitely potential

249
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,600
Potential solutions on the horizon, but all of that as I said within the next five years nothing's gonna happen tomorrow

250
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,120
It's just a slow news period. It's everyone's you know raking all this shit up now

251
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,360
Anyway, what I'd like you to do is if you have created a channel

252
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,800
And remember you can put individual episodes in you can anywhere on podshow.com where you see a get button

253
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,680
You can select the channel you want to put that individual episode or show into

254
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,080
You can edit those you can rearrange the order and then of course you can

255
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,040
Determine for yourself how you want to play it you can put it on your iPod you can stream it

256
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,280
You can play it in our dashboard and of course anyone who comes along and checks out your channels can do the same

257
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,280
I'm looking also

258
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,200
It there must be some real easy RSS widget. I asked if it the furf

259
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,080
You know Chris McIntyre podcast Ali guru. I asked him to create a widget a channels widget. I think you know

260
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,440
I like kind of the style of the the module we have in our profile pages it would be cool if if you could have something like that

261
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,640
It could be an embedded widget, but you could resize it and make it smaller maybe

262
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,080
Cool stuff so I'm

263
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,560
Please send me an email out of it podshow.com. Let me know

264
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,960
What you've created so I can start promoting that and of course we really need a page that

265
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,960
Highlights all the cool channels and don't forget you can search for channels so there is some context and it does appear to work

266
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,600
Although the search definitely has to improve and oh and all just a part of sucking less

267
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,200
I can't tell you how incredibly excited I am and already you know tons of feedback and and questions and

268
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:35,000
Messages send me your audio feedback as well and give me some channels to try out. I need's my chetta

269
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:43,160
Or this yesterday a specific hostel way Mark Yoshimura and him cough got it from iota promo net and I was like dude send me that file now

270
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:06,760
You had them figured out a while ago, and I know it's not exactly breakin' news

271
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:14,280
But it's all in a little like a trial for you and a bunch from talking won't make it

272
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,520
I'll come on go while I take out the trash and once you get it out tell him not to come back again

273
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:31,640
No, why not give him the sling get the hookin' straight get the hookin' good and go

274
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:54,600
So play that he's just makin' it up and he's still got you comin' back for all more

275
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:02,520
Why you never ever think of breaking it up tell me what the back is gonna close that

276
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Top of a comma now while I take out the trash and once you get it out tell him not to come back again

277
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:18,440
No, why not give him the sling get the hookin' straight get the hookin' good and go

278
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:34,380
I'm not sitting out but tries out the same but the borders are sitting in a place up

279
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,900
and I'm not sitting out but ones are sitting up but somebody's on the same and I's staying

280
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:52,020
I'm not sitting out but one's on the same,but somebody's on the same band

281
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:59,020
Why not take out the trash, and once you get them out, tell them not to come back again

282
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:07,020
Go back out in the gym, after what you said, to everything you did

283
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:15,020
Now why not take out the trash?

284
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:32,020
Come on now why not take out the trash, and once you get them out, tell them not to come back again

285
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,020
Now why not get them out in the sling, and they will come back again

286
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:41,020
and they will get them out.

287
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,220
I've never been a fan of they might be Giants, but I heard the song I was just like,

288
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,500
whoa, dude, that's awesome. It's from my auto-promenet. I'll find the link and put that in

289
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,700
the show notes, of course. I looked and see if it was on the pod save music network. There

290
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,340
is a, they might be Giants song up there, but it's not this one. Take out the trash. I love

291
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,860
this song, man. Maybe I was missing a lot of they might be Giants. Maybe I just didn't get it,

292
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,580
or I was in the wrong type mode or whatever, you know, early MTV days. Okay,

293
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:15,180
DailySourceco.com, Adam at podshow.com, and finally, before I leave you today, some very

294
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,860
sad news, but I was asked to pass that along to the listeners, the DailySourcecoat. You recall

295
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:29,660
that a young poet was very excited about, this is so fucked up. He played the sound of his

296
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,940
unborn baby's heartbeat on the hit test. On the last hit test he did. And yesterday sent me

297
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:41,740
a message that, unfortunately, his wife, Victorine, Miss Carried, and so you can understand

298
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,580
that things are kind of messed up over there. He did actually already have a hit test created

299
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,220
for the footballer Friday, but since so many people were calling and emailing him because they

300
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:57,100
heard it on the show and were congratulating them. They both want to be to pass that along to you.

301
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:02,860
So, of course, young and Victorine are in our prayers and in our thoughts in what's going to be

302
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:10,460
a tough time for them. Okay, tomorrow, we'll celebrate the food hardness of the week,

303
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,020
meet you there.
