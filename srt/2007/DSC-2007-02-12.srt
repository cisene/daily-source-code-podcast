1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And the Grammy for best episode of a podcast goes to.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh no surprise here, it's Adam Curry and the Daily Source Code 544.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm just kidding.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's Adam Curry.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Give him a sit here sir.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Keep your beauty.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Don't miss your early 544.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Not all of us can say what bullshit is made of, but we know it when we smell it.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
There are many shades of grey, but any of us know when we're being left in the dark.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's fine.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Time to call the lie lie.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If facts were faces, they'd be staring at us.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The rain, and the news as no analysis, it's not hard to understand.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
When one side says a man, it is sandwich, and the other says the sandwich ain't the man.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's why, time for everyone to rise.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Pick up some soap and water and to scrub away the lies.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The hard truth, the hard truth.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's your fundamental duty.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Speak to truth, see the truth.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Like you and the light for beauty.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The hard truth, the hard truth.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The hard truth, the hard truth.

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The hard truth, the hard truth.

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Excuse me, did you hear that the whole time?

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I had my mic open and you were hearing me snondering throughout the entire song.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Just noticed the mic was open during the entire song.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So you probably did hear me snorting up a wad if you couldn't tell by the nasal qualities of my voice.

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Well, then you kind of understand what kind of weekend I had.

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The lady Patricia just as much out and down for the count.

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Excuse me.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Crap.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Luckily, it's half-term.

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Midterm, half-term, half-term, I think.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So we didn't have to get a burly Christina didn't have to go to school.

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And Indiana, my son-in-law, he was over for most of the weekend.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And he helped out.

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And the kids were good.

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So that didn't make a difference.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But when mom and dad are both sick, it really does blow major chunks.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I've been collecting stuff over the weekend.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I couldn't do much.

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I was completely the third jig, too.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Actually, went for a nice walk across the road here, across from the curry matter.

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The shantries that we look out upon, and that was really nice.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You know, got a little bit of oxygen, walked for a good hour or so.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And then totally collapsed in front of a bowl of Patricia's chicken soup with ginger.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I tried to watch some of the red carpet coverage from both the BAFTA awards.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's the British Film and Television Awards.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Which seems to have more Americans than Brits winning awards as well as in the audience.

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And then the Grammy Awards, which, and this was all the E red carpet coverage,

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
which usually is fun, but man, it's gotten down to such a machine.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You know, it's no longer the excitement of seeing the stars.

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's like, you know, this Warren Bady is scheduled to be here at 137.

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And the question, and who are you wearing?

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And who are you wearing?

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'd have fuck you.

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I went out and bought my own shit.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hey, hey, hey.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, that's not true.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'd accept all kinds of clothes and jewelry, earrings.

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Send them to me.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So collecting stuff, listening to the voice mail this morning,

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
of course, people understand exactly how I feel and want to keep me in a good mood.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
For I 42, you're fucking calm.

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And you won't go to fucking calm.

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You're fucking young.

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And you're fucking calm.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're fucking cold.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey, you go.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm not a fucking parmium of fucking young and a faggot.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank you.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I feel so much better now.

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hi, Adam.

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This is Randy from Germany.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And do you want to improve your German?

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Let's give it a try.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How do you say in German to urinate sitting?

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sit in pink room.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Nah.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What?

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's not...

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Sit in pink room.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Pink room.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's...

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Sit in pink room.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Pink room, but...

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's better to say...

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
In...

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Sit in pink room.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
In sit in pink room.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Repeat.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is it pink room or pink room?

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Pink room?

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
In sit in pink room.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay, repeat.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Ready.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
In sit in pink room.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
In sit in pink room.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well done.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay.

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And...

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is better than exercise.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In sit in pink room.

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Ah, now seven more times.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
In sit in pink room.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm someone new-nating to think.

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I have to say...

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I think...

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
In sit in...

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Ah, I...

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I think...

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
In sit in...

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I think...

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I think...

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
In sit in...

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think...

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think...

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And...

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Now you can see...

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I think...

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
In sit in pink room.

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Ah!

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I think...

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Pink room.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think...

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
In sit in pink room.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So...

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I think...

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well done.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
In sit in pink room.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah.

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yeah.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
In joy.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sit in pink room.

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
In those more German lessons you can find at...

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Blockcast.potcho.com.

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Excellent.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Blockcast.potcho.com.

149
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I've been in sit in pink room.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Good day.

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I get juice.

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Grisgot.

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Achtual.

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So...

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I've been thinking a lot lately about go daddy.

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And over the years you've heard other podcasts you're saying.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Use my code and enter in it at the time of checkout and you'll get $2 off.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Dude, that's not how we roll with the jersey touch.

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So tonight I'm going to get you $200 off very, very simply.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Go over to godaddy.com and get yourself 100 domain names.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I know you think you don't need them now.

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But over the course of your lifetime I got with the...

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
With the internet and the way the things are going with the future and all the domain names that you're going to need.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You might as well just buy them all tonight.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I mean, you need it.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Your kids need it.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Your legacy demands that you buy yourself 100 domain names.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, normally that's going to cost you about $895.

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But tonight, if you enter in the code jersey three at the time of checkout,

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
bam right there $695.

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You can't beat that.

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Of course, if you only want to order one domain name and who can live with just one domain name,

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
it's going to cost you $695 if you enter in the code jersey three at the time of checkout.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But really, when it comes down to it, when it's all about domain names,

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
it's all about godaddy and it's all about ordering in bulk.

177
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
JT.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
S.J.T. Sergio Zetad trying to hawk his domain names through the source code.

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Interesting.

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You know, we could actually start a whole option business in domain names.

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You know, where you don't actually have to pay, but you take an option.

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So maybe you pay a tenth of the price.

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So like, would be like 60 or 70 cents.

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Excuse me, Fulger's coffee with Splenda makes a wonderful combination.

185
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Those gourmet blends can't wait Friday.

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I think I'm flying out to the States.

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
If my head isn't like a frickin' rock piece of the rock.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hey.

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, you could do a real, there could be a real option business.

190
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You know, so just look at the godaddy.

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So incredibly successful.

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That thing's just like printing money.

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's unreal.

194
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Bob Parsons, smart fucker.

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Really.

196
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I learned something very important.

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Do not repeat.

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Do not keep Google notebook open on multiple computers.

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You know, since we moved into the manner and since,

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and of course, the wireless capabilities here and I've set up the studio.

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I still have about 10 or 11 boxes left.

202
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So I'm getting there.

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But I'm using the via is pretty much docked 24.7.

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's docked at the studio station.

205
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And it also has the flight sim on it, which is the station next to it.

206
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I just had to extend the cables.

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And I've got the big Apple cinema display and the flight controls.

208
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Next to it.

209
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And then I'm using a secondary via.

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Much less powerful one, but the same nice big keyboard keys that I like.

211
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm using that at my desk, which is in the middle of the room.

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Or if in the morning, I'm sitting in the big ugly green thing with my cup of tea.

213
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Next to the heater, the fireplace.

214
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Then I use that.

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And of course, throughout the rest of the house, I've been using the Nokia N800 internet tablet with great success.

216
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It really is perfect just for keeping tabs and having something nearby.

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And there's just no reason to log anything else around.

218
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Unless I really want to sit down and type something serious.

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And then I want a full keyboard.

220
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't care.

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The display is also important at that point.

222
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What the hell was I going to talk about?

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What was my point?

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Ah, right.

225
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So I've been keeping my Google notebooks open on multiple computers.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And what I've noticed can happen is you can have a whole list of stuff that you've added to your notebook.

227
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You go to the other computer.

228
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And then you look at the notebook and it has a much shorter list than then you refresh it.

229
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And if you close the wrong one at the wrong time, it's going to save an older copy.

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So you understand what I'm saying?

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Basically, these things are continuously.

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I guess whenever you touch it, it writes a copy to the Google notebook server.

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And if it sees a different notebook, I don't think it's just smart enough yet to understand that no,

234
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
there's a newer version.

235
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And I want to update this one with the newer version.

236
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
At least it's not working that way.

237
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You have to actually physically close it and reopen it.

238
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Not doing that could result in tears.

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I mean, really big tears.

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So throughout the week and had some time to look around it stuff online.

241
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You know, project plus is I think definitely come in together.

242
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I saw another episode of the Brittany Mason show Brittany Mason.

243
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
My girlfriend from second life and I haven't seen her in about a year.

244
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But she's not doing a show, which and for the first time,

245
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
if you've seen her in second life, maybe at the pod show island,

246
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
you know, she doesn't really have a voice.

247
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Doesn't talk there.

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But you can hear talking in this show.

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And it's what does it review from the grid or something like that?

250
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Which is kind of cool.

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You should check that out Brittany Mason show dot pod show dot com.

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And thank you to several people who inquired if I was okay.

253
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Because a small aircraft, private aircraft.

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
In this case, it was a paper.

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I think it was a four-seater.

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
A crashed in a crashed in France.

257
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
American father mother and child on board.

258
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And people were very were even though they knew that it probably wasn't me.

259
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And I get this a lot when something crashes anywhere in the.

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
On the western side of the continent or anywhere on the eastern side of the island.

261
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I get, I get a lot of those calls and emails.

262
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Thank you very much for being concerned.

263
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It really sucks for those people.

264
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I have no idea what happened.

265
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And we had another paper air crash just last week.

266
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Also, I think off the, was it the southern coast, south western coast of England?

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Man, those things are just like falling out of the sky.

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't want to say too much about, you know, about papers.

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But I would like to know what's happening.

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000

I'm using pot safe.

286
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Here I am just doing a Google Gmail search,

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
love it.

288
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Pot safe commercial is what I type in.

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Gmail goes to work comes back and gives me a couple of options.

290
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes, no.

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No, that wasn't it.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It came up with the, came up with the Jeff Smith.

293
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Crap.

294
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
We got to send that to me.

295
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, I like it anyway.

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's a good idea to have a commercial for the pot set music network,

297
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
which reminds me I completely forgot to tell you that the first song today was Jim's

298
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Big ego.

299
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Pot safe music network veteran with support the truth.

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And I like that a lot because, you know, it sounds like support the troops,

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
but it's saying something else.

302
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And it's a, you know, I like it.

303
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I like it when stuff is right on the money when it comes to music.

304
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
When the lyrics, you know, can, can really hit home.

305
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And we can do these things so quickly now.

306
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
They don't have to wait half, you know, half a year to release.

307
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You're politically motivated song through some arcane channel.

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Pretty interesting.

309
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I, although, of course, I didn't see the Grammy Awards because I don't think they were even

310
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
being carried live last night, but it would have been too late anyway.

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Dixie chick's big winners, five Grammys.

312
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Ah, boy.

313
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
How we swing from one side to the, to the other.

314
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You know what, they deserve such a big apology.

315
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And I bet you there's a lot of people there who, who, who, who, who, who are now cheering

316
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
them.

317
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That hypocrites.

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Hi.

319
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm, uh, Schema, sorry.

320
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Had enough semesters.

321
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You mentioned on the NC 540.

322
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And again, that the, uh, the comments.

323
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Congratulations.

324
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You know, the I'm the charger for Nokia.

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You know, it, it, it, it's taken me two years, but I can actually

326
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
understand what the guy is saying.

327
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I miss pronounce his name.

328
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And it's actually Schema's, not Schema's, but Schema's.

329
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And there's your age, age problem entering again.

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And he's, and he's talking about the ant dick plug for all new Nokia devices.

331
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Just setting up, yanks.

332
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And not only people miss a nice, my name, not a problem.

333
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But it's a links to the, the, the heaps versus each of the

334
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
questions you've been having.

335
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Because my name is Stelk.

336
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
As if it should be when I'd seen this.

337
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But it's, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the Schema's.

338
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He knew the, uh, the Schema's still there with him.

339
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What, um, the other thing regarding it's ant hits, uh, is an interesting, uh,

340
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
thing, I'm from Northern Ireland, and not part of the world.

341
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Heaps versus each is an example of what's called a cible, which is, uh,

342
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
where a pronunciation of a word or a letter shows a membership of a social

343
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
or ethnic group.

344
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And the case of, uh, the North of Ireland, uh,

345
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
say it's, and traffic's a hitch, uh, to big data, not part of the world,

346
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
unfortunately, but, uh, a shouldn't be, um, just as you'd like to hear this,

347
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
as I know you have your lucky charms.

348
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm scared.

349
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And the sides of Ireland, uh,'re, uh, luck email like to hear some of the

350
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
road listeners from North as well.

351
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I like you, uh, like he charms.

352
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And keep up with charge, uh, my, uh,

353
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Ian Folger.

354
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Of course you're not a scruncher, not a folder, but a

355
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,240
But a fulger.

356
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,400
Yeah.

357
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,040
Yeah.

358
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,440
Bless me like he's like a chams.

359
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm like he stars me like he chams.

360
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,360
Good to have your board.

361
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,520
Of course, there's people of North listening.

362
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,960
I'm amazed at how many people from the UK are now

363
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,800
turning into the show.

364
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
I look at the stats the other day.

365
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,920
I'm like, wow, that's, as probably about almost 30%

366
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,080
of the audience is real.

367
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,880
And it's not just the UK.

368
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,640
It's also further east in Europe.

369
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,840
You know, I had a, this is Matthias calling in from Bonn in Germany.

370
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,160
I just wanted to tell you how much I like putster.com.

371
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:15,160
I just found a thing that you stopped me a little.

372
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:22,400
Being that when you set up a new putster, you could select default messages

373
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,520
either messages, languages, either an English or Spanish.

374
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,880
Now, I don't want you to translate the whole thing in German,

375
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,520
but it would be cool if you could select your putster's German.

376
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,320
Now, that's all for now.

377
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,000
Thank you.

378
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,600
Bye.

379
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,720
That's photo.

380
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
Yeah, that's fine.

381
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,160
Yeah, I don't care.

382
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,960
Thomas, that's interesting.

383
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,560
I'll, you know, engineering listens to the show.

384
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,960
So I know that they're going to check it out.

385
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
It doesn't make a lot of sense.

386
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
That's it.

387
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,720
There would only be two types of languages that you can produce shows in being English

388
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,440
and Spanish.

389
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,760
I believe that those tags are meant solely for metadata information.

390
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,480
They probably are of some influence on the iTunes.

391
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,720
You know, we add all of the iTunes tags and the category stuff.

392
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,960
And they have their whole incredible namespace that you have to add in to your RSS feeds.

393
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:26,280
If you want to get proper ranking and search results within iTunes, it should have any

394
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,680
multitude of languages.

395
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Those are basically abbreviations.

396
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,560
The list should be no different from a list of states in the United States.

397
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,280
It's a pre-populated list.

398
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,560
So I'll check out it for sure.

399
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,040
In the meantime, if you select English, it's not going to do anything.

400
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,320
It won't hurt anything.

401
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,680
That's for sure.

402
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,000
And you can always go back and change it, so I'll look into it for you.

403
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I was so disappointed.

404
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,180
John Glasscox sent me a note that the Ignation Boys, Alex and Kevin, they did the most

405
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:07,320
recent show on board Virgin Atlantic US Airbus A320, which of course, you know, the airline

406
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,240
isn't flying yet, you know, Virgin US or Virgin America or everything going to call it.

407
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,720
But it seems like they have some kind of sponsorship with Ignation.

408
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,320
Oh, I'm really hurt.

409
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,040
I'm really am.

410
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
I can't believe it.

411
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,440
It doesn't, well, you know, I think they're going to do their first show on board.

412
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,160
I don't know.

413
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,600
I have no idea what it is, but for some reason, they're on board the Virgin plane, and

414
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
I'm not.

415
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,680
And I got to tell you, you can stake your stinking red eye pot and shove it with a son-done

416
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,480
shine, Mr. Virgin CEO, you know, come on.

417
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,640
I want the Daily Source Code listeners to have a shot at having a party on board of your

418
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
A320.

419
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,400
Well, we'll make a party out of it all right, but come on, the Ignation guy is going to be

420
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
a break.

421
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,000
Hey, Adam, it's a look speaking, just landed here at the Amsterdam Airport of my way to

422
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,840
Barcelona, you know, the 3GSM madness.

423
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,800
That's just a question for you, just wondering if you haven't been out of everybody

424
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:10,080
knows what is the longest podcast ever, or let's say the longest regular podcast.

425
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,880
I'm subscribed to the Silhobit.com podcast, and they have started now with a weekly show of

426
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,560
two and a half hours of progressive rock, which is kind of brutal to listen to, of course,

427
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,880
two and a half hours of podcasting.

428
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,160
Anyway, I just thought it might be serious to know what's the longest podcast ever.

429
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Thanks, Mike.

430
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,160
All right, there's Luke Montezway to the 3GSM conference.

431
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,360
Watch out for comics for blogger.

432
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,920
He's looking right behind your back.

433
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
It seems to be a pretty big deal.

434
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,960
I was reading in the newspaper over the weekend that was at 60,000 attendees or something

435
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
for this conference.

436
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,480
That's pretty major.

437
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,280
Of course, this is where everyone rolls out their vision for the future, not

438
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,720
of it compatible with anyone else's vision coincidentally.

439
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,760
The longest podcast, I don't know, you'd probably have to look at music podcasts, and

440
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,720
are you talking about longest episode, or if you put all the daily source codes back

441
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,880
to back, you'd have one pretty big, I wonder.

442
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,760
Could you fit it on an iPod?

443
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Let me see.

444
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:22,440
Average was probably an average of 25 megabytes, okay, hold on, let's do this now.

445
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,760
I could give away daily source code, I filled iPods.

446
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,280
That's a cool idea.

447
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
Hold on.

448
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,120
Let me just pull up the calculator here, I have my brain associated.

449
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:51,240
So it's 25 million, 3456 times 544 is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

450
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Is it 1,000?

451
00:22:52,240 --> 00:23:00,880
No, hold on, how many zeros I have, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

452
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:10,200
So that would be 13,000, 13,000 megabytes is 13 gigs.

453
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,680
No, you couldn't actually fit it on to one iPod, is there, no, no, of course you could.

454
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,320
One of my saying, there's iPods with much more than 3.

455
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,040
You couldn't fit it on the new iPhone though.

456
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
Speaking of phones.

457
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:40,520
Did you find yourself singin' along with that at any point?

458
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,160
It took me two plays when listening to one of the voicemail before it hit me, I, yes, I know

459
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
what that is.

460
00:23:45,480 --> 00:24:00,160
4, 4, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3, plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.

461
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,160
By the way, that also works for all you serious satellite radio listeners out there listening

462
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,600
to serious channel 102, you're probably in the States if you are, so use this number.

463
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:28,360
I remember the plus is for extra savings and if you travel outside of the continental

464
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,400
US with your mobile phone.

465
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,640
Okay, they're gone.

466
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,440
Let's see, I have like two more voicemail messages I want to go through and then a beautiful

467
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,480
song that I found on the part that actually was one of the top ten played songs last

468
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
week.

469
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,840
No yesterday, I'm sorry, the part that music network, some classical stuff which I think

470
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
you're like.

471
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,840
I'm just picking on some, I'm not even telling you, I'm wrong and stop the comment

472
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
if you want to.

473
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,840
I'm not going to pick up on this yet.

474
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,440
I sometimes just know this from here, listen to the DSC and this point of people probably

475
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,240
pay for anything.

476
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,480
Whenever tampons or anything to do with menstrual cycles mentioned, you're seen to

477
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:19,480
have all the bleep fringe and sooner this system wrong, that doesn't.

478
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,480
Well, it's only been you, I think, has been calling in with men.

479
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,280
Well, you know what, it's just because I can already imagine the met and I know what

480
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:32,040
mess people can make when it comes to sanitary napkins and tampons, I'm sorry, I'm just

481
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,040
not interested in sharing that with the audience.

482
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,040
But I think I understand where you're coming from, let's listen to the DSC.

483
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:45,040
I'm not sure if my go through a problem with my daughter or my daughter, then somebody

484
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:50,640
previous in our life was like that and she's only to stop around the fact that it's

485
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,040
quite normal to be right at home and probably should be celebrated.

486
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a very fair point James.

487
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,040
No, and Christina has already gone through her initial stages.

488
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,040
And no, we celebrated it too, that's like a, it's like a big moment to sing in life.

489
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Even though she was really fucking grouchy when we were celebrating.

490
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
But no, no, no, no, no, no.

491
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
None of that at home.

492
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,040
This is just purely because I don't, well, I don't think people are interested in hearing

493
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
about it.

494
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
They get the picture, I guess, is what I'm saying.

495
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Anyway, that's the season, you know, you, you see my mind, see the ceremony chair and

496
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
cringe when you heard it.

497
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,040
The other things, I'm not, what a completely idea.

498
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,040
And you mentioned on Trinity, win valuable prizes.

499
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,040
But I'm a bit baffled as to why I put your reports to see the win valuable prizes.

500
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,040
The last thing I ever heard of anybody winning from Portugal on the daily source call

501
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,040
was an iPod and that was quite a while back.

502
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,040
You know, I won a free iPod.com or whatever.

503
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,040
And I'm just wondering, you know, let us know what valuable prizes, what come people

504
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:00,040
win if the part taken this, if they're going to win Trinity, you know, if they're going to win

505
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,040
that jump from a bio deal, if they're going to win the party.

506
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
I don't know.

507
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Oh, James, no, no, no, no, no, you're so confused.

508
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,040
The whole point is save the world win valuable prizes.

509
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
And you save the world.

510
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,040
Don't you think there'll be some very valuable prizes that will win James, like life?

511
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Oh, look at for free fucking iPod.

512
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Alright.

513
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:33,040
So another, another new friend of the show who's been around for a while.

514
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,040
And he sent in so many audio comments, but I've played relatively few because he's so difficult

515
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,040
to understand, prolific programmer.

516
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Dude, I think you've really got, I think you've got your shit down.

517
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:51,040
All over the free Trinity Google Group with posting code that he says will work on the

518
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
on the Nokia N800.

519
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,040
And I think the guy might actually have his chops down.

520
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,040
I'm just waiting, you know, because a couple other people in the list who are involved

521
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
in the conversation.

522
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,040
If you're of tin foil hat nature, you may want to go and check it out.

523
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,040
And I was bitching about my Gmail space that, you know, for the past year, I've been

524
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:17,040
just at 99% on my four gigabytes of storage, which, of course, is a special deal.

525
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Everybody else is about 2.8 now, but I get a, you know, friends and family could get more.

526
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
But it's still not enough.

527
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
And I'm willing to pay for it.

528
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,040
Just tell me, can I get enough to keep me going?

529
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,040
You know, I'm sure I'll be up to 10 gigs by the end of the year.

530
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,040
If I actually were to save every single attachment that came my way.

531
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,040
But I'm willing to pay for it, not a problem.

532
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,040
You know, so, of course, I get no response, you know.

533
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,040
But I do get some suggestion from that very same prolific programmer.

534
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:52,040
But father, this is the prolific programmer from San Francisco, also in the sun.

535
00:28:52,040 --> 00:29:00,040
I was listening to your show, DSC 543, and you were iranting about Gmail for about

536
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,040
the 100th time or something about Gmail having free space.

537
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,040
I have come up with the solution.

538
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:13,040
I personally, you know, what you think is at prolificprogrammer.com.

539
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:18,040
Ask the LOG and the, and the, and the,

540
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,040
think it, and this is how to achieve limitless stimuli today.

541
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Let me know what you think.

542
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,040
Either by person to comment or on your podcast.

543
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
We'll be listening.

544
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Cheers.

545
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
All right.

546
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
Guy almost needs a jingle.

547
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,040
I'm just going to prolificprogrammer.com slash blog.

548
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Here it is.

549
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,040
Was listening to Adam rant about not having enough Gmail storage space and realize it

550
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
come up with a scheme to solve his problem.

551
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Okay.

552
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,040
He noted in a previous episode that he wouldn't mind paying Google for the space.

553
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
But Adam, do you mind paying Amazon?

554
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Well, no, how about how is Amazon going to give me more Gmail space?

555
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:03,040
Because S3 advertisers write, read, and delete objects containing from one to five gigabytes of data each.

556
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,040
The number of objects you can store is unlimited.

557
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
In other words, since

558
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Charis is Gmail account.

559
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Huh?

560
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
Who's Charis?

561
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Whatever.

562
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:19,040
Holds 2,815 megabytes or 2.8 gigs.

563
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,040
You can back up your whole Gmail archive for less than 25 pens.

564
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,040
First we need to retrieve message messages and serialize this list.

565
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,040
Then divide this into five gigabytes blocks and put them on S3.

566
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Then go back to Gmail and delete them.

567
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Presto more space on Gmail.

568
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Yeah.

569
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
But prolific programmer.

570
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,040
The whole point of having that in Gmail is so that I can search through it.

571
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,040
That's the power of Gmail.

572
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Besides there's short cut key commands.

573
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,040
You know, the J and K and the H and J and K, essentially.

574
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,040
And oh, which, you know, I'm used to being an old command line guy.

575
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,040
And just old in general.

576
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,040
You know, the whole point is having the search.

577
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,040
So if you can figure out a way to do that and have it search across Amazon's S3.

578
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Shit, yeah.

579
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
I mean, I'll pay you to implement for me.

580
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Hi, Adam.

581
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
This is Mal and Amsterdam.

582
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
I run the segue to this here.

583
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,040
My company's name and URL is a glide.cc.

584
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,040
We were in contact by email back in 2005.

585
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
When I set up my segue towards operation here.

586
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
And I had to react to your comment on Friday.

587
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
How it's impossible to make it.

588
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
There's an entrepreneur in the Netherlands.

589
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Because the state has recently put me out of business.

590
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Oh, surprise there.

591
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,040
This is a guy who I spoke to when I was creating.

592
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
I still have the segue, by the way.

593
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
It's got two flat tires or empty tires.

594
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
I don't think they're punctured.

595
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,040
I got to pump it up.

596
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
And we could mess around with it here.

597
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
This is when I was big into the segue.

598
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
I thought it was, you know, cool.

599
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Obviously brought one over from the states.

600
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,040
And so this guy started a business segue towards very much like my body

601
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Mike has done in Miami.

602
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
Where, you know, you can tour around the city.

603
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Amsterdam was perfect for this.

604
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,040
But of course, you know, you have such a left wing government,

605
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
which actually we don't even have a government yet.

606
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,040
I don't think they're.

607
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,040
But the mayor Amsterdam is without a doubt left wing.

608
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
They're going to outlaw that shit.

609
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
No fun anymore.

610
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,040
I don't know if you heard that the Dutch police made writing segues anywhere.

611
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,040
On public roads or sidewalks illegal as are the beginning of the year.

612
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,040
This after almost two years when they were allowed.

613
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
How full bar is that?

614
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Yeah.

615
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,040
We've been working under agreements made with local offices in the city.

616
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,040
And those whole two years and we had no problems at all with safety.

617
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
No accidents, no incidents.

618
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,040
I think you know how safe these machines are once you're trained to ride them.

619
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
If there's some bureaucratic thing, please.

620
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
It's decided that come the new year.

621
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,040
They would be illegal again.

622
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Well, dude, it wasn't the police.

623
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
They're only supposed to enforce it.

624
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
The police are making that shit up.

625
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Then you're in real trouble.

626
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
But I don't think that's it.

627
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,040
I think it's the local municipality has made that decision.

628
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
It could have been a national thing.

629
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
You'd have to look into it.

630
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,040
You really should because if the police are making that shit up,

631
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
I don't think they have the right to.

632
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Maddie investment in sales made by the local Dutch seguid distributors.

633
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,040
No matter my own investment in setting up and running tours.

634
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,040
I don't even know if you're going to accuse me of trying to grab some promo gear off the Charlie.

635
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,040
That is for my segue tours in Amsterdam day and evening.

636
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,040
My company website at the URL galid.cc.

637
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
Since as I said, the law here is set me down.

638
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Although I assume that this ban will be overturned sooner or later.

639
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,040
I realize you've had your own encounters with the Dutch authorities while trying to

640
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
innovate projects.

641
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,040
So if you have any tips on what to do or who to contact solve this thing,

642
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
I'd be grateful to get them.

643
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
Yeah.

644
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,040
All the guys I know got kicked out.

645
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,040
Mark from the horse.

646
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Other people left.

647
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
Yeah.

648
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,040
So I don't think I can help you there anymore.

649
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Amsterdam is going completely left wing.

650
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,040
They're also, they decided against privatizing civil airport,

651
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,040
which is about economically speaking.

652
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
The stupidest thing you can do.

653
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
Oh, man.

654
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Watch Frank for a grow like an MF now.

655
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Yeah.

656
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
It's a hub.

657
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
You've got to be able to expand.

658
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,040
Yeah.

659
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
It sucks if you live under the flight path.

660
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
But you know, you knew you were living under the flight path.

661
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
You knew it could get busier.

662
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
No, dude.

663
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
I don't think I feel bad for it.

664
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,040
But I don't think there's going to be any overturning of that ruling.

665
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Don't we sell the same thing?

666
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,040
Remember those zapies, the electric scooters, same thing?

667
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Yeah.

668
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Maybe you should convert to bikes.

669
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
It's about the only thing I can think of for you.

670
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,040
And when segues do become legal again here, whenever that is.

671
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,040
I'd be pleased to take you in the ladies around on my slate of machines.

672
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Maybe along with one of my safety assistance.

673
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,040
So keep that in mind that we don't usually go pick up our customers.

674
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,040
But we have done that before in front of the Amstel Hotel.

675
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,040
I'm sorry.

676
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,040
I'm afraid that was not for making teeth in the boys.

677
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,040
But anyway, I'd be glad to do that again for you.

678
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,040
Or you say you're too busy even to have dinner with somebody.

679
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
Okay.

680
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Then maybe just to write around with the ladies and maybe with your son-in-law.

681
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
Just get in touch through our website.

682
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,040
That's your glide.cc.

683
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
And flipper.

684
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
Yeah.

685
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
With my son-in-law indeed.

686
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
Yeah.

687
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
That's what I need, dude.

688
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,040
I need pictures of me and my extended family riding around on segues and Amsterdam.

689
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,040
Yeah.

690
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,040
Yeah.

691
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,040
That's really, that's keeping a low profile.

692
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
Don't you think?

693
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,040
All right.

694
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
Who knows what the rest of the week is going to bring us?

695
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
Hopefully a little bit better health.

696
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
I hope you're feeling okay.

697
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,040
It seems that I, you know, first I got the US variant of this flu.

698
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,040
I got through that, which involved a lot of coughing.

699
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,040
And now I have the UK variant.

700
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,040
I guess either I never really fully recovered.

701
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,040
Was too weak or there's just no way you can resist both strains of it.

702
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Whatever it is, it sucks.

703
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,040
So I'm going to leave you with a beautiful piece of music that I found from the

704
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,040
cello journey podcast.

705
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,040
I should say the cello journey podcast.

706
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,040
That's cello with a h.

707
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,040
Without the h.

708
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
A preserves.

709
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
My God, be out for.

710
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,040
Thank you.

711
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
Thank you.

712
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,040
Thank you.

713
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Thank you.

714
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,040

That's nice, isn't it?

718
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,040
I love the cello.

719
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
It's a beautiful instrument.

720
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Sounds so nice.

721
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
And it kind of fits the.

722
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
The mode that my head is in for today.

723
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
