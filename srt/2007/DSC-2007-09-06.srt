1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
He had him, it's an issue for him.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
One time they'll talk.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Niscuit them girls' body last time.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It was a blast.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What's the people going to be coming to see me from that one?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Till we are the SC660.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Not to be presumptuous.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Or I was kind of expecting you to be reaching out to me.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
To be a son on about six years.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I mean they'd do call my number right.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Just let me know when you want to get together for that.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And while you're in the state, I think it's down there away.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But we know we can do lunch.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There is this flame glow bugger doing this to die for.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Take care of Adam.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Have fun and episode 660 of the Charlie.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And I'll talk to you soon.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Ah, ah, ah.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I like to think I was lying in the kitchen.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Fantastic.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's a matter of courage.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
To talk to a baby, go to rehab.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I said no, no, no.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes, I've even played for when I come back.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, no, no.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't got the time.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And if my daddy thinks I'll fly.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's not a lady going to rehab.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You know that love you.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You know that love you.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You know that love you.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You know that love you.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You know that love you.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You know that love your love.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You know that love love.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You know that love.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You know that love dear Matt wake up and let me play the peer.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So why don't you take me home,

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Didn't get all out of your class

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But I know we don't come

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In a sharp glass

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's all of me going

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sitting in no, no, no

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There's something right

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We are perfect

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No, no, no

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I need a time

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Should I don't believe I love you?

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I love you

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Just the power

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Should I make it a match to me?

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah, I'm myself

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No, no, no, no, no, no

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
There's something right there

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm not a time

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But I know we don't come

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But I know we don't come

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But I know we don't come

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We're going to call you name

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Girl, it's just a fight

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm a fool

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Tited, I'm a fool

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No, no, no

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm being go through the mirror

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I say no, no, no

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, I've been back, we are gone back, you know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:25,120
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and so on.

77
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,440
And somebody that got a pretty sudden middle for something, comes from my autobiography.

78
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,760
And somebody that had met him or something, this guy knows how to mash it up, doesn't it?

79
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,040
Why me?

80
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,440
projet.

81
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

82
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,920
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Four top smashed up by Party Ben there with Amy Winehouse.

84
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,920
By the way, it's got to be a prime example of the spectacle of the society.

85
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Would somebody please help that girl and stop just writing trash about her,

86
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,920
do something, pull her out of the shit that she's in?

87
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

88
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,920
It is a daily source code episode number, what is it?

89
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
60.

90
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Oh, man.

91
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Yeah, Lucifer.

92
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
We are going to close it in on you.

93
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Right now it is 4.

94
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,920
48 AM on Thursday.

95
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Today is September 6th, 2007.

96
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Why?

97
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
So early.

98
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Well, I woke up.

99
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,920
I woke up at about 4 AM.

100
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
I just came out of a dead sleep.

101
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Actually, the glands in my throat hurt a little bit.

102
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm not quite sure why.

103
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Particularly on the left side, so maybe, yeah, if I tilt my head a little bit,

104
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,920
maybe, just hurt a bit and it woke me up.

105
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
But also, it's not been a very standard trip for me.

106
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,920
It's been an emotional roller coaster.

107
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Of course, with the passing of our dear, dear pussycat Cindy.

108
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Yesterday, you know, fox with you, what can I tell you?

109
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Oh, I have to thank everybody.

110
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
So incredibly much.

111
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,920
You know, I said, if you want to send an email about, about Cindy, about a pussycat,

112
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,920
please send it to Patricia.

113
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Hundreds of emails came in.

114
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,920
And I got to tell you, this was so incredibly helpful because, you know,

115
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Patricia's family lives in the Netherlands.

116
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
So they're not next door.

117
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,920
They're very close or sister and parents.

118
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm not there.

119
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Christina has to go off to a two day I love white trip with her new school, kind of,

120
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
like a get-to-know-you type of trip, I guess.

121
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,920
So, you know, she's really lonely.

122
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,920
And she said, and I know my wife pretty well.

123
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
We've been married for 21 years.

124
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,920
But she was forwarding me several of these emails.

125
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,920
And she actually sent me a text message and said,

126
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,920
please, please, would you thank everybody who sent something in.

127
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,920
I have one who's listening to the show.

128
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,920
She said, it really, really helps.

129
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,920
In particular, you know, I was thinking, originally when I saved this for the show,

130
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,920
I was thinking of reading this, this email that Brian sent.

131
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Brian from audioaditude.com.

132
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,920
I can't do it though because I know I won't get through it.

133
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,920
But what I found is that people would send in their own personal experiences,

134
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,920
sharing the grief because they understand it at a very deep emotional level.

135
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
And it's beautiful.

136
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,920
This is the kind of stuff that Tony Khan.

137
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
You remember Tony?

138
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,920
I'm sure he's still doing WGBH's morning stories.

139
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,920
I honestly have not listened in a long, long time.

140
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,920
And I haven't spoken to Tony in a long, long time.

141
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,920
But this is the kind of stuff that really turned him on.

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,920
And I gotta tell you, it makes me feel awesome.

143
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Awesome to know that even though the word friend is used so easily these days,

144
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,920
particularly in social networks, you know, be my friend.

145
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
I befriended you.

146
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Some of you guys really are friends.

147
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,920
In fact, probably all of you, even if you haven't called it,

148
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
I know you're on our side.

149
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
And again, thank you so much.

150
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
I really, really appreciate it.

151
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
And of course, I got tons of phone calls.

152
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Hi Adam, this is Nora.

153
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
One of your Italian friends.

154
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
I'm so sorry to hear about to your loss.

155
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
I feel for you.

156
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Just like, it took the wind out of you.

157
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
I would took the wind out of me.

158
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
I know a much of feel.

159
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,920
So you lose a pet or perhaps a family member.

160
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,920
I do feel having the same position.

161
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,920
My pet is health and strong, but like,

162
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,920
it's lost half in the past, and I know how much I feel.

163
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
So I'm sorry to happen.

164
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,920
You have all my sympathy and I'll make sure I'll send an email to Patricia.

165
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Bye.

166
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
I know.

167
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Luckily, it's time for me to let continue.

168
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
I know.

169
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
Yeah, indeed.

170
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
Here's the more.

171
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Yeah, okay.

172
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Indeed, life continues.

173
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
That's for sure.

174
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,920
And there were just scores and scores of similar voicemails.

175
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Very, very touching.

176
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
And we really appreciate it.

177
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,920
I think the girls buried Cindy had a nice ceremony.

178
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,920
And now we move on, but it takes time.

179
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
And I recognize these feelings.

180
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
It wasn't too long.

181
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
I lost my mom.

182
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Now, I don't want to compare the two necessarily.

183
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,920
But it's the same like just ripping your gut out type of feeling.

184
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
And there's other friends.

185
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,920
John C. Dvorak, who I did cranky geeks with yesterday.

186
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,920
And I had a lot of fun doing the show, by the way.

187
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,920
I think he kind of felt that I, you know,

188
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Look, it's obvious, you know, even though I'm up and I'm positive,

189
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
and I'm very excited about what's going on in the company.

190
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
We got some great shit going on.

191
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Absolutely great shit.

192
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Now, you can tell, of course it affects me a little bit.

193
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,920
And so what he did is he took me out to dinner last night.

194
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,920
But when you do that with John C. Dvorak, that's kind of an experience all to all unto itself.

195
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,920
And we wound up going to this place called Flair Deli in San Francisco.

196
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,920
They also have a restaurant in Vegas at Mandela Bay.

197
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,920
And they've got some other burger thing going on.

198
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,920
But this is like high, high, high class top quality cuisine and wine.

199
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,920
And man, you guys know, I'm a smoker, not a drinker.

200
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,920
And I did not, I did not know that I could drink so much wine and then,

201
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,920
wait, well, first it was a, what did we have?

202
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,920
A Pino, Pino, Grigio, maybe?

203
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
I don't know. It went from white.

204
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
It went to red.

205
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
It went to Medira.

206
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
There was an apple teeny somewhere in the middle.

207
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,920
But, you know, like really top-notch French cuisine,

208
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,920
you know, and really all of the Somalier, you know, and John,

209
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
that knows a lot about wine.

210
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
And I was just sitting there.

211
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
I just, I should have recorded that.

212
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
It was just like, listen to these guys bullshit each other.

213
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
But they really know what they're talking about.

214
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,920
And I'm just drinking it.

215
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,920
And I had, well, like popcorn with truffle on it.

216
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,920
It was like an explosion of the palate.

217
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
And it was good.

218
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,920
So we just shot the bowl, basically.

219
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,920
And I had some awesome food and awesome drink.

220
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,920
And I came back last night at, you know, as I was in at 10.

221
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
And I just went straight to bed.

222
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
And maybe that's part of why I woke up, you know,

223
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,920
all these foreign substances coursing through my veins.

224
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,920
So yesterday, of course, was the special apple announcement.

225
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
And, well, I'm very happy, I should say.

226
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Adam Richman, let's go here.

227
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
You're Wisconsin pilot.

228
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Call of from Dawn Andrews.

229
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Well, near back yard.

230
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Hey, it's September fifth.

231
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
And I was just listening to 658.

232
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,920
And let me tell you, you called it.

233
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Apple just announced a day that they're coming out with an iPod with a touch screen

234
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
and Wi-Fi access.

235
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Congratulations.

236
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
You had it nailed.

237
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,920
And, oh, by the way, they are dropping the prices of their eight gig.

238
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
I phoned down $200.

239
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,920
Does it get me out to buy one?

240
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,920
Not really, because I don't have that kind of disposable income.

241
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Your handle on the industry is just impeccable.

242
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,920
So, I hope your travels are going well.

243
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
And you're having a good time in San Francisco.

244
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,920
This is Richmond, Wisco, your Wisconsin pilot tailwinds.

245
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Hold it.

246
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Tailwinds indeed, my friend.

247
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Yeah, not only that, but it has the Safari browser.

248
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,920
It's kind of, it's, and to say that I called it or predicted it is going too far.

249
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
This was a wish list.

250
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
I'm like, please give me this.

251
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Thank you.

252
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Thank you.

253
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Yeah, I love it.

254
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,920
The details are still a little bit sketchy about what the device can do.

255
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,920
But this is the hacker's dream as far as I'm concerned.

256
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
This is a true web tablet.

257
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
I'm very excited.

258
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
And I'm not going to buy an iPhone.

259
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
No, no, no.

260
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
I'm going to wait until this iPod touch comes out.

261
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,920
I don't give a rat's ass about the iPod.

262
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,920
I want the Wi-Fi and the Safari browser.

263
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Because it has the fantastic quick time integration.

264
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
All of those MP4 videos.

265
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
All of them will play.

266
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
They'll play live right off the net.

267
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Our pod show channels look awesome and function perfectly in the Safari browser on the iPod touch.

268
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,920
This is, this is, really is.

269
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,920
It's a dream for me.

270
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,920
I wonder, since, you know, it pretty much is what I ask for is the iPhone without the phone.

271
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,920
So it looks like, you know, most of the stuff is in there.

272
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:58,920
I wonder if if they actually do not include the Bluetooth transceiver or if they would possibly

273
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,920
consider putting a proper, you know, Bluetooth transceiver that adheres to all the protocols in there.

274
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Because I wouldn't mind having my little iPod touch.

275
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
Excuse me.

276
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,920
That could talk to my cell phone regardless of what it is.

277
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
There's a lot of capabilities in Bluetooth.

278
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,920
You know, it could, it could manage my, my SIM card by remote.

279
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,920
You know, it can, it can handle the audio back and forth.

280
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,920
I mean, it could be, in essence, I could just get a cheap-ass phone to slip into my pocket

281
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,920
with a Bluetooth or maybe even into my bag.

282
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,920
And, and it would just communicate with the, with the iPod touch.

283
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
Doesn't matter.

284
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
There'll be tons of hacks and applications coming out.

285
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,920
I think it's the right direction to go for Apple.

286
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
I'm very, very happy.

287
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,920
A little bummed out that I, you know, I was expecting the,

288
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
and it's for sale right now.

289
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.

290
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,920
But wow, loving it, absolutely loving it.

291
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,920
And for those of you that, that call in on the, on, on the voice mail lines.

292
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,920
I, you know, just because your comment doesn't make it on the air.

293
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
It doesn't mean that I didn't hear it.

294
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
I listened to every single one.

295
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,920
But of course, if I actually put them all in the air,

296
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
that would be a show by itself.

297
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,920
You know, maybe there's a consideration here that I should just have a feedback channel.

298
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
That just runs.

299
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Hmm.

300
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
That would be something interesting to put together.

301
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Feedback channel.

302
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Okay.

303
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
And we'll mark that one down.

304
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,920
But, you know, once in a while, I get something,

305
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
even though it's a belated happy birthday at this point.

306
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
It was just so nice.

307
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
I, I just got to share it with you.

308
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Happy birthday.

309
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Happy birthday to you.

310
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Hello Adam.

311
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
It's me again, Terry.

312
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Or in Little Ren.

313
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,920
I wanted to take a moment and wish you a slightly belated happy birthday.

314
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Last year, you did something very special for me on my birthday.

315
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,920
A mere three weeks after your own.

316
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,920
You played a song by Amy Ayers at the request of my boyfriend.

317
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,920
That was very sweet and it meant the world to me.

318
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,920
For the last two years, you have enriched my life

319
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,920
by simply continuing to advance your endeavors in New Media.

320
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,920
I have become engrossed in this new medium.

321
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
And I love it very much.

322
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,920
I now have two shows over on Podshow.

323
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,920
And as you know, I'm working on my novel ASB for Podshow Press.

324
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,920
You inspire so many people to do something different.

325
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,920
And yet for me, you inspire a desire to do what I love.

326
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Every day.

327
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,920
Since the 80s, you have had an impact on my life in some form or another.

328
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,920
And for this, I sent you a heartfelt happy birthday.

329
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,920
And another sentiment from your listeners,

330
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,920
regarding your passing moment of weakness.

331
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,920
I personally look forward to the DSC whenever you put it out.

332
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,920
And the soundtrack to my life has become very pleasant.

333
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,920
Thanks to you bringing it to the forefront of my heart.

334
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Now, I'm not going to plug my shows.

335
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Just know that I proudly present them over at lrwh.podshow.com.

336
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:31,920
Although I'm still constructing it, it is wonderful to have everything in one place.

337
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Thank you for all that you do.

338
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,920
And as your birthday is rolled one into the other.

339
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,920
Take heart in the happiness that you really do bestow unto others.

340
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
It has been a pleasure.

341
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,920
And by the way, the naked pictures from last year might be a bit outdated.

342
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,920
So new ones are yours if you want them.

343
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,920
And yes, FYI, I am a fold.

344
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,920
Happy birthday Adam from Little Reds writing hood.

345
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Thank you.

346
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Of course me, Terry.

347
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
Yeah.

348
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Send them on.

349
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Please, out of mypodshow.com.

350
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,920
You know, that's a very nice birthday present.

351
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Whenever someone says you had an impact on my life,

352
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,920
holy crap, I think if someone said to me what is at the end at the end of this ride,

353
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
what do you want to be able to say?

354
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,920
I mean, it will definitely be that.

355
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,920
That I had an impact somewhere on someone's life.

356
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
So I guess I'm good to go now.

357
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Well, that, of course, and, you know, I love the fact that, you know,

358
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
I can't even say it.

359
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,920
I'm not going to go there.

360
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

361
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Hey, yeah, also a happy birthday to Natalie Dalcante.

362
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,920
She was her birthday just before mine.

363
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
Actually, just after Christina's just before mine.

364
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
I'm having dinner with her tonight.

365
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
That'll be fun.

366
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,920
And I'm just getting re-acquainted with everybody.

367
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
It's been almost three months.

368
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,920
It's been out here in, uh, in no Cal.

369
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,920
That's a curry condo.

370
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,920
And there's also a ton of new people who I haven't met and, uh,

371
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
I'm getting to know them.

372
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Gosh, I, I got to tell you,

373
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:24,920
when you see the new version of podshow.com and what it will do for you as an audience member,

374
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
in particular.

375
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,920
I mean, it's just imagine iTunes for the internet.

376
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,920
That's all I can really say because it's just no other way to explain it.

377
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
But what, what a great product.

378
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,920
I mean, it's something that, you know,

379
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
I'm really going to use.

380
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,920
It's kind of like, um, you know, when I was looking for the right set,

381
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:51,920
uh, to essentially have a, uh, a radio station studio in your laptop.

382
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,920
And I worked for months with the cast blaster mic on creating cast blaster,

383
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,920
which, of course, I still use to this day and recording the show on right now.

384
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Um, it's, it's very similar in field to what podshow.com is going to be.

385
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,920
And, uh, it's, it's, it's so vastly different from what we have now.

386
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
And there's nothing else like it out there.

387
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,920
That, that I know for sure. There's no thinking going on like this.

388
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
Um, it's so vastly different.

389
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,920
I think we're actually have to bring up a separate site, uh,

390
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,920
port everyone's data over and then maybe even, uh, work with,

391
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,920
you know, small groups initially because it's just, it's so different.

392
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,920
And, uh, it's, it's, it's different.

393
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Yeah, I think you've got to like it.

394
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,920
So, uh, let's see, uh, you know, we're still working on, uh,

395
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,920
the Lost Elvis Diaries, which, uh, it's going to be a couple months,

396
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
yet until, uh, until the production is done.

397
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
And when we actually start rolling out the episodes,

398
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,920
this is, uh, you know, uh, the Elvis's life in, uh, in diary form.

399
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,920
And, uh, I told you that for the production,

400
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I was looking for a younger sounding Elvis.

401
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
And, uh, so far only one submission.

402
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,920
I thought we would do a little better than that.

403
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Uh, how long was the curve?

404
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Uh, what is he was looking for?

405
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,920
A younger Elvis will, I think, in the mind, um,

406
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Mr. Kerr, uh, I believe that I've got what it takes and,

407
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,920
and well, I just, I just do, you know,

408
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,920
with my mom and I, she really didn't see what had been meaning.

409
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,920
I mean, I, I miss her a lot.

410
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,920
So, Mr. Kerr, if, if I'm your man, uh, at the end of this,

411
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
I'll give you a phone number to call.

412
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,920
I don't know. I don't know if this is the guy.

413
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Maybe you can do a better, uh, younger Elvis.

414
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
We're looking. We're casting.

415
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,920
And before we have to resort to putting it on Craigslist, uh,

416
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
here's your chance right now.

417
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Ah, you know what? I haven't done this in a while.

418
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Let's, uh, let's play that horrible voicemail jingle.

419
00:21:48,920 --> 00:22:03,920
And I'm a streamer.

420
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Hey, I'm a streamer from hoddye.com.

421
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,920
And I have a really quick question regarding the podcasting

422
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,920
and new media expo in Ontario, California, uh,

423
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
coming up at the end of this month.

424
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,920
I'm just wondering, what does it benefit

425
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,920
in independent podcasts or such as myself, um,

426
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,920
especially in hip hop to attend and event like that, uh,

427
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,920
aside from maybe making a couple connections and seeing a bunch of

428
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,920
USB microphones, I could give a shit less about.

429
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Really, why would I go?

430
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,920
I mean, it is a really that much to get out of networking at this event.

431
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Um, and is there anything else I'm missing aside from the whole,

432
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,920
you know, I know you can do the, you pay the 300 bucks

433
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,920
and you get the whole educational workshops and all that shit.

434
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Let's say you don't have the money for that.

435
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Should I even bother going?

436
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
Let me know, man, I appreciate what you think.

437
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Um, and, um, I hope you had a great labor day.

438
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Talk to you soon.

439
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Yo.

440
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
J-Mac.

441
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
J-Mac actually sends something with, uh,

442
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
with major, which I'm going to play tomorrow on the football

443
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Friday edition of the show.

444
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Which will be done on Friday.

445
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Here we go.

446
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
I can hear the nylon just saying now.

447
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Here we go.

448
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
We're promising.

449
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
It's going to under the liver.

450
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Yeah, that's, that's a good question.

451
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Well, this is, I think, year three for the portable media

452
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,920
expo sometimes also, uh,

453
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
misnamed the podcast expo.

454
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Uh, the first year, uh, we, uh,

455
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
uh, so to answer your question directly,

456
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:36,920
I see no value for myself as in my position at pod show.

457
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,920
We see no value, uh, for pod show to do much there.

458
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,920
And we've actually never done anything there besides, uh,

459
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,920
the other part, which I do think has value is hanging out and, uh,

460
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
and networking, which, uh, you know,

461
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
that's kind of what all conferences are to me.

462
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
You know, I, I, I go to conferences not a lot.

463
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Uh, I don't like speaking at them.

464
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
I don't like participating in them.

465
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
I don't really even like sponsoring them, uh,

466
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,920
because the benefit is usually for the, uh,

467
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
organizer of the, uh, of the conference.

468
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Which is fine.

469
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
That's, uh, that's a fantastic business.

470
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,920
So, uh, you know, it's pretty much the same,

471
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,920
uh, the same kind of tracks, if you will,

472
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,920
and indeed, uh, that I don't think it would be,

473
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,920
you know, a lot of the fact that I get to see people who I only hear or see,

474
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,920
uh, on video or, you know, just to, to be there to hang out and, uh,

475
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,920
to be there and hang out essentially.

476
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
That's always a good thing.

477
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,920
And I don't think you can put a price on that.

478
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Um, and we just had this discussion, uh, yesterday with, uh,

479
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
with Richard Brewer, hey, you know,

480
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,920
you will, and indeed, uh, that I don't think it would be useful, uh,

481
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,920
for you, uh, Jane Mack, because, you know, you're, you're kind of rolling.

482
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
And I think a lot of this is where people who are.

483
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,920
It's, it, it's kind of a, it's like a blogger conference,

484
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,920
you know, a, um, and I think with most blogger conferences,

485
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,920
it's, uh, you really, you know, what people take away from it from, uh,

486
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,920
you know, what, what, what the media they create out of it is probably the most interesting.

487
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,920
And that's usually just, uh, people hanging out and getting together.

488
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,920
It's also, it feels very much like Ash-Kosh, you know, for pilots, you know,

489
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,920
what is the point of going to Ash-Kosh? Well, you have to go, you know,

490
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
and it's on my list.

491
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,920
Um, it, uh, will anything, is it any real reason?

492
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,920
No, because I just want to hang out and kick some tires.

493
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
It's like hang or talk.

494
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,920
So, um, and I'm, by the way, I do want to come this year.

495
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,920
And, and the reason is because I know who's showing up,

496
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920
and I just want to see these people.

497
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
I want to hug some people.

498
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,920
I want to say hi and hang out.

499
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,920
Generally, uh, there's, there's not much else that, uh,

500
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,920
that I can see that, uh, being useful for.

501
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Um, next year, I think they're going to move, uh, to, uh,

502
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,920
a much bigger venue in Vegas.

503
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
You know, now you're talking, you know,

504
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,920
there's always a reason to go to Vegas.

505
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,920
All right, uh, one more song that I got for you.

506
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
This is from the Podsake music.

507
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,920
Now, where this is, um, from the Nigel pace, you know,

508
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Nigel is, uh, I'd say probably the best example of, uh,

509
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,920
what an independent promoter in the radio business is.

510
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
He is to podcasting.

511
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Boy, this guy knows how to promote stuff.

512
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,920
And, uh, he has a, uh, he got a track up on the Podsake music

513
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
network from, uh, Journey South.

514
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Uh, Journey South are, uh, let me see.

515
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,920
So, first of all, their album is coming out in the UK on the 15th of October.

516
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,920
I just really want to read this because he sent me another email about it,

517
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,920
and I really want, I think they were, uh, what were they?

518
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,920
T-to-to-to-to-to-to...

519
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Yeah, okay, so Journey South, they were finalists on, uh, on the X factor.

520
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
A couple years back.

521
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,920
It can only be two or three, I think.

522
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,920
And, uh, so I guess they got a record deal.

523
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
And, uh, it's not bad.

524
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,920
So, uh, what the heck?

525
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,920
It's, uh, very appropriate, by the way, for my, uh, trip.

526
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,320
It's journey south and what I love about home.

527
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,920
I'm down, and silence in my country side.

528
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,920
That's what I love about home.

529
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,920
I'm out on the road now, now the place we're all face past goodbye.

530
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Stay out the window thinking back to where I sit goodbye.

531
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:03,920
We're done trying to picture all of the people I know.

532
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,920
There what I love about home.

533
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,120
Oh, there's a place where I feel I belong

534
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,520
Tell that the end of the room, we're on top

535
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,920
Close with our bodies, I'm on run away

536
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,320
Oh, my life, let's wear our skin

537
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:38,320
Come on, my wife, I'm on our way back now

538
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,920
That my mom's upset is just warm up to go

539
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,400
I get this thing feeling, we feel

540
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,880
And you're dead's as there's a love

541
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,280
So you know where

542
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,160

543
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,660
You're always welcome to stay

That's what I love about her

545
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,660
All these places that I feel I belong

546
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:14,160
Tell that the end of you will be wrapped up

547
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,660
