So many amazes.

168
00:04:38,420 --> 00:05:08,120
We got a crisis going on over here. I don't know if you've followed on the news by now is probably spread around the globe that

169
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:15,120
we have severe flooding throughout the United Kingdom. Mainly in the north that is now really spread to the Midlands.

170
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:22,120
England as we've called Wales and now even to parts of the southeast. Yes, even London is witnessing this.

171
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Let me tell you Friday morning. Of course, the whole day started off food barred as it would on a Friday just by this horrible, horrible weather.

172
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:40,120
In the M25 flooded there were the M40, not that I have to travel over that but just giving an example. People were stuck for seven hours in traffic.

173
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:47,120
We have water plants closing because they've been contaminated by flooding. We have power station shutting down. It's pretty damn bad here.

174
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:55,120
It really is already insurer saying it's going to cost 2 billion pounds. That's 4 billion dollars or a week in Iraq.

175
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:10,120
It's just unbelievable what's going on. I know I predicted good weather for this week. I'm not going to revise that I will say we're not going to see such a dumping of rain like we've seen over the past two to three days really.

176
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:16,120
It was just horrible. I actually took the train in avoiding the highways.

177
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Trains were slowed down. They couldn't go as fast because of the accumulation of water.

178
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,120
I think I was also something about slippery tracks. I'm not quite sure. It was difficult getting into town.

179
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Town was heavy, heavy traffic. There was just tons to do.

180
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Boom, boom, boom, boom, meeting after meeting. That's some fascinating people who will be starting some shows with.

181
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:48,120
If you've ever heard of the medium Gordon Smith, I had a great great meeting with him also the barefoot doctor who actually, you know,

182
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:55,120
if we're going to do a show with someone who calls himself the barefoot doctor and says he can cure you just by, you know, by using his hands.

183
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:05,120
I'm like, shit, cure me, baby. You know, remember, I don't know if a long time listeners were recall that I once fell asleep on an airplane.

184
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:13,120
American Airlines going from, let me think. I think it was maybe Los Angeles or San Francisco to Miami.

185
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Maybe it was New York to Miami. And I fell asleep on my, on the palm of my hand and really messed up a nerve.

186
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,120
The result is that for the past two and a half years, you know, my left index finger is just a tiny bit numb.

187
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:36,120
And the barefoot doctor said, hold on a second. He, he jammed his finger into me into my back. That would be.

188
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:44,120
And really pushed it quite deep. And he said, look, within 48 hours, you'll notice a difference. I got to tell you, it's almost gone.

189
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:51,120
I mean, it's like two and a half years and hundreds and hundreds of pounds in physical therapy and low and behold.

190
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Anyway, so we had a board meeting started 6 p.m. on so I didn't have time in the morning to do a show.

191
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,120
This is all leading up to a huge apology, obviously.

192
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,120
We had a board of directors meeting in San Francisco, which started at 10 a.m. 6 p.m. in London.

193
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,120
And that really lasted until, well, well, past 10 o'clock.

194
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:20,120
And, you know, I got home. I was so tired. It's been two, but maybe even three really, really long weeks.

195
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,120
It's, I was dead. And, you know, I took the advice that I should have taken last weekend. You guys said, screw it.

196
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Don't do your show on Saturday or Sunday. Relax. I couldn't go flying or anything fun like that.

197
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:42,120
But there was something that I received on Friday from Head Sales Weasel, Chris Jacob. He brought for me an iPhone.

198
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,120
Yes, I have been assimilated.

199
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,120
And, uh, I've been playing with this device all weekend long, nonstop.

200
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Setting up my entire environment to conform to it because, of course, there's a little bit different than working with the trustee, uh,

201
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Nokia E61I because you're right back into the, the throws of iTunes and I really haven't used iTunes very much at all.

202
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,120
If at all, even on this computer. Um, so I'm back to sinking.

203
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Over the course of, uh, the next few days, over the course of the week, I'll be telling you about my experiences. The first thing I did though, um,

204
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:25,120
you know, I knew that I did not want to have yet another AT&T account. I have a singular wireless account,

205
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,120
which, uh, you know, I've been moving that SIM card back and forth from every single Nokia phone that I've had.

206
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:37,120
In fact, it started out with my blackberry, which you remember how much I love that device. I really did.

207
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:45,120
And, uh, I was looking around that I found at hacktheiPhone.com. I found a procedure that enables you to, um,

208
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,120
insert any AT&T compatible SIM card, meaning that I could, because that's really all I want us to do.

209
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:59,120
You know, I want to test the phone out. I don't want to completely commit to it. Now, by changing my number, I'd say that's a pretty big damn commitment.

210
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,120
So, even though I'm an AT&T customer, you can't just put a different SIM card in immediately. It'll say, no, no good.

211
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Uh, please put in a compatible, you know, please put in the SIM card that came with the phone.

212
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,120
You've got to go through the activation process. And, of course, this activation process takes place through iTunes.

213
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:23,120
So, uh, because of iTunes lives on the local computer, you know, lots of, uh, engineers and, well, you can call them hackers if you want.

214
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:31,120
Um, you know, have a way to track and see what communication is going on between the computer and the iPod, even though they really haven't been able to get into the iPod.

215
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:39,120
And so, uh, essentially, you load a program that acts like iTunes and routes around it, you know, there's some interesting steps where you, um,

216
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:47,120
have to click restore, then unplug the, uh, the iPhone from your computer quick before iTunes is able to recognize it's, uh, it's gone.

217
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Um, and it works. If I can work, first time off. So, I inserted my, uh, my singular one, uh, SIM card and presto, my, my number and even in iTunes, it says, here's your number.

218
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:11,120
So, that was great. And, of course, I've been following along on the, uh, on the iPhone, on an iPhone mod, uh, IRC channels to see the, the progress, you know, obviously whatever one wants is to unlock the phone.

219
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,120
So, you could put in any SIM card from any network. I could take quite a while. It's not, it's not a trivial exercise.

220
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:27,120
And I think a lot of that information usually comes out after it's been leaked from one of the factories probably, um, that, you know, information just has a way of flowing in that regard.

221
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Um, but for right now, I'm, I'm happy just, uh, just testing another, you know, so here's the one thing I've got to say right off the bat.

222
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:44,120
They have figured something very important out. The whole idea, and I, and I went back actually, and I, I looked at Steve Jobs's keynote where he announced the iPhone.

223
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:52,120
And he was talking about the, the internet navigation device. And yes, as an internet navigation device, I have to say it is outstanding.

224
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,120
And the main reason is because, um, you're not looking at what Steve Jobs calls the baby web.

225
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,120
When you load a web page, you can see the entire page in the browser and you can, you know, double tap to zoom in,

226
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,120
or you can use the pinch finger, move to zoom into where you want to be.

227
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,120
And it's incredibly important. It's not just a trick, you know, the Nokia.

228
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:31,120
So let me just step back for a second. So, you know, we are used to seeing web pages in context. So we understand almost instantaneously, you know, what's the layout, where's the information, what's the navigation structure, except, of course, with Pacho.com.

229
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Working on sucking lesson that regard.

230
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Having that knowledge then allows you to navigate through the rest of the site.

231
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:47,120
When it comes in all, you know, stuff on top and, you know, one big long strip of information, you know, what that looks like right in your cell phone,

232
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,120
where you get the, the side bars, the first thing you have to scroll all the way through, you know, you lose your whole context of information.

233
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Now, in the East 61 eye the way they solve that is they have a little mini map.

234
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,120
And so when you really start to scroll, you then see the whole page in this kind of mini map that is off to the side.

235
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:11,120
So it does give you some context as to where you are in, in navigating throughout this page because let's face it, you're scrolling, so you're navigating.

236
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Brilliant, brilliant the way they've solved that absolutely make so much sense.

237
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:26,120
And this screen, they, I don't know if these guys are actually making money on the iPhone because this screen is of outstanding quality, of course, a lot of it.

238
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:40,120
There's the courts, technology stuff that they already had figured out in, in OS 10, but, um, man, wow, the, the browsing experience is utterly, utterly fantastic.

239
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Now I don't know about battery life yet, you know, I've run it down a couple times already, which is not so surprising.

240
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,120
I'm putting it on an extended long charge now, I ran it all the way down because, you know, batteries do develop some kind of memory.

241
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,120
If you recharge them halfway through and you do that too often.

242
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:05,120
Yeah, I, you know, I was very ready to hate this, extremely, and I didn't get it for free.

243
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,120
I paid for at least Chris paid for, I got to pay him back.

244
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,120
I was really prepared to not like this at all.

245
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Now, once I've gotten around some of the ugly things, which is pretty traditional for, for Macintosh, you know, out of the box, it works great for everybody.

246
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:29,120
And if you want it to perform, you know, in a, in a way that would be consistent with a machine that is a bit more open, then you have to hack stuff around.

247
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,120
I think that's kind of the Mac way.

248
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,120
So, so far so good, I'm given it the thumbs up at the moment.

249
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:44,120
And I just saw that, that apparently they've gotten into the OS into the file system, so we're close to something.

250
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Yeah, it wouldn't be cool if you couldn't SSH into your, into your iPhone.

251
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Just the FTP in drops them stuff off.

252
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Man, if we can really get in, if we can really load a shell, it's going to become a very, very important device.

253
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,120
One more thing I want to say about it, their integration of QuickTime is really stellar.

254
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,120
I've been messing around with that, because of course, I'm highly interested.

255
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,120
You know, QuickTime is, it's not as prevalent as flash on most computers.

256
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,120
But what wouldn't it be amazing if QuickTime turned out to be the mobile format?

257
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
And of course, it's not a format.

258
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,120
It's really, it's a, it's a container to be quite honest.

259
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,120
They do have formats within that, but you know, can also be H.264.

260
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,120
And so I have QuickTime video in it, but it just works so beautifully.

261
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,120
I think every MP3 link you click on it plays.

262
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Most MP4 links definitely all MOV linked or almost all.

263
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,120
I mean, there's some weirdness is to what formats it will accept.

264
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,120
I got to get some information on that.

265
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
But it just works.

266
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,120
In fact, I even tried out, I watched the Steve Jobs keynote.

267
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:56,120
I went to the Apple site, went to QuickTime, went to Keynotes and events, clicked on the, on the,

268
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,120
was it the developers conference, I think.

269
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,120
And, and it played it.

270
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,120
It's streamed the QuickTime video right into my iPhone.

271
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,120
Got to tell you extremely impressed.

272
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Adam, good afternoon.

273
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
It's you.

274
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:25,120
I am calling to prove once and for all that someone actually, we've got articles in playboy.

275
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:33,120
I got a script for years and years ago and claimed it was purely, you know, for the free speech stuff

276
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,120
and the first amendment promotion and all things and articles and all that stuff.

277
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:48,120
But finally, it's, you know, it's living proof because this current issue has this tremendous article about new media and stuff.

278
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:59,120
And in this nice little graphic of a big column of logos of sort of web to .0 or a new media company, the pod safety and user network logo,

279
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:08,120
right at the top of the entire column over YouTube and overall these other big, big, huge, well known names.

280
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,120
And the first person quoted in article is Ron Bloom.

281
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Very nice.

282
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:21,120
So I don't know if you caught that using your ego filter or vanity filter, or if it is used and checked for news about stuff on the web.

283
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
But, uh, awesome piece.

284
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Really terrific exposure for a pod show.

285
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,120
And, uh, well, of course, it would be exposure for anybody who had the articles in playboy.

286
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,120
But anyway, uh, how about a great great weekend and, uh, photo, uh, continuing to hear the shows.

287
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
Talk to you.

288
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Bye bye.

289
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
Oh, Shabbat Shalom, my friend.

290
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Yeah.

291
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,120
Are you and Mark Yoshimotan Mkov, the only people who pointed that out, of course, I had seen it already.

292
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Away with those one more someone sent me a, no, that was, I think, Mkov sent me a scan of it.

293
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
Uh, yeah.

294
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Yeah.

295
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Absolutely.

296
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
I remember being interviewed.

297
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
I was on the call too.

298
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
They didn't quote me though.

299
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
I guess I'm completely uncoordable.

300
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
But I believe it.

301
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
I believe it does work, man.

302
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Once again, this weekend, uh, we had Dr. Cockney featured in the news of the world that humongous

303
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,120
newspaper here in, uh, in the UK, 9 million readers only comes out on Sunday and people say

304
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,120
they bite for the sports, but it's just filled with naked chicks, which is kind of the culture

305
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
here in the UK.

306
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,120
So it's not like a smart, well, yeah, it is smarty.

307
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,120
But, uh, Dr. Cockney fits in just perfectly out half to say.

308
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,120
And man, boom, download requests through the roof, registrations through the roof, um, you know,

309
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
people pay attention to that stuff.

310
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
They, they do read the articles.

311
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,120
In this case, they take the, you know, they take all the steps to actually go over to

312
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,120
website, you know, then go into another website and play something.

313
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
It works.

314
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Al-Warring, right, our front, I'm going to go long today because there's been so much

315
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,120
response to, uh, to the trickery of television.

316
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Of course, that's where we left off, uh, with the 637, where I went through that

317
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,120
interview with Michael Grayton, David Cox, uh, some great feedbacks and great examples of

318
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,120
things that people have witnessed themselves when it comes to, uh, media deception.

319
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,120
You know, nothing earthshattering, but some great, some fun things to listen to for

320
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
sure.

321
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,120
And, uh, so I just got so many.

322
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,120
I just want to rush through the, you just bang out a couple.

323
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,120
Also, today is the day of the cheddar, uh, if all goes according to plan and I think

324
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,120
it will, uh, somewhere near the end of our day in the United Kingdom will be releasing

325
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,120
the new channel editor functionality at podshow.com, which will enable you to determine the

326
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,120
output of your channel feeds, how they play.

327
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
And, and, you know, I've been playing with this iPhone already.

328
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,120
I have yet another, another play out in mind is to how I want stuff, uh, to be made

329
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
available.

330
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Because that's really one of the big differences you'll see is now as an audience member,

331
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,120
you can go to anyone's channel and decide how you want to listen to it.

332
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,120
You just want to play it in the dashboard, click play channel, boom, it'll play.

333
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,120
You want to play it in real or Windows media or wind amp, no problem.

334
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
We've got options for those.

335
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Want to put it on your iPod through iTunes, no problem.

336
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Got an option for that.

337
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,120
Do you want to just download it? No problem.

338
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
Got an option for that.

339
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Do you want the RSS fee?

340
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
No problem.

341
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
There's the icon.

342
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Yep.

343
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,120
So let me just, this is actually left over from, from Thursday, just a couple of

344
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,120
quick blurbs on channels since it's coming out today.

345
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Hey, I just want to share channels for the nylon and anyone else is still

346
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
doesn't get it.

347
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
And if I'm not right about this, you're not going to play this.

348
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,120
I'm just going to assume I know what I'm talking about.

349
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,120
And even if I don't, I don't know.

350
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,120
He said he doesn't need channels because your already has iTunes, which he thinks does the same thing.

351
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,120
But it's not just playlists.

352
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
It's smart playlists.

353
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
And iTunes, there's smart playlists.

354
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:49,120
You can set them up according to any combination of albums and artists and podcasts and banks.

355
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,120
You know, now that I've been using iTunes again, it is very much like smart playlists.

356
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Oh boy, is it?

357
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Except they're Uber, smart.

358
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
Uber, smart.

359
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Because you put shows in and shows, there's your serendipity factor.

360
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,120
They pop out episodes and you never know when it's going to come.

361
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
You never know what's going to be in it.

362
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Oh, man.

363
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
Yes, yes.

364
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Or yeah.

365
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
And this is the last bit of functionality I'm waiting on.

366
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
You can put channels into channels.

367
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Can you imagine how much cool stuff is going to happen to your smart playlists?

368
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
Quite a bit.

369
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:28,120
So, that's more of what channels are, but if you've done much with smart playlists,

370
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,120
you know, that you can base them on other smart playlists.

371
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:42,120
So, you're really sharing your iTunes playlists and sharing it.

372
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:49,120
And you're losing your getting other people smart playlists.

373
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:56,120
And then you get the channels within channels, which is, you can base your smart playlists

374
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,120
to other people smart playlists, which is, yes.

375
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Yes, I guess that's a big thing.

376
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
That is.

377
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
Oh, my help.

378
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Thanks, man.

379
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
That's absolutely right.

380
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,120
That's exactly how it's supposed to work.

381
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,120
And I must say, great explanation for someone who's never actually used it.

382
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:24,120
I'm so happy because, you know, I keep comparing this to how tough it is to explain Tvo.

383
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,120
And you can't really understand it until you use it.

384
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
And it's the same thing.

385
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,120
So, having this level of understanding without having used it, thank you.

386
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
I applaud that.

387
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Hey, Adam.

388
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
This is Chris and Philadelphia.

389
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,120
Let me sum up my previous two long comment.

390
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,120
It's about two things, the first is the magical player for podcasts.

391
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,120
I think it would be some sort of program that fits on a portable device.

392
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Like, at any hundred in the iPhone, not my palm, but that is not so good.

393
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
That, you know, it can sink.

394
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,120
It can download all the stuff on the go.

395
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
And let me see back.

396
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Let me have it to a shared field.

397
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
Let me get it put in the channel.

398
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
Let me rate it.

399
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Share it with my friends.

400
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
I like that.

401
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Yeah, I'm down with that.

402
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,120
And we'll have some of that functionality in our channels.

403
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,120
Although I am moving away from the download synchronized part.

404
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,120
I can just see where we're going.

405
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
And not that we're not going to need this for a long time.

406
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,120
But eventually, bandwidth and connectivity will just be so prevalent.

407
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,120
You'll be able to, you know, stream stuff live from anywhere uninterrupted.

408
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
I'm pretty convinced of that.

409
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Maybe five years from now, so we have some download synchronization things we need to do.

410
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
And yes, over the air.

411
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,120
But please, let's keep it broadband over the air.

412
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,120
Because it's a bad experience doing that over a mobile network.

413
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,120
It could also be a very expensive experience.

414
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
I want to see.

415
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,120
So hopefully some get on that for the iPhone for any hundred and stuff.

416
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,120
And second, the chatter sounds awesome.

417
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,120
It's exactly what the future media is.

418
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,120
Like everyone have their own little feeds and stuff getting passed around.

419
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,120
One of the problems with with iTunes and channels is that, you know, it sticks all

420
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
of shows in the one list.

421
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,120
Is it possible to use OKML in this format?

422
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,120
I know that OKML is like, you know, a listing of RSS feeds.

423
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,120
So I would like to really like, I nested list of RSS feeds in ID.

424
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
I'd have my basic channel.

425
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
Click on it.

426
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,120
It opens up two more listings, two more directories, I guess.

427
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,120
And there's my, you know, electricity podcast.

428
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
And there's my daily source code.

429
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,120
You know, that would be excellent.

430
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
That's that you're talking about change in iTunes.

431
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
You're talking about change in a lot there.

432
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
But it's just something to think about.

433
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
So keep up the good work piece.

434
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
Yeah, man, thank you.

435
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,120
Now, the reason I played this rather geeky comment is multiple reasons.

436
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:50,120
First of all, I want to point out that we do have an OPML important export feature.

437
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,120
I don't know if it's working properly at this moment.

438
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
The spec has changed.

439
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
A lot of stuff has changed.

440
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Support probably waned a bit for it because very few people actually wanted.

441
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,120
But I might as well say right off the bat and right now that the entire cheddar concept,

442
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,120
not the editor per se and not the playout system.

443
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,120
The idea of OPML and RSS feeds is completely modeled after what Dave Winner built.

444
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Of course, Dave Winner found RSS co-founder of RSS and definitely the founder of OPML.

445
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,120
It is if you've looked at share my OPML and reading list,

446
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,120
it is exactly this concept taken a bit further by being able to determine the output.

447
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,120
And these are the things that as a user of the OPML editor,

448
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
I was always looking for.

449
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
It's like, okay, you know,

450
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
and I just didn't know how to do it.

451
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Otherwise, you know, the platform is certainly open enough to hack around.

452
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,120
But I'd like the idea of a reading list.

453
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,120
But I wanted more control over the output because that then makes me a publisher,

454
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,120
not just a collector with some, you know, standard based output of my feed.

455
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
So I want people to be able to enjoy it.

456
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,120
And I want to have some form of editorial control,

457
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
which doesn't mean actually writing something.

458
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
But determining what comes out of the feed,

459
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
filter certain feeds,

460
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,120
you know, really using it as an information router.

461
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,120
So I might as well give Dave props right away before,

462
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,120
there's some problem of who invented what.

463
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
It doesn't matter.

464
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
I just want to be able to,

465
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
I want to be able to use this for myself.

466
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
I want to be able to control what pictures,

467
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
what MP3s,

468
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,120
what shows, what goes onto my iPod.

469
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,120
And, you know, with the channel,

470
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,120
and if you go to Adam.podshow.com,

471
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
you'll see that I already created an iPhone channel.

472
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Right now, there's only one show in there.

473
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
It's a twit.

474
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
And, of course, it's not, you know,

475
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
it's displaying multiple episodes.

476
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
So it hasn't been edited with cheddar yet.

477
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
But when it is, boy, I'm telling you,

478
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
I'm going to give you so much cool shit to listen to.

479
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
And you're going to be given it back.

480
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,120
Just do a search on your favorite word of the day

481
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
for under channels at podshow.com.

482
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,120
You'll see what I'm talking about.

483
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,120
So you think, you know, your rock history, huh?

484
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Well, tell me this.

485
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Who was the original vocalist for ACBC?

486
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
Wrong.

487
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,120
It was Dave Evans.

488
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
And Dave and his band,

489
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
the bad asses,

490
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,120
have a brand new CD out called Center.

491
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
Dave, his management,

492
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
and his record label,

493
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
have given podshow radio the right

494
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120

Yeah, Adam.

516
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Keith from Vancouver BC.

517
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,120
I failed compelled to send in the comment.

518
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,120
Just finished listening to DSC632

519
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,120
and had opening track was outstanding.

520
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
I had a pretty good day today

521
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,120
and when I heard that track had put me into

522
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
an even better mood on the way to Ikido.

523
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
When I got home,

524
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
went straight to iTunes and bought it.

525
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
The PMMemnet gets finest.

526
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,120
PS.

527
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
I wanted to do I'm not here to comment,

528
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
but my wife is asleep beside me,

529
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
so I did this up on my neck.

530
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Ciao for now.

531
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Red pill.

532
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Fulder.

533
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,120
I didn't sound the half bad actually.

534
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,120
That was pretty good.

535
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,120
I did not sound half bad at all.

536
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
I like that.

537
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
If I came out of your Mac,

538
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
dude, that's pretty, this got in a lot better.

539
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
That speech since this.

540
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
DSC632.

541
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
So that was Valley Lodge hanging on.

542
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Yeah, fantastic track.

543
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
I love those guys.

544
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,120
They kind of like a Casey in the Sunshine Band

545
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
upside down in backwards.

546
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,120
So I'm going to launch into this whole thing

547
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,120
about the BBC since I got so many great comments.

548
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
People giving examples of how they were part of

549
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
mainstream media deception.

550
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,120
But before that, something I've got to play

551
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,120
you from the Pod Safe Music Network.

552
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
I believe Jersey Todd sent this into me

553
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,120
as something to play on the Fubar Friday.

554
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
You're going to love it because the kleptones

555
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,120
know the revolution.

556
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,120
It will be televised if you're a blue pill taker.

557
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,120
Ladies and gentlemen, our future.

558
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,120
You will choose to stay at home, brother.

559
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,120
For you'll be able to do everything you need

560
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
from your potato couch.

561
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,120
You'll be able to don your virtual helmet

562
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,120
and experience the revolution on 360

563
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,120
degree around CGI.

564
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
You may choose to view as manga

565
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,120
or Hannah Barbera as the hair bear bunch

566
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,120
because a revolution will be televised.

567
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
The revolution will be brought to you

568
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
by Apple Mac or PC World

569
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,120
with Nokia and Motorola providing

570
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
SMS updates.

571
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,120
The revolution will show pictures of

572
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,120
hopefuls, cueing overnight for the latest

573
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
audition.

574
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,120
The revolution will be sponsored by

575
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Gown, the cocky and camel collection.

576
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,120
And it will storm me as you.

577
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,120
You will play yourself or run pit playing

578
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
you.

579
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Or you.

580
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
Playing grind pit.

581
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,120
Playing you.

582
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
The revolution will be smoked.

583
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
Snorled.

584
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Injected.

585
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Chased on vaporized.

586
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,120
It will be recorded on mini-dv

587
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
and kept in the puppet.

588
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
The revolution will be digitized.

589
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Then transferred to all available formats.

590
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
It will appear on your favorite CD

591
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
as the bonus track.

592
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,120
You'll be able to procure it cheap on VHS.

593
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,120
Or pay a little bit more for the extra footage on DVD.

594
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Met a max will be available for the old school.

595
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Who are more good shooting comes you

596
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
with the shelters and grips.

597
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,120
The revolution will shoot from the hip hip hip hip.

598
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,120
I used to say

599
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
I...

600
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
I...

601
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
I used to...

602
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,120
The revolution will be scratched.

603
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
It will be spun back and suffered as a loop.

604
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,120
It will appear as the red button on your remote control.

605
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,120
The revolution will operate in a job share.

606
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
Or flexi time option.

607
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
It's so you can have it at your leisure.

608
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,120
Because the revolution will be ticked.

609
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
The revolution will be burned.

610
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
Highlight it in scent.

611
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
It will have its own awards ceremony.

612
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
With the biggest winners unable to attend.

613
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Except for via live satellite link.

614
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Because of their current revolutionary commitments.

615
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,120
The revolution will be a tick up in a storm.

616
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Or a bottle in a message.

617
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
Or a door to a key.

618
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,120
The revolution will always come with fries.

619
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,120
Because the revolution will be televised.

620
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,120
The revolution will be hard, my brothers.

621
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Because it will use via gra.

622
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Come a gra.

623
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Arroll tight and hardening of the arteries.

624
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
In order to fill inside.

625
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Rumbles happy meal box.

626
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
As the free gift.

627
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,120
The revolution will have a new twist.

628
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,120
Sponsored by Levi.

629
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,120
With a sticker campaign written in an eligible graffiti style font.

630
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Because the revolution will be advertised.

631
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,120
And paper view will have a whole new meaning, brothers.

632
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,120
The revolution will be available for gameboy this fall.

633
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,120
And Xbox and GameCube today.

634
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,120
The revolution will be televised.

635
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
We'll be televised.

636
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,120
We'll be televised brothers.

637
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,120
Because the revolution is alive.

638
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
Yeah.

639
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,120
It's common sense.

640
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,120
We go have Yasi Claire.

641
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,120
Good bye.

642
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,120
It's real hip hop music from the Soya.

643
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Yeah.

644
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Say it.

645
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Yeah.

646
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
I know you're out there.

647
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
I can feel you now.

648
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
I know that you're afraid.

649
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,120
You're afraid of us.

650
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,120
You're afraid of change.

651
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
I don't know the future.

652
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,120
I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end.

653
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,120
They came here to tell you how it's going to begin.

654
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
I'm going to hang up this phone.

655
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,120
And then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.

656
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,120
I'm going to show them more.

657
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Without you.

658
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,120
A world without rules and controls.

659
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Without borders or boundaries.

660
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,120
A world.

661
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
But anything is possible.

662
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,120
Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.

663
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:30,120
You may think it's a lot of old cockman, but that's your hangover.

664
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
You bastard.

665
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
Right.

666
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Supercalipraginistic spirality doso.

667
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,120
Thank you, if you seem to have a son or a son.

668
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,120
If you don't say it, you'll have a success.

669
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Supercalipraginistic spirality doso.

670
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,120
Remember that three years ago,

671
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,120
you had to return.

672
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
You spent your children.

673
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,120
You didn't want to tell me what's going to end.

674
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Supercalipraginistic spirality doso.

675
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,120
Supercalipraginistic spirality doso.

676
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Supercalipraginistic spirality doso.

677
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Supercalipraginistic spirality doso.

678
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:19,120
No, of course that wasn't pod save.

679
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:26,960
No, it wasn't sending by Jersey Todd Kenneth for Burrach sent in a Gmail atom fastening shows again lately

680
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,440
concerning the TV deception stuff, maybe track 20 at the kleptones that I've humble

681
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,520
with all put that link in the show notes could be an interesting piece of music

682
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
a tie into the show.

683
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,000
No idea if it's really pod save, but they do offer it as a DM DRM free download, yeah.

684
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,760
No, I would guess that's not pod save, particularly with Michael Jackson's Ben track

685
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
on there.

686
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,920
No, no, don't think so, but the whole point is well taken, the revolution, if you see

687
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,680
the revolution televised, be very aware of my friends, you're in the blue pill revolution.

688
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,240
If you see something else coming through the pipes, the series of tubes, then you know

689
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,000
it might be a real revolution.

690
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,960
But first we've got a dismantle this thing known as mainstream, not that it has

691
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
to go away.

692
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,720
We just have to show you what it is so you can recognize it and remember inherently

693
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:20,960
television makes use of lighting and sets and zooms and cuts and fades and all kinds

694
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,560
of things that you will understand much better if you take the TV, the Zen TV experiment.

695
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,160
I'll just have to post the link once again to it.

696
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Let's check out the phone lines.

697
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,040
Of course, we have a number of phone numbers for you to call in one in the United States

698
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:55,280
to New Jersey and one in London in the UK.

699
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,320
Hey, I'm Mr. John and Omaha, a great story on a BBC thing.

700
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,640
I've always been suspect, a government run communication.

701
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,200
Again, we're putting the media into the hands of a few.

702
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,920
I much rather have it in the free market where I can decide what I see is to or fact on

703
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,920
what somebody else.

704
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,680
Tell me if that or at least try and show me that that might be to or fact or fall, so

705
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,680
I should say.

706
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
Anyway, keep up the great work.

707
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,280
I would say that I'm a red pill and what you're doing with Potcho is that total free

708
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,400
marketization of the communication out there and getting this out of or into more people's

709
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,680
hands and out of the government control.

710
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,160
Again, that's my problem that I have with the BBC and also the FCC in the United States.

711
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,160
Thanks, bye.

712
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,520
Well, yes indeed.

713
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,480
I'm glad you're slipping down the red pillage there.

714
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,360
BBC is a little bit different though.

715
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:58,200
It's yes, government and yes, the government makes up a lot of the rules and there's

716
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,960
a board of governors and they're all tied into the government.

717
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,200
But the idea is, is philosophically really good, you know, it was like, hey, everyone

718
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:15,040
he pony up some bucks, I think it is like 136 pounds 50, so about $300 a year.

719
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,520
It's not insignificant, pony up some money and we'll make some great programming for you.

720
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:27,920
The problem is, of course, that it's really the problem is ratings, you know, well,

721
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,680
that's twofold ratings and availability of bandwidth.

722
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,160
Look, the BBC has, you know, three main channels, really two main channels.

723
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
BBC won BBC two.

724
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
There you go.

725
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,480
That for television.

726
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,880
Those can be seen by the entire population because it's distributed very widely, still

727
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,960
distributed through the air for free.

728
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,760
Well, sorry, not for free because of course you have to pay up if you have a television.

729
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,640
But there's only so much you can shove down those channels.

730
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,240
Yeah, they got the BBC three and four and digital channels, but you know, those audiences

731
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,680
are much more limited in scope.

732
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,200
So there's only so much you can put on.

733
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,680
So what do you want to put on?

734
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,360
Well, you want to put on the stuff that people like the most.

735
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:11,280
The only way we have to determine that is through ratings and it's the same ratings

736
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,960
that the commercial guys look at and, you know, the theory remains the same.

737
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,280
You know, you sure you may have an niche program that is great for a very small amount

738
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,880
of people who love it and are really happy and feel that that's worth the fee that they're

739
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,680
paying.

740
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,160
But probably it's not going to see the light of day because they have to, you know, all

741
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,840
this stuff has to be pushed through this very narrow piece of bandwidth, no, you know,

742
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,280
just two linear channels 24 hours a day.

743
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,440
So they have to make choices.

744
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,080
So it's never going to be your niche programming that you like, which is exactly why companies

745
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,920
like pod show exists to bring you that niche programming.

746
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,080
Do you know how many aviation programs I subscribe to when I listen to, there's only half

747
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,880
a million pilots in the United States.

748
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:59,120
It's really not that much, you know, so of course, you're not going to get tons of aviation

749
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,920
shows through that very narrow pipe, which is that linear, linear playout basis.

750
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,240
No, of course not.

751
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:15,080
And once we are able to really change advertising, show advertisers what they can do and

752
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:20,640
how much more rich the environment is instead of your 20 to 30 second in your face spot,

753
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,560
I think we're really going to have a lot of fun.

754
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:29,520
It may be a bit of, you know, pandemonium, but, uh, happy thought.

755
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,120
Hey, I understand John and Omaha, great story on that BBC thing.

756
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,120
I've always been suspect.

757
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,920
I'm sorry.

758
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,960
I didn't mean to do that.

759
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,720
Here's what I meant to do this one.

760
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,400
Hey, Adam, this is special event of the financially.

761
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,920
I guess that marking of a conflict was an idea of C7, you know, a great idea of how

762
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,800
television is deceased.

763
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,640
It'd be really cool.

764
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,480
I mean, you could such a video podcast, you know, I don't know if a person's a flop, but

765
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
whatever.

766
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,840
But, uh, take some clips of either stuff that you've done or stuff that, you know, you

767
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,960
production's your own part of and all steps through, uh, with the audience, okay, here's

768
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,960
where he did this.

769
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,120
Okay, here's where the, uh, the satellite, think, uh, you know, kind of got fun.

770
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,560
Here's when we did this or here's how he did this.

771
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,920
And really show the man behind the curtain, show the map, how the magic tricks have

772
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
done.

773
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,840
I think it'd be instructive, you know, for someone who's been in media as long as you

774
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:30,040
have and on the broadcast media, so I just show all the tricks and, uh, and secrets

775
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,920
that are out there that broadcast media uses and expose them for what they are.

776
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,680
Uh, they've been really, really cool in a very second, a heck of a lot of fun too.

777
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,800
So hopefully we'll see that, uh, from the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the

778
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
hard show team.

779
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
The great, uh, I, I just got it.

780
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,440
Anyway, keep it for great work and, um, stand tuned to the DSC.

781
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Yeah, man.

782
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Absolutely.

783
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,240
And that's a great idea, Chris, and I, and I, and I will try to do that.

784
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,760
It's hard, though, to remember, I mean, this, it's been, my mainstream broadcast career

785
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,680
has been, uh, all deception, I guess, of, uh, of the public, you know, to, to, to varying

786
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,880
degrees, you know, not really, um, horrible.

787
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:15,000
I do remember distinctly though, I interviewed Madonna, um, in 1982 or 1983.

788
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,000
She was holed up at the, uh, uh, uh, what's the place that has the, the Skylight Bar, uh,

789
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,240
the La Mondrian when it was still, maybe it's still called La Mondrian on Sunset strip.

790
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,680
And this was when she, uh, the first time, no, it was the second time she was releasing

791
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,080
her album that had borderline on it, like a virgin.

792
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,320
She released that earlier in 81, um, and I'd met her very, very briefly at the Pirate

793
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,040
of Station at Amsterdam, that, but brief enough to do some hash under a glass.

794
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
She didn't, she didn't remember me.

795
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,040
That's for sure.

796
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,600
Um, and, uh, you know, we, uh, did the interview.

797
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,760
We conducted the interview on on the balcony overlooking Los Angeles.

798
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,400
And at one point, I can't remember, it's a long time ago.

799
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,080
I can't remember what I asked, but she didn't like the questions and said, this is stupid.

800
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,600
I'm not going to do this anymore.

801
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,800
And, you know, and she walked in, uh, back into the room.

802
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,680
She came out later to finish off, but it was like, uh, it was, she was so bitchy and so

803
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,680
mean.

804
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,680
And it was so weird that she did that.

805
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,240
Well, maybe that wasn't weird.

806
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,480
I can't remember what I asked, but something apparently offended.

807
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,600
But it's just through a little minor history fit, not a problem, right?

808
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,120
But when we put that interview on television, it was, of course, intercut with the pieces

809
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,400
of the video from like a virgin, and I think pieces of borderline.

810
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,200
And that entire piece was, you know, there were two edits.

811
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,880
Our director actually had made a fantastic edit where he really showed how pissy Madonna

812
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
looked.

813
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,880
I think for the time it was revolutionary, you know, and put that whole piece in and, and it

814
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,320
was, it was much more a representation of what had happened on the spot.

815
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,440
But management said, no, no, no, come on, man, she's a big star and people want to

816
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,440
love her.

817
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,280
And, you know, let's just make it into a happy piece.

818
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,560
And so, well, you know, it wasn't horrible.

819
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:58,560
I think it was wrong because it would have been so much more interesting to have seen,

820
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,240
you know, to have seen that side of her, particularly at that moment in her, uh, in her

821
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,440
career.

822
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
But it didn't happen.

823
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,160
I was, you know, it was changed, changed to fit whatever made sense for the ratings, I

824
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
guess.

825
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,600
In fact, literally, to make sense for whatever made sense for the ratings.

826
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:21,480
Hey, Adam, it's Jeff Sats, calling in from Florida, regarding your television deception

827
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,480
conversation.

828
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,360
Um, the kind of stuff you'd do with Janet Jackson is definitely standard operating procedure

829
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,880
for interviewing, especially when things are often done with a single camera.

830
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,360
Um, in the early 80s, pretty much my first job at a college, I produced a show called

831
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,720
Celebrity on cable television, Allison Spiel, the nightbird, was the host of this.

832
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,320
She was a terrific woman, a real character.

833
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,600
Got plenty of Allison Spiel stories for another time.

834
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,600
Um, excuse me.

835
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:53,120
Anyway, we would cover all the movie premieres and the press junk that's going on in New York

836
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:58,160
and we'd have access to all the stars to interview them about the movies and we'd go

837
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
to the premieres.

838
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,600
So we always went with a single camera and we set up the interviews with a single camera,

839
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
shoot.

840
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,680
So we would shoot the interview east.

841
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,360
We tried to get over the shoulders, shot or two of Allison talking to them from the

842
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,360
office chair.

843
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,280
And then at a later time, sometimes right then in the area to the celebrity left, but sometimes

844
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,480
back in our offices at a later date, we would shoot out and asking the questions and then

845
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,240
it would all be edited together in the finished product, we'd look like Allison was sitting

846
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,120
there talking to the celebrity, standard practice, probably still standard practice today.

847
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,160
One time Allison was sick, she couldn't show up and we were supposed to interview Robin

848
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,160
Williams.

849
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,560
So I show up to the junkets and I tell Robin Williams, I show the picture of Allison Spiel and

850
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,440
I say, she's going to be the hostess, but she's not here, so I'm going to interview you,

851
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,840
but when it airs, it's going to be awesome interviewing you.

852
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,560
No problem with Robin Williams, it's a terrific guy in person, great to interview.

853
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,560
We went through the interview.

854
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,600
I asked all the questions, I was very careful not to let my voice overlap with his, so the

855
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,560
editors wouldn't have any problem.

856
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,040
We went our very way, at a later date, we shot Allison asking the questions, put it

857
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,280
all together and when the show aired, it looked like Allison Spiel was sitting in the

858
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,280
area in the room with Robin Williams, doing the interview, of course she wasn't there.

859
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,280
Standard practice happens all the time.

860
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
Thanks again.

861
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,800
Yo, man, thank you for sharing.

862
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Oh, absolutely.

863
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,560
I definitely still happens all the time.

864
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,640
In fact, that's one of the parts I love about John Stewart's daily show, the most,

865
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,520
is where they, I'm sure you've seen the interviews, where they're interviewing someone

866
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,960
about some serious topic and then there's all kinds of bogus asked questions and then

867
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,960
stupid answers.

868
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,840
And if you look really closely, so for instance, Samantha B will be on camera over the

869
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,400
shoulder of the person who's being interviewed.

870
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,320
You'll see that that person's mouth is moving, you'll see their jaw moving or the side

871
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,480
of their, the side of their cheek and you'll see that it isn't in sync with what they're

872
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,480
actually saying.

873
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,880
Those things are completely cut together because you're right.

874
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,200
They go off with one camera, do the interview and then do what we call cutaways and

875
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,080
noties and the noties are really important.

876
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,440
When you have an interview with someone, the first thing that always happens, it's cut

877
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,440
down to length.

878
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,680
You know, it's like we got, that's how the sound bite came to and came into existence.

879
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:11,000
You know, hey, look, we've got one minute, so we're going to put this in, put this in,

880
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,880
we're going to do a cutaway here and now the cutaway, when they do an edit, that's what

881
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,040
they need that, that you'll watch it now, you'll see it on the news all the time, you'll

882
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,440
see the interviewer doing one of these, yeah, so, you know, very interested, like head

883
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:29,240
shaking up and down, yeah, yeah, and it's a talent, the worst thing, by the way, is to

884
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:35,400
interview someone and then after they're, you have to interview, you're saying, okay,

885
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,760
we need some cutaways, that means they have to sit there, the camera moves to over their

886
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,640
shoulder and you ask the exact same fucking questions again.

887
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,520
So it's like, it's not, it's completely removed from a natural dialogue and in your case,

888
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,640
wow, you showed a picture, this is what the first thing will look like in the finished product.

889
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,280
You created a little, little mini feature right there.

890
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,280
So is it deception?

891
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,880
Yeah, you know, it's, it's just good to understand how it works because it's exactly what

892
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,880
goes on.

893
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,320
And again, I really have stories where all the good shit was lost because of the stupid

894
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:13,720
system, the way this is supposed to work, I interviewed Paul McCartney at MPL, McCartney

895
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,560
publishing limited, in the same time around, you know, it wasn't, maybe even before I

896
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:21,960
interviewed Madonna in those very early 80 days when I still working in the Netherlands.

897
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:27,920
And so MPL and London, and I spilled tea all over his MPL rug, you know, the big McCartney

898
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,920
logo.

899
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,040
And, you know, and so there we are in our hands and knees trying to, you know, mop up this

900
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,800
tea, ding elevator opens, Linda walks in, she's on her hands and knees, completely

901
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,040
beautiful, beautiful television.

902
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:45,160
We had those stupid, vis-news guys that was like, you know, because of the unions, you

903
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,000
couldn't bring your own camera guy, you had to use someone, it was employed locally.

904
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,720
And so these like, these half dead guys for vis-news and, you know, you could rent them.

905
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,960
And a guy had turned a camera off.

906
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,160
He wasn't even, he was like, just sitting there looking like, oh, well, it spilled

907
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,160
tea.

908
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,800
Oh, that good stuff, all that good stuff, all lost.

909
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:11,560
Hi, Adam, this is Raymond from the Netherlands and I was watching some live TV a couple

910
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:16,760
of years ago, from the NOS, which is of course our Dutch public service, and it was

911
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,440
the interview with the Newt Lover, so then the Prime Minister or the Minister of

912
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:29,880
President, and, well, anyways, at the 8 o'clock news at that night, they changed the

913
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:35,080
live interview, they changed the order of the questions, and by doing that, they also

914
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:41,600
gave the impression that is a viewpoint on the matter and was, I don't remember exactly

915
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,760
what it was about, but it was really surprising that, by just changing a couple of questions,

916
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,840
you know, the order that they could change something like that, and it was very disappointing

917
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:54,000
because at that time I was thinking, well, the NOS, you know, national public television,

918
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,720
that's supposed to be truthful and all that kind of stuff, but there you go, it's just

919
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,720
vacant, for sure, all of them.

920
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,720
Bye.

921
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,160
Yeah, all part of the blue pill world that we live in, my friend, and it doesn't just happen

922
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,160
in television.

923
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:16,680
Yeah, I'm a totally different, I'm calling in about the DOE, what is it, the 637, and you

924
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:24,880
were asking about media, asked to call in about media, and if you were to show anything

925
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,440
where we were part of a deception, well, I can't say you did that, I was on a media show,

926
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:35,960
but I was at a sporting event, and at the time, I was a sports blogger, I wrote

927
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:42,600
stories on a local sports team here in Minnesota, and I knew the ownership were well,

928
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:49,280
and they had a contest going on, and they couldn't get anybody to participate in the

929
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:57,200
contest, I guess, I don't see why they couldn't get anybody, but they asked me, if I

930
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:05,920
would grab my kid, and participated in it, and we did, and we had fun doing it, but

931
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:12,920
I don't know if it was the other participant in it, was also from the media, from a local

932
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:13,920
newspaper.

933
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:20,600
So, we've heard in the beginning about it, but just got the media involved, and of course,

934
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:26,280
I wrote about it in my blog at the time, so sports teams do the same thing, and the

935
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,120
new people are a lot of friends are seeing, and they're the more excited, and I'm hoping

936
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:36,680
that they're going to be part of it, not the center, but the sports teams are doing

937
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,680
it as well.

938
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,680
Sure.

939
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,280
I've got to let you know that one thing, so I'd have a good day.

940
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,280
Yeah, man.

941
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,280
It's all a part of entertainment.

942
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,280
Oh, contest.

943
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,280
It's the worst.

944
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,280
Any type of contest.

945
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,280
You know why?

946
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,040
Because they want to have people who look good on camera, or excuse me, sound good on the

947
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,040
air.

948
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,040
Oh, man.

949
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,680
There's not a single phone call that I haven't played back on traditional radio, where

950
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,760
I wouldn't have cut out at least five or six different bits.

951
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:07,000
You know, digital recording and editing in on-air studios becomes such a big deal.

952
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,560
Because, you know, you get a contest winner.

953
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:12,320
Oh, man, I've heard this shocky's go, you know, you just won $100, and it didn't take

954
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,440
it to see the Rolling Stones, and the person would go, oh, cool.

955
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,840
And then the disc shocker say, oh, hold on, man.

956
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,840
I'm recording this.

957
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,560
I want you to sound really excited, and I'll ask the question again, you'll just say,

958
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,160
you just won $100, and then take it to the Rolling Stones, and of course, the person

959
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,800
goes, woo, woo, woo.

960
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,800
It's all fake.

961
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,680
They weren't excited, and for the length of fuck, I already had, you know, Rolling Stones

962
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,840
who cares, don't know, no matter anymore.

963
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,320
Of course, of all the feedback I've received, not everybody agrees.

964
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,920
I had a minute to roll it from the Don't Compass podcast.

965
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:50,160
Just listening to your daily source code, six, three, seven, yes, today's one about the BBC,

966
00:52:50,160 --> 00:53:01,080
and the way that TV has accepted the masses, and to be honest, I mean, I've worked for

967
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:09,280
the BBC for crying out loud, and so it's not as bad as you'd quite think.

968
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:15,880
I mean, this kind of thing isn't going to bring down the British Broadcasting Corporation,

969
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,120
I can tell you that for a kick-off.

970
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:27,040
The Director General is, as so rightly, cancelled all these things for a huge review, and, you

971
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:33,720
know, things will get put into place, the deception is no longer there, you know, it's

972
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:40,760
a really important thing that, to be able to see a doing, not just in trying to sort

973
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:46,920
this problem out, but of the content that they give, and they're reviewing over a million

974
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,920
hours of footage to see if there's any other incidents like this.

975
00:53:51,920 --> 00:54:02,240
There's going to be the people in question of all being suspended or dismissed, and, yeah,

976
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:13,360
it's going to be interesting times, but the BBC do absolutely fantastic job, and you'll

977
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:20,360
comment about Britain, the company down, the corporation down, I feel, is a long one,

978
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:26,600
it's not, it's the trust will come back, the trust of the public will come back to the

979
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,600
BBC, I am convinced of that.

980
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:34,800
Oh, Adam, I just thought I'd throw my tuppins into the pond, take it easy, by now.

981
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,440
Oh, dude, your tuppins is more than appreciated, please, open wide, I'm going to shove a

982
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,440
red pill down your throat because you really need one.

983
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,080
Maybe I should explain what I mean by their coming down, they're going down.

984
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:57,880
Let's just understand that the nature of media has become, but I think always has been

985
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:06,720
about audience size, getting more people to tune in, stop by, pick it up, read it, surf

986
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:13,160
to download, it's about more and more people, it's always been about that.

987
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:18,200
The problem is, before we could actually, before we actually understood the beast, and of

988
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,240
course we understand how television works were getting pretty good out of ourselves, just

989
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:28,320
go to YouTube or look at any of the pod show video shows, you know, we understand how to

990
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,360
make this media, it's not all that hard, you know, it's now we have all those tools,

991
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,640
it's about the distribution, and this distribution, of course, has been extremely interesting

992
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,040
to people of power, people, and that's not just politicians, it's also people have something

993
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:51,320
to sell, you know, big consumer goods companies, and they've been able to, the whole,

994
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:56,600
the whole architecture is based upon, again, you know, the most people, it's the sureest

995
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,360
way to get your message out, the more people you are able to reach.

996
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,800
There's no real targeting going on yet, yeah, there's some, you know, of course there's

997
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,520
niche channels, and, you know, what's happening now with independent media is there's tons

998
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:16,040
of niche stuff around, it's my, I see my job is to enable that to continue by being able

999
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:21,600
to monetize on it, you can't do shit for free forever, just doesn't work that way,

1000
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:28,000
however, there's no real malice, I do not believe in a grand master plan, there's no

1001
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,520
master plan that says let's deceive the public, you know, people who get up in the morning

1002
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,080
and go to work for television aren't thinking about that, but they are thinking one thing,

1003
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:41,560
we've got to entertain, we've got to get the ratings, we've got to get as many people

1004
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:47,520
watching or listening or reading or downloading or surfing to or page viewing, that's

1005
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:53,120
just the nature of it, because that's how you make a sustainable business, of course

1006
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,280
there's a lot of people who don't have to do this at all, and you can continue doing

1007
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:02,320
independent stuff, but if you want to grow, you need money, it's just a fact, I can't help

1008
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:15,120
it, I can't get around it, so the flow of media, the way it from where I see it is,

1009
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:20,000
and I think probably associated press is one of the biggest problems, you have these

1010
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:28,800
huge indicators of so-called news, and what distinguishes news and how it's reported and

1011
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:34,400
how factual it is doesn't matter after it's first introduced, because and you can follow

1012
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:41,680
this, every other single media property will quote that so-called reliable source, and then

1013
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,400
other people will quote that source that's quoting the reliable source, it's the copy-paced

1014
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,800
culture, because this problem is not just in television, it's not just in radio, it's in print,

1015
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,280
it's in newspapers, we need viewers, we need people to be interested, so what are the stories,

1016
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,520
people are interested in, well they're interested in crap, they're interested in Britney Spears,

1017
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:08,480
yes we're also interested in Iraq and Afghanistan and North Korea, but if you're going to

1018
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,840
present it in a boring way, we're just not going to watch it because we want to be spoon fed

1019
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,600
like all the other stuff, why all of a sudden do I have to work extra hard to understand

1020
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,920
what's going on on the news, no, that's what people wake up in the morning to do and they don't

1021
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,240
really even realize it, they're all blue pillars, it's okay and they're just doing what they love

1022
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:29,600
doing, they like creating media and having lots of people pay attention to it, that's that's the only

1023
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:37,680
job, so you can't really fault anyone, however what I predict is going to happen, I think you're right

1024
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,800
is yes the trust will come back and yes the BBC will implement all kinds of editorial controls

1025
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:50,720
and all kinds of gates to make sure that you know the stuff that gets on the air or on the

1026
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:56,320
website or on television or whatever that it's accurate and that it's correct and guess what,

1027
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:03,680
it's going to be boring, it's going to be incredibly fucking boring, that's our chance

1028
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:12,400
because I do believe because we don't have this limitation of time that we can make things

1029
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:20,560
interesting to a large audience and that audience can be a long tale of many many niche audiences

1030
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,360
and we can do it in an entertaining way, look, you know, I didn't have to stop after 30 minutes of

1031
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,600
this podcast because I didn't have to, you didn't have to listen to it either, you could just

1032
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:34,640
fast forward to the bits you wanted to or skip over pieces, there's your core difference, that's

1033
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:41,200
where we win because people will migrate, they'll migrate to the things they want to hear,

1034
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,560
the things that are interesting to them and it could be very, very niche but we're going to win

1035
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:52,960
when the BBC and other mainstream media have so many regulations and so much porn on top of them

1036
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:59,360
that they'll just be boring because that will also bring upon a huge financial problem because

1037
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:05,600
all of these phone lines, all of these scams that were in place and make no mistake, they're scams,

1038
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,400
oh yeah, I think I'm going to get a text back from that really cute chick, I don't get one

1039
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,720
text back from a cute chick, I get three a week, I'm automatically subscribed, these are scams,

1040
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:20,560
complete scams, just a rob people of money, you know, of course people are gullible but they're

1041
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:24,080
waking up to that now, that's the whole other side of this and this is going to happen in the

1042
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:30,560
United States as well and you're going to see that television, particularly television, has been

1043
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:39,280
subsidizing their mere existence through these phone scams and they'll have to go back to very

1044
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:45,680
boring, very simple programming. Hi Adam, this is Alex from podcastjunkie.co.uk,

1045
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:52,800
loved your DSC 637, I've come up with a letter to the BBC that I've posted at my blog and it

1046
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:58,720
goes something like this, do a BBC, has I've been paying you in good faith for honest television

1047
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:05,040
programming to principally sum of £135.50 a year and there's obviously you've been cheating

1048
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:10,480
lying to me and to millions of people, what do you say I'll skip paying you for the next year?

1049
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:16,000
After all you haven't been providing me with the service I would expect, have you? You've lied

1050
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,280
and you've cheated, you've been given a year to clean up your act, however as you've been lying

1051
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,800
and cheating for years, I really don't think that me with holding only one year's license fee could

1052
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:32,560
be considered illegal, do you? Thanks for the great show's Adam and regards to you and all your

1053
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:41,520
listeners, massive red pill. Yeah, there's one thing I hadn't even thought about in the

1054
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:47,120
midst of all of this, but John points it out very well. Hi Adam, he's John, long time listener,

1055
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:54,880
the BBC, a public service broadcaster, paid for by the license fee, by license fee,

1056
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,400
he read out seven instances where they confess now to break in the rules again.

1057
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:09,600
They were recently signed £50,000, so the bleep teacher isn't aware they did the same thing,

1058
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:15,760
presumably there's another seven now, are they going to be signed at £50,000?

1059
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:25,760
In the room, $60,000, it's mine, they're like the rules, they get signed, they pay with my money!

1060
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:34,160
Want to load a shit? Thanks Adam. Dude, you're so spot on, I hadn't even thought about that,

1061
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:40,560
the 50,000, it's your money, it's my money, where's it going to? It's going to the government,

1062
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:46,160
that is, you're so right, man, that is so incredibly wrong, the penalties have to be completely

1063
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:52,960
overhauled, good point and a good, good, good point in the show to wrap it up with one last song,

1064
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,200
which is from the pod save music network authorized by Alice Cooper himself.

1065
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:25,280
She spends her life through, pleasing up her man, she feeds him dinner or anything she can,

1066
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:32,160
she cries alone and night too often,

1067
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:48,000
he smokes and drinks and don't come home at all, only we're being bleep, only we're being bleep,

1068
01:03:48,000 --> 01:04:02,960
only we're being bleep, only we're being bleep, man makes your head gray,

1069
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:14,560
he's your life's mistake, when all you're really looking for is a need for break,

1070
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:30,640
he lies right at you, you know you hate this game, he slaps you once and a while and you live and love,

1071
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:45,360
she cries alone and night too often, he smokes and drinks and don't come home at all,

1072
01:04:45,360 --> 01:05:06,000
only we're being bleep, only we're being bleep, only we're being bleep, only we're being bleep,

1073
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:27,360
only we're being bleep, only we're being bleep,

1074
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:48,560
like eyes full of the time, don't spend the time, clean up this trash and you there,

1075
01:05:48,640 --> 01:06:00,480
down on your knees, again, please come watch, bleep, bleep,

1076
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:13,120
watch, bleep, bleep,

1077
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:38,160
only we're being bleep, only we're being bleep, only we're being bleep, only we're being bleep,

1078
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:51,840
only we're being bleep, only we you're being bleep, only we're being bleep, only we're being bleep,

1079
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:57,840
Only when I'm bleeding

1080
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,840
I'm alone

1081
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:06,840
And it's me to all the women in America

1082
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,840
All the women in Afghanistan

1083
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:14,840
All the women in Africa

1084
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,840
To the women of the world

1085
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,840
Don't let your memory ring your damn

1086
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:27,840
Just keep that dick ass out of town

1087
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,840
Stand up for yourself

1088
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,840
Stand up for yourself

1089
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,840
And don't let your man hurt you

1090
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,840
Just call your sister

1091
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,840
And your sister's with me there

1092
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,840
Only when I'm bleeding

1093
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,840
Only when I'm bleeding

1094
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,840
Only when I'm bleeding

1095
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,840
Only when I'm bleeding

1096
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,840
Only when I'm bleeding

1097
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,840
Only when I'm bleeding

1098
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,840
It's got to be one of my favorite Alice Cooper tracks of all time

1099
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,840
All time

1100
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,840
All to you pot safe

By Wednesday

1102
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:18,840
Only when I'm bleeding

1103
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,840
Fully sanctioned by Alice Cooper

1104
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,840
To put it on the pot safe music network

1105
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,840
So another cool for the networking

1106
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:25,840
What an awesome song

1107
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,840
Definitely

1108
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,840
Another piece of the puzzle

1109
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,840
