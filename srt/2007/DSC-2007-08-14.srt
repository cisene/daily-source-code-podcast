1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey home fries, it's CC Chapman from accident hash, encouraging you to check out

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
BODON.TV slash battle.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's one of the coolest battle events out there, and you can only find it at BODON.TV.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You're where to miss Thony, from joysie.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey, first of all, congrats on your anniversary.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Seems like this yesterdays you was getting yourselves all together.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah, now you're making a big time.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, I heard you and the families go into New York going to their fire island for the

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Big Family reunion.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You know, if you get some time swing by the old neighborhood, we can have some fun, and

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You know, we got a tire island.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You know, it's a big stack of tires in my backyard.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We can pretend we're doing whatever.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You know what I'm saying.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Come on down.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We're doing a little cookout, walk around in a wife beaters have a good time.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's a summer.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You got to relax.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You got to take it easy.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So don't forget us guys down here in the neighborhood.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
No, I'm saying.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
All right.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Peace out.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And have fun on the DSC 651.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
For $60 million worth of airplane strap to my ass.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We don't need no sticky prints.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I like to think I'm flying into this short.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Fantastic.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's a bedroom curry.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pull me out of time.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And hold me on the line.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pull me out of time.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pull me out of time.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Help me, baby, what you have been on the stand

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're helping me see my soul

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're helping me see my soul

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're making me Peace

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're helping me see my soul

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're helping meOST

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Maybe I'm a fan, I'm maybe I'm a lonely man

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And I'm maybe like something that he doesn't really understand

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Maybe I'm a man, maybe I'm the only one that I could have with me

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Maybe I won't you help me, I'm sad

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Maybe I'm a man, maybe I'm a man

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, maybe I'm a man

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Let me just make myself up on the floor for a minute

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
May it's back

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Blake Morgan, ribs are all a new one

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Maybe I'm amazed, it's from Blake's album Burning Daylight

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And it is pod safe, my friends, that's right

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's on the pod safe music network as of today

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Blake with his engine company records has license this

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
In the proper manner so that he can actually make it pod safe

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And there you have it played for your enjoyment on the daily source code

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's for the Burning Daylight album

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Which I think comes out today, actually

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Awesome

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh man, link in in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It is episode number 651 coming to you from the west side of G-town

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Where the water flows downhill, thank goodness

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Because it's still a wet one

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
In fact, the rain is literally flying horizontally past the attic window

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh man, it's nasty out today, really, really, really bad

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And then you've got these people protesting at Heathrow Airport

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
They're expecting, I think several thousand people

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They're already there, they've got tents and they're going to disrupt Heathrow Airport

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I think half of the people are from the surrounding area of the new terminal five

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Which they're really pissed off

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I think there's like 4,000 homes, which will probably be rendered pretty useless

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
When they open up the third runway at Heathrow

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So they're protesting, of course

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You might know when to go live in near an airport

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I hate to say it, but that's just the truth

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And other people are there against aviation in general

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Not general aviation, but aviation in general

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Because of it's effects on the global climate change

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And I look out the window today and I say, screw you with your global tour climate change

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Where's the warming part of all of this?

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know if I'm going to listen to it here, I'm going to repeat that

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You got from a car last week, he was giving you a hard time about how much wine

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And you do about whether, you know, I'm an amateur astronomer

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And I can completely informally relate to it

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You know, this time of year, I was going to send from North Carolina

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And this time of year, you know, it's got awful heat and humidity and buginess

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You know, at night all that moisture just hangs in the air

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You know, I'm out in the country and you have a good view of the stars

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
All I get is just this big murky summer haze

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And this time of year, I just hate it

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You know, like I said, you know, people, people

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Completed about listening to you complaining about the weather

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
People complained about me complaining about the weather

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Which I'm in turn, I'm sure is complaining about something else

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I could just totally relate

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So why do I wait my friend?

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll send you some cheese to go with it

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
All right, why didn't she?

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why didn't she?

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why didn't she?

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Wrap it up.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Thank you very much.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We've got the wine and cheese.

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, I'm wanting about the weather

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Luckily, though, we're leaving tomorrow

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Towards the muggy humidity of New York, of course,

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We'll be out on Fire Island

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
In the wife beaters running around

119
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's going to be nice with my sister Willow and her two kids

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That'll be nice.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's going to be fun, man.

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm looking forward to that

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Although I must say there is so much stuff happening here

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
With BT Pod Show in the UK that I really, from a work standpoint

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I really don't want to go

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So now, you know, there's some meetings I tried to get hooked up

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
For today, it's just neat soon.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
People got scheduled schedules and agendas

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So I'm going to set those up for the week of the 27th

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
When I come back, which will be a short week

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Because then I'm going to go to

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The West Coast

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
September 1st, I believe, is that the Saturday, let me check

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I think it is Saturday, Saturday, September 1st

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm planning on being in Los Angeles

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
For the big, cost-as-world party

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I forget what the party is for

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Let me say, let me just go into the Gmail here for a second

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let me see what does

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hmm

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Now, of course, I can't find it

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Crap

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Well, September 1st is some kind of party for cost-as-world

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Tony Price, who not only is one of our prized media properties

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
One of the great shows that we have on the Pod Show network

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He also does sales in Los Angeles

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And Tony is a great guy

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And what I'd really like to encourage you is to, in fact, I'll put a link in the show notes

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You've got to listen to cost-as-world

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Truly

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Tony is, I'd have to say, really a leading voice in young black America

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Now the show, in a way you could say, it's almost like an African-American, you know, Howard Stern

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But really, it's not, you know, because what Tony does is he tackles all of these topics

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
See they did the apparent fear

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That black man have of homosexuality

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That was called No Homo, the name of that show

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The most recent one was about Mexican immigrants in California

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I mean, really, really hard-hitting issues

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And he's got a whole room full of people

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And they all step up to the mic

161
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And Tony is definitely a voice of reason

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Through all of that

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But just I love listening to that show

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And I cannot wait to throw down

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And party is the white shadow of cost-as-world

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Hey, Ed and it's Mark from Hamburg

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There's before you disappear into the new world

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Give us an update

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What's going on with Cochill and John Vark

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
When this is new show starting

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You know, already unsubscribe from the cranky geeks

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And I'm afraid I won't get my dose of stroke

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So please

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I have a couple things there

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
First of all, John Show tech five is actually it just quadrupled in numbers

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Earlier last week

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Probably because he started to promote it on devourac.org slash blog

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Techfive.podshow.com

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Tango Echo Charlie Hotel

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And then five, the number five.podshow.com

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You can find John's tech five report

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I like it, he's really gotten into his own now

183
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And it's essentially the quick news items of the day

184
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He's taken on it and in and out

185
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Which is brew, call, drink, bubbling in the background

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But like it very much

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I wouldn't unsubscribe from cranky geeks though

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Because he's going to continue to do that show

189
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Which I think is a fantastic program

190
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I really enjoy watching it

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
In fact, I'm going to try and be on it when I'm on San Francisco

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
First week of September

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's, you know, don't, don't unsubscribe

194
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Or from Twitter for that matter

195
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You know, that's all definitely part of John's empire

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But there will be more that he'll be doing for podshow

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And he's also, John is also a guy behind the scenes

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He does a lot of, you know, a lot of the strategy and thinking

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And marketing

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And complaining

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Which is good

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Doug Pilgrim, our friend from Boston, Massachusetts

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Sent in an awesome YouTube clip

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is so incredibly funny

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It won't really translate

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Let me see, I'm going to open it up, regardless

207
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It won't really translate into audio, I don't think

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Now this is more about mainstream media

209
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Fulling you

210
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And, you know, fulling, lying, trickery

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Or entertaining, maybe it's all the same sides of the same coin

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This is from the program Man vs Wild

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Which has been a part of this controversy all along

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And, well, let me see

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So essentially, what you see here is you see a bear

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Walking along this, this crevice

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Or is it crevice

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This crevice

219
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And there's like a lava bridge, you know, not real bridge

220
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But it's just lava rocks and he's like, you know, like the scary music

221
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And he's jumping over those rocks

222
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And then the guy who put this video up on YouTube

223
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Does the same thing, except he reveals a little bit more

224
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Let me see if I can give you the sound

225
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, listen to that

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That is a way to do it

227
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So you see the footage, what's that?

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
These lava bridges across and over

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Sort of the same way, you get snow bridges over crevice

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Travasses

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So you've got to be really, really careful crossing these

232
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So he's just because you don't know what's solid

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And what's hollow underneath

234
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So he does this like daring jump

235
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And now he crosses the crevice

236
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Wow, music up, big drum beats

237
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So the guy who posted this YouTube clip

238
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He's standing in the exact same spot

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He's got like, you know, like, dorky shorts on

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And a washed out pink tea shirt

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And some kind of, like, almost looks like an Australian

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Like, out back hat

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And he, so he does the same jump

244
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Walks the other side, really casually

245
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Except now the camera continues to pan left

246
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And you see that the crevice ends, you know, about

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
20 feet down the road

248
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
In fact, then the camera zooms in

249
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There's a whole fucking road there with cars driving

250
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But

251
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, it's funny

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You've got to see that

253
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Make sure you go to curry.com

254
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Or daily source code.com

255
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And look at the show and I was duck

256
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Thanks so much, buddy, for helping us to digest

257
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
More red pill information

258
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Drumming bass and bass

259
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So, let's just mention

260
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Featuring the best of all genres of electronic music

261
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000

264
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000

265

We'll talk with Robert in here

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Select tracks from his life performances

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
At four Mason and the Morrison Planetarium in San Francisco

269
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I find that when I'm documenting live concerts

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
There's a different energy to them

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And see live albums that I release

272
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
tend to be just the improvised concerts

273
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Which I reserve for our surface special occasions

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's less common for me to release something

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That is one of the concerts where I play pieces

276
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
From other albums

277
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
In part because I don't want to repeat pieces

278
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That want every album to be unique

279
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Come listen to the best of all genres of electronic music

280
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000

You've probably heard this song

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's gotten like 5 million views on YouTube

347
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
In fact I think it's the video that really propelled this thing into

348
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Some form of a meme across the tubes

349
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And he just looks kind of funky and dorky in the whole package is nice

353
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I like it. I like the song too

354
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Very, very, very deep lyrics

355
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Awesome

356
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Tazonde

357
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Links to that in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

358
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Let me see

359
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Oh yeah, I knew that after doing my shout out yesterday

360
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That someone would respond pretty quickly

361
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And it was Fred Zelda's

362
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
From the Netherlands

363
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You said, Adam, of course

364
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I have the very first daily source code

365
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Three years and a day ago to this date

366
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
No number at the time

367
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So it wasn't really DSC001

368
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But it's titled DSC204

369
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
2040813.mp3

370
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And in this show

371
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This first one which I recorded in the car in the studio A8

372
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
On my way to the Netherlands to break the

373
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
To pick up

374
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I think glasses or something

375
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Reading glasses, whatever

376
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
We're seeing eyeglasses

377
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I explain the format and the thought behind the daily source code

378
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I thought we'd take about four minutes

379
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And just listen to that opening sequence

380
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
From three years and a day ago

381
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Where you can hear exactly what this show is supposed to be about

382
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And I have to say

383
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I think I'm pretty much kept to it

384
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, good morning everybody

385
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And welcome to the daily source code

386
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Thank you very much for taking the time to download this MP3 file

387
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Or if some of you may have received it automatically overnight

388
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
As an enclosure in your aggregator

389
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
In that case, thanks for subscribing

390
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So first, what I'd like to do is explain exactly what this is

391
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What the daily source code is going to be

392
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And well, as the name already suggests

393
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's something that's going to be daily

394
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And I'd like to elaborate a little bit on

395
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The name

396
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Daily source code and what inspired me to do this

397
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Where that came from

398
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
By the way, I'm recording this in my car

399
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm on the way

400
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
From our home in Belgium

401
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
To Brida in the Netherlands

402
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
To pick up

403
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Your pair of glasses and contact loops

404
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What do we have here?

405
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Horse and carriage

406
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I think I'm going to have to take another route

407
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Anyway, the daily source code

408
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Let me back up here for a second

409
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm going to very narrow country lane

410
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And there's a horse and a drawn carriage coming my way

411
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So, you know what?

412
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm going to just step over here

413
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And while I'm talking to you guys

414
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll just wait for this guy to pass

415
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
When I was on vacation

416
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Just recently in Sorrento Italy

417
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
A couple of great things happened

418
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
First of all, as if by magic

419
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
My wireless microphone, which I had lost

420
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
For a few months

421
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I had the receiver part

422
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But just couldn't find the microphone part

423
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It was left over from our

424
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Reality show that we taped over a year ago

425
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And bought a couple of really professional

426
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Wireless mic kits

427
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
About $2,000 each

428
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So, this is great as great range

429
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And has a great sound

430
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's just fantastic

431
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's professional stuff

432
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And so I found that in a suitcase

433
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I've been lurking there apparently for a couple of months

434
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And I thought, well, all right

435
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Now I can finally start doing some audio

436
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Blogging again

437
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But also, I've loaded up my iPod

438
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You may or may not know that I have

439
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I've created a couple of scripts

440
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That parse some RSS feeds

441
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
With enclosures and automatically downloads

442
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The MP3 files and adds them to my iTunes library

443
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And to my iPod

444
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm subscribed to the IT Conversations feed

445
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And so I'd loaded that up

446
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Just to wait for this guy here

447
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Sure, buddy

448
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm happy to do it

449
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'd loaded it up

450
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And on there was a couple of conferences

451
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
A couple of sessions from the open source

452
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Developers Conference I believe

453
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And I forgot what the speaker was

454
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'll be sure to find out and link to him

455
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Was talking about what source code really is

456
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Is source code

457
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
The actual script that runs

458
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
That makes your computer do something

459
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Or the machine code that sits underneath all that

460
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Or is the source code perhaps

461
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Actually the written explanation

462
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Not just the funky English

463
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
That a computer can interpret

464
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That explains what a program is supposed to do

465
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And I kind of subscribe to that idea

466
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That maybe even an RFC

467
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Or just a functional description of

468
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay, here's what I want this computer program to do

469
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Here's how it should behave

470
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That that is the actual source code

471
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's the thought behind what eventually gets written

472
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
In computer code or in a scripting language

473
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So if you think about a radio program or an audio program like this

474
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You could kind of coincidentally

475
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's also called a program right

476
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I guess you could say that this is the source code to me

477
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's Adam source code

478
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And every single day a bit of me is filtered

479
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Through to the web

480
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And I write about what I'm thinking

481
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
What I've been reading

482
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
The links that I choose

483
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
The sites I choose to link to

484
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
All that comes from a certain mindset

485
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
On any given day or moment

486
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That's what I call the source code

487
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
So I figured if I

488
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
If I have a weblog and I've got all these links and stories

489
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It might be of some interest to some people

490
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
To listen to the source code of where all the ideas come from

491
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Well little did we know what would happen

492
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So although I don't blog that much anymore

493
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Of course the show goes up on the weblog every day

494
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And I do post stuff intermittently

495
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It is still pretty much two to four

496
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Let me just see there was a little bit left here

497
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I heard that's running around in my head

498
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That I can't possibly write down

499
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
There you go

500
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That's it

501
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's stuff running around my head

502
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
That I can't possibly write down

503
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That's exactly what this is

504
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's my life

505
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's my thoughts

506
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's my opinions

507
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I think we pretty much held to that

508
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Sounds a lot like an audio blog

509
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Honestly

510
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But notice that there's no music at the beginning

511
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And now it's much more packaged

512
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh boy

513
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It really has evolved

514
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's funny because I found

515
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Actually no I didn't find Fred sent me another link

516
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Two

517
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Daily source code

518
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
20040822

519
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So this is a little over a week later

520
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And this was obviously when I was still

521
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Tinkering around with the iPodder script

522
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So what I would do is I would create a little test file

523
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'd upload it

524
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And then I'd see if my aggregator would actually

525
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Grab it and download it

526
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Here's an example of one of those tests

527
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Okay

528
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
If all goes according to plan

529
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Then this was uploaded to my server

530
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Automatically by me dropping it

531
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Into a special folder on my desktop

532
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And a blog post was made

533
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And enclosures were added

534
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And everything went automatically

535
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Let's see if it worked

536
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And indeed it did work

537
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's cool Fred

538
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Thank you so much man

539
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I really appreciate that

540
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That's awesome

541
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You got me that first episode

542
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's oh by the way

543
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
As a special treat

544
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
If you are subscribed to the Daily source code

545
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Channel, the DSC channel

546
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Then you will get this episode

547
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
In its entirety

548
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Automatically as you just heard

549
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
We're still using the word

550
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
If you don't have the channel yet

551
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Go to Atom.podshow.com

552
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You'll see my channels right there

553
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Click on the DSC channel

554
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And then either put on your iPod

555
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Use one of those options

556
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
There you can put it on your iPod

557
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You can get the raw XML

558
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Do whatever you want

559
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
We can just play it right there

560
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Play the channel

561
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I've made it the first one

562
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
In the channel

563
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So it'll start playing immediately

564
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Now let me take you back

565
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
To the month of May

566
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
When I received the following

567
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Audio Comment

568
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Hey Adam

569
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's Sam here from London

570
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
In the UK

571
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I usually only phone you

572
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
To my non-spone

573
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
To place like them

574
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
To receive right here

575
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But today

576
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I won't be advised to do any of your servants

577
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm offended by him

578
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Finally last week

579
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Early on Thursday morning

580
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
To recount a bit of a horrifying story

581
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
She was welcome at 23 am

582
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
When you're extremely ill bang

583
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And the bedroom was full of the concrete smoke

584
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So the first thing she wanted to do was call the fire brigade

585
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So she wanted to pick up her phone

586
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But her phone was in two bits

587
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And the battery was missing

588
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
So she panicked

589
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
She thought someone was in a house

590
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So ran for the nearest phone box

591
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Fortunately when she got there

592
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
There were a piece about on the street

593
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
A night social grant

594
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
One of the police officers

595
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And said that there might be someone in my house

596
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The house might be on fire

597
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And stuff that would really need to help

598
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
The police went back to the house

599
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Fortunately the fire hadn't got any worse

600
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And the smoke could cleared

601
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And you confirmed that there was nobody in our house

602
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But on investigation

603
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
They found the mobile phone battery

604
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Now this Nokia mobile phone battery

605
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Had shot

606
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
From her mobile phone

607
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Across the side of the room

608
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And underneath the wardrobe

609
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And said itself on fire

610
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
There was a pretty much just a molten lump

611
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And the metal underneath the wardrobe

612
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And it sets fire to the carpet

613
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And also it's stuff that suits

614
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Now

615
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That was the story in May

616
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Today

617
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And this has been the most emailed article

618
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I've received in weeks

619
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Nokia announces product advisory

620
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
For BL-5C battery

621
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Oh yes

622
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So

623
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Just to go back to that conversation

624
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Of the cell phone

625
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So the battery exploded

626
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I then

627
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah

628
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I think I played the comment on the daily source code

629
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Candyman Luke from Nokia said

630
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Hey dude

631
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
We're going to get in touch with this guy

632
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Nokia did

633
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And

634
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Didn't really hear much

635
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I did receive a follow-up comment

636
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
But it's like

637
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Okay

638
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
First they said it's impossible

639
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And then they said

640
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Well, please send us the phone

641
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And so it looks like some investigation has been going on

642
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
As Nokia today

643
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Issue to product advisory

644
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
For the Nokia branded BL-5C battery

645
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
In fact, it's a battery

646
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Industrial company limited of Japan

647
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Between December 2005

648
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
November 2006

649
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
This product advisory is not applied

650
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Any other blah, blah, blah, blah

651
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Nokia has identified

652
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Then in very rare cases

653
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The Nokia branded BL-5C batteries

654
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Subject to the product advisory

655
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Could potentially experience overheating

656
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Initiated by a short circuit

657
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Well, charging

658
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Causing the battery to dislodge

659
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Hahaha

660
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Nokia is working closely with

661
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And we'll be cooperating with relevant authorities

662
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
To investigate the situation

663
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Dislodge

664
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
How about shoot across the fricking room

665
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And explode in a plume of smoke

666
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And fire and flame

667
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Dislodge

668
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah, that's one way of putting it

669
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Cricky

670
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Talk about

671
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Crisis management

672
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I see

673
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Well, it's sent me this on a couple other people sent me that

674
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So apparently this is how many batteries are involved here

675
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
46 million batteries are being recalled

676
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I've checked I don't have any of the

677
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Offending BL-5C's

678
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But I'll betcha

679
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I will betcha that it was a BL-5C

680
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I don't know for sure

681
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But I'll betcha that it was one of those that exploded

682
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And

683
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And dislodged

684
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So you heard it here on the Charlie first

685
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
As far as I'm concerned friends

686
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
First time right here on the Daily Source Code

687
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Tonight you'll bet a step

688
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Rebellion you ruin

689
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Peace and love

690
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
When the day in spite of all your lives

691
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
We'll come from the land of the ice

692
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And snow from the midnight sun

693
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Without springs glow

694
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
The hammer of the gods

695
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
We'll drive all ships to new land

696
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
To fight the war

697
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Seem crime

698
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Bellhalla

699
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I am coming

700
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Oh my sweet

701
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
With this thing all

702
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
My only goal will be the West and shot

703
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
We'll come from the land of the ice

704
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And snow from the midnight sun

705
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Without springs glow

706
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
How soft your feet so green

707
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Can whisper tales of God

708
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
How we can't

709
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
The ties of war

710
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We are your overload

711
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Always sweet

712
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
With fresh sugar

713
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Our only goal will be the West and shot

714
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
We'll come from the end of the ice

715
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And snow from the midnight sun

716
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Without springs glow

717
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The hammer of the gods

718
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
We'll drive all ships to new land

719
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
To fight the war

720
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Seem crime

721
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Bellhalla

722
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I am coming

723
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Onward sweet

724
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
With fresh sugar

725
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Our only goal will be the West and shot

726
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And shot

727
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And tight you've been a star

728
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Rebuild all your ruin

729
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
He's the love we'll win the day

730
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And spite of all your new days

731
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
That one's also for the pot safe music network

732
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And Wilson in the immigrant song

733
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Classic Led Zeppelin

734
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
By the way, I was talking about the Elton John

735
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And Wilson collaboration that's on the PMN

736
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You said, yeah, we're two St. Peter

737
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's the first song ever learned to play on the guitar

738
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I didn't even know it was an Elton John original

739
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Go figure, learn something new every day

740
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
From our house, we're coming out of September 11th

741
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And Wilson embracing the pot safe music platform

742
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And revolution to the immigrant song

743
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
That's it for today

744
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The source code for today

745
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Tomorrow traveling

746
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Maybe I'll check in from Fire Island

747
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Certainly with a blog post at curry.com

748
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000

Hey, have yourselves a wet Wednesday

752
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
In a nice Tuesday

753
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Another podgeo podcast
