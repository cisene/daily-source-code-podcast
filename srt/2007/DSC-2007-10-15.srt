1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey Adam, you're listening to Box, Carral Prelude, Kedia, Goethe Vatter, in Avikite.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I figured this would be great in honor of the new Pod Show, Putstom, and coincidentally,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
it is B-W-V-672, and B-W-V for music people.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They know it stands for Bach, Verca, Verde, Cycness, which is basically the chronological listing

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
of Bach works.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And 672 is also the chronological listing for today's episode of The Daily Source Code.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's pretty good to be here.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The next step before something in the TSA, you know what that means.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Don't you know what that means?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Do you know what the letters to D-K-S?

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
They stand for...

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Back!

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,800
Copper wins...

14
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,600
ублиive dollars was made winterpped with fire,

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,320
but next she was really contenting my youth.

16
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,500
I like that you think I'm slaying you into squeezed music...

17
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,000
Hot Casting tears in Adam Curry!

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,300
Tell me, I know...

19
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,600
I need you to know...

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,600
to know sometimes they're alone forever

21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,600
I needed to say in the impossible way

22
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Sometimes through my window

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I wanted to show how we live in that ground

24
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
It's on how you love the ride

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,600
And if you want me so

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,600
You better tell me so

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Because I want you to see the call of me

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
That can't let go

29
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Let me know

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I needed to try as long as going by

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Sometimes now you need to

32
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I never could say in the way

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I wanted to say

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,600
But do you ever do you?

35
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
So tell me I know

36
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
How to make you go

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Sometimes now you're alone forever

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
And if you want me so

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,600
You better tell me so

40
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Because I want you to see the call of me

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
That can't let go

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Let me know

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Because you see the call of me

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,600
That can't let go

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,600
And if I want you to see the call of me

46
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,600
That can't let go

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
But do you ever do you?

48
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
So tell me I know

49
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
But do you ever do you?

50
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
So tell me I know

51
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
How to make you go

52
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Sometimes now you're alone forever

53
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
But do you ever do you?

54
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
So tell me I know

55
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
How to make you go

56
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Sometimes now you're alone forever

57
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I needed to try as long as going by

58
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Sometimes now you need to

59
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,600
I never could say the way I wanted to say

60
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,600
But do you ever do you?

61
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,600
So tell me I know

62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
How to make you go

63
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,600
And if you want me so

64
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,600
You better tell me so

65
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Because I want you to see the call of me

66
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,600
That can't let go

67
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,600
And if you're alone forever

68
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
You know as the fire rates

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Let me know

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Perfect Monday morning song for the source code

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
If this had been done my west life

72
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
It would have been number one in the charts

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
I love those guys

74
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Fantastic

75
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
How are you doing?

76
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Welcome to episode number 672 of the daily source code

77
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Coming to you from the curry manner

78
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
On the west side of G town

79
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
The affluent suburb of Surrey known as Guilford in the United Kingdom

80
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Okay

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
What's this?

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I did a Friday show

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
And here we are doing a Monday show

84
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
What is wrong?

85
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Well Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday are planned London days for me

86
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
So maybe I can eat out another show tomorrow

87
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I told you it's going to be messed up until the end of the year

88
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,600
However, I have been extremely motivated all weekend long

89
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,600
I've been receiving tons of feedback regarding

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Republican presidential candidate

91
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Ron Paul, Dr. Ron Paul

92
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Some great feedback on him and on politics in general

93
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,600
I know that a lot of you tune in to listen to crap about naked pictures

94
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
And I always try to sleep in some of that

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
But got to do a little bit of the politics

96
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
It's been on my brain, you know?

97
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
It's just like it's been fizzling around in there

98
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
This is your brain

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,600
And this is your brain on the daily source code

100
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Yeah, that's exactly what it felt like

101
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Saturday morning really when comments started rolling in

102
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
And the weather was kind of crap Saturday

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
I did something very decant

104
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Just for me all for myself

105
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Just to chill out a little bit

106
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
I really needed to rest my brain

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,600
You know the only way I can really take my mind off of everything

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Is to go flying

109
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,600
So the weather was scheduled to be much better for Sunday

110
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
And I thought what a perfect opportunity

111
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
I'm going to go get my haircut

112
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
You know, I'm a pretty loyal guy

113
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Not only that, but I'm definitely afraid of someone

114
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Fucking up my hair because for those of you

115
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Been listening to the show for a couple of years now

116
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
I believe it was in 2006

117
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,600
The end of 2006 when I went to Tony and Guy

118
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Better known as Sam and Dave

119
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Tony and Guy

120
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,600
That fabulous chain of hair salons

121
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
And it completely ruined my hair

122
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,600
And it stayed that way for like a year

123
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
It was host

124
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,600
So I vowed I would never go to anyone else

125
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
But my man Peter who lives in Rotterdam

126
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Not far from the airfield coincidentally

127
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,600
So the most decant thing I could think of

128
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Was to fly to have my hair done

129
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
By the way, you know, I'm 43 now

130
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
And I have all of my hair

131
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
So I don't I'm proud of it

132
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,600
I don't mind telling you that I will literally fly to the guy

133
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I trust most with taking care of the hair

134
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,600
So for me this is a big adventure time

135
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I'd have him flown in a couple of weeks

136
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Gonna make the crossing crossing the English channel

137
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
You know, Hitler never successfully did it

138
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Well he crossed the channel, but he never actually landed

139
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,600
So and I got to tell you I love getting up

140
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Actually I went Sunday

141
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
The weather was much nicer

142
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Although better on the other side on the Dutch side

143
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Than the UK side

144
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,600
There's nothing nicer than a Sunday morning

145
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Around 930 10 o'clock in the morning

146
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
You arrive at the airfield

147
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
And you know there's no one is really I think the airfield

148
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Officially is closed until 10

149
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,600
And you know there's just it's quiet

150
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
No one's there and you know around 1015

151
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
You might hear one airplane somewhere

152
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
The distance or someone taking off

153
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
And people are all kind of like hey good morning

154
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
How are you doing?

155
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Friendly we're all working on our planes doing our checks and stuff

156
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,600
And all of us maybe all of us but three of us

157
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
So I've done my flight planning and everything

158
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
And done the life jacket

159
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Which of course is a good idea

160
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Since I'm flying over water in a single-engine airplane

161
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,600
And I made the trek over

162
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
It was actually the cloud base

163
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
The lower than I expected leaving was about a thousand feet

164
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
And it wasn't really cloud

165
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
It was more like a misty haze

166
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,600
So caution of course had to be taken into account

167
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Because you know it said the weekend all kinds of idiots are out there flying

168
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Put it at the nice 3000 feet for the crossing

169
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
And Patricia had made a thermos bottle of coffee for me

170
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
So you know just cruise along that portion of the trip

171
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Which is over the over water

172
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,600
We got 45 maybe 50 minutes, 45 minutes probably

173
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,600
And because you're flying over in this case very calm water

174
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
It's just you know calm

175
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,600
You can put the autopilot on and kick back and relax

176
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
And there's just nothing like flying your own aircraft

177
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Defying all laws of gravity

178
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
And of course taking advantage of a whole bunch of other laws

179
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
That mother nature is given to us

180
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Sipping my coffee

181
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
It was fantastic, arrived at Rotterdam

182
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,600
And I hope you don't mind me saying I'm getting really good at this landing stuff

183
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I can just have the baby

184
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Just kiss the tarmac

185
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
And Renee was on the ground frequency

186
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Remember Renee the guy that gave a shout out to me

187
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
The other the other week when I was in Rotterdam

188
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
So he was on the ground frequency

189
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
He said hey Adam when you come back

190
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
And I said you got to do them just going to go get my haircut

191
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
He said when you come back come on up to the tower

192
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,600
So I went to see Peter and he of course took great care of me

193
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Made me feel like a man again

194
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Back to Rotterdam airport

195
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
When I was at the tower

196
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
That was quite a treat actually

197
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
You don't get invited up to the tower very often

198
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
And I was fun sat there for a little bit

199
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Drink a cup of coffee with the guys

200
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
You know some real like hangar talk airplane

201
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Crap which was nice

202
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
And wow what a great view

203
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
And what a fantastic airfield Rotterdam

204
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
It's so diverse with

205
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
737's leading trans obvious

206
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
737's interspersed with

207
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
You know single engine aircraft

208
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Just a whole bunch of stuff going on

209
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
So I left it five p.m. a local time

210
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Which would be 4 p.m. here 3 p.m.

211
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
UTC

212
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
About an hour and a half is what it takes

213
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
You know there was no wind to speak of

214
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
If anything a bit of crosswind on a 2-4 runway

215
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
But really nothing

216
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
So I couldn't take advantage of any extra speed

217
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
So it still took me the hour and a half

218
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
And as I got closer to the United Kingdom

219
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
It got increasingly harder to see anything

220
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
In fact by the time I was a beam of

221
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Manston which is the very

222
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Easternly tip of the island

223
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
It was so easy

224
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
I was still at 3,000 feet

225
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
So you know I started to cruise

226
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Decend down to 2,400 feet

227
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
That's the maximum is 2.5,000 feet

228
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Otherwise you interrupt with the

229
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
With the Heathrow and and Gattwick zones

230
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
So you have to stay underneath that under

231
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Their TMA as it's called

232
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
And visibility was probably about

233
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
1 kilometer which means

234
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,600
I was I could look down and I could see the ground

235
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
But looking ahead pretty much nothing

236
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
So got pretty exciting

237
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
And of course this is end of the day

238
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Sunday people coming back from from France from the 2K

239
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
And this is one of the busiest air corridors

240
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
In the world actually

241
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,600
So crossing overhead at Big and Hill

242
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Was pretty busy 4,5 aircraft

243
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
No one could see each other

244
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I was really happy I bought that portable T-Cast system

245
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,600
The air collision or collision avoidance system

246
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
There you go

247
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Collision avoidance

248
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
So I you know I had a little bit of

249
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
A situational awareness of where everybody was in conjunction

250
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
With the controller was telling me

251
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,600
But it was pretty much instrument flying to be quite honest

252
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,600
And got it back down to Farrow

253
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Boy I'm sure glad I know where the hell that thing is

254
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Because it was the visibility was so poor by the time I got there

255
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
I couldn't see the airfield

256
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
I couldn't see the airfield

257
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
So I was almost on top of it

258
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,600
But as I said it completely invigorates me to do that stuff

259
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
And boy do I feel alive

260
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
But today as well it just carried over

261
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
And we got lots of stuff to talk about

262
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
I mean tons

263
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Hey Adam it's Alex from podcast junkie UK

264
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
I've got £8.50 worth of eBay purchase

265
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Flight simulator on my screen

266
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
And a crappy microphone but I still don't need a transmitter

267
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Anyway

268
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Of course they want us frightened

269
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Cast your mind back to the 911 events

270
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I remember sitting on my PC with this news aggregator I had

271
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,600
So what podcast junkie UK is talking about here

272
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I think

273
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Still about conspiracy theories

274
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,600
And manipulation of the messaging and media

275
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
And probably the truth

276
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
I gotta tell you I'm starting to graduate a bit

277
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Out of the conspiracy theories

278
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Moving closer towards some real resolutions

279
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
More on that in a moment

280
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Is all these news feeds coming from all over the world

281
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
And at the same time these feeds were coming in

282
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,600
About the anthrac scare and all that kind of stuff

283
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,600
But even at that time while the

284
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
911 events were going on

285
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
And the anthrac shit and all of that

286
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,600
There were already already news articles about Iran

287
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,600
And the nuclear threat

288
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,600
And just like the start of the zeitcoice movie

289
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
With the religious stuff

290
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
You know laying the ground, laying the seed for them

291
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
For what's really going to be the main course

292
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
So they've all got us frightened

293
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,600
And no one's going to kick up a stink about going into Iran

294
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
There aren't going to be any protest marches

295
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Like they were before going to Iraq

296
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
And that's what it is

297
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Anyway

298
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
I can't do it as well as a comic strip blogger

299
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Oh here it comes

300
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Fuck you Adam

301
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Anyway

302
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Thank you

303
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
It works well in combination with the kind regards to your loved ones

304
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
That's fantastic

305
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Yeah

306
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Yeah, dude, absolutely

307
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Yeah, I think I think we got to be really careful and keep our eyes peeled

308
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Well, this other stuff is going on

309
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,600
We really cannot afford to all of a sudden invade Iran

310
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
This makes absolutely no sense

311
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
But there is change of foot

312
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
I believe

313
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Oh, by the way, some feedback from Germany

314
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
I do want to keep that currency

315
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
This will be moving in pretty soon

316
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Hey, it's very first of all

317
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Sorry for the cracking sound

318
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
I did not buy on my bluetooth headset

319
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
And my mobile phone

320
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
On my headset, voice mail box

321
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Alright, alright

322
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
So Ali is calling in through his bluetooth headset

323
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Connected to his mobile phone into a voice mail box

324
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Yeah, Ali sound quality

325
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
About a four my friend

326
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Away home

327
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Right, so here's Ali from Bonds

328
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,600
And I did want to comment on your plan

329
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,600
To open up the Pacho journey office down at Pacho

330
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Right choice

331
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
I love Berlin

332
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
And Pacho

333
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Pacho

334
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Pacho, Pacho, Pacho, Pacho

335
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Pacho is a great place for a bit

336
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Yeah, to friend and I'm doing a grant

337
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Opening party down there

338
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Just give me a call

339
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Send me a mail

340
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600

Is

343
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
And yeah

344
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
What a party would do

345
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Want to be part of the crowd

346
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
And want to be part of Pacho Germany

347
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Want to hook up with you guys

348
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Make some party

349
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Here you go

350
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
And by the way, I'm a folder

351
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
And talk to you I am curious

352
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
What's that in German dude?

353
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
We got to have the German version of that

354
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Ficti Adam Curry

355
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Yeah, and I realized

356
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
I think it was

357
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Earlier last week when someone asked me if we're going to do a party

358
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Yeah, of course we're going to replicate the way we rolled out in the United Kingdom

359
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
So that means we're going to have a

360
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Well, in the UK we had a draft and darts session

361
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Which means beer and darts

362
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,600
So maybe in Germany we have a broad force doing beer session or something like that

363
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Whatever it is

364
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
It'll be a

365
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Basically an open-house open bar

366
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Everyone come on by

367
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Hang out. Let's talk. Let's meet

368
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm getting a lot of phone call

369
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
So that means there's a lot of interest very excited about that

370
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
And yes, I'm happy that everyone else likes the

371
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Like the idea of going to Potsdam

372
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Because I think it's going to be a nice home for Pacho Germany

373
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Or PSP Potsdam

374
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Pacho

375
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,600
So feedback on the Fubar Friday football

376
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
I forget what it was

377
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
What the hell did you call it?

378
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Friday football

379
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Adam Curry

380
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Folder

381
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Okay, that would be one strike against the football Friday report

382
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Got a very interesting call

383
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
From parky

384
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Hi Adam it's parky taking in

385
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Sorry about the voice I'm up to my neck in a cold

386
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
And it's really starting to fucking piss me off

387
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Anyway, I've just been listening to your Friday show

388
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
And well, frankly, I don't really give a flying fuck

389
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
The Americans actually go in for this time

390
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
It's going to be better than the Simeon moron

391
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
They've got there at the moment

392
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
But it must pick up on one point

393
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Second amendment to the Constitution

394
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
The right to bear arms

395
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
It's really about time that that really got modernised

396
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
I'm looking at some websites here with statistics

397
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
About a number of people who have been killed in America

398
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
By guns over the last ten years

399
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Also in 2004, for example, five people got murdered

400
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
By with a gun in New Zealand

401
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
56 in Australia

402
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
73 in England and Wales

403
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
344 in the United States

404
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Yeah, parky, I just got a stop for one second there, dude

405
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Okay, so there's two things that play here

406
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,600
One is the second amendment and what that means to the United States

407
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,600
And second is having guns on the street essentially

408
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Now very nice that you make this comparison

409
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,600
And dude, I have guns, I don't have hand guns

410
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
I've got classic guns that I've collected

411
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
I'm not a shooter of guns, but I'm not against guns

412
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
And I'm certainly not against the second amendment

413
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Which we'll get into in a second

414
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
But to cite statistics

415
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Based upon numbers like that

416
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600
You just cannot, I don't care what it is

417
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
You cannot compare

418
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Those numbers based upon the size of the countries

419
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
There's over 300 million people in America

420
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,600
And in New Zealand, I think maybe it's six

421
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
So that's not really a fair comparison

422
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
You can do it by percentage if you want

423
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
That's one way

424
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
But just blanketly saying

425
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Oh, there's 10 or 11,000 deaths by hand guns

426
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Or by guns in America

427
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Compared to four in New Zealand

428
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
That just doesn't compute

429
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Okay, it just doesn't work that way

430
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
That's not how statistics work

431
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
So let's just take that off the table right there

432
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Is opposed to say it's godless America

433
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Okay, let's go into a little bit more detail

434
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
On some of the stats here

435
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Everyone knows about the

436
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
The Virginia Tech University

437
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Blacksburg, Virginia, the worst mass shooting in American history

438
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Yeah, what was that place in Ireland

439
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
The one that the boom town rat saying the song about

440
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I don't like Mondays

441
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Let me see, yeah that was

442
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Wasn't that part of this part of the world?

443
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Huh

444
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Shit does happen dude

445
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Gumman shoots 47 people

446
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Killing 32 before killing himself

447
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
And everyone's heard of the column by

448
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
And thing where 23 people

449
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
We're wounded 12, 12 were killed

450
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
And a teacher on top

451
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Yeah, you just pick one at random

452
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Okay, so let's say to your team open fire inside

453
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
I'm more killing five and wounding four

454
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Before being killed by police

455
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Yeah, it's some kid just shoot another kid here

456
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
In the United Kingdom of North

457
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Just recently, I mean, guns

458
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Are a fact of life

459
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
I think it has very little to do with the second amendment

460
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,600
You know guns get misused for all kinds of things

461
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Again, I'm not a gun owner

462
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
I don't walk around with guns

463
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
I don't, did they scare me?

464
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
But the second amendment is something else

465
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Listen to the rest of parkie here

466
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
In February this year, in November

467
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
21st, 2004, and to open the roof

468
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
With an SKS for salt rifle

469
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Killing six other hunters

470
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Another one at random

471
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
July 5th, Cleveland, Ohio

472
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Apparently angry about fireworks

473
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
I've been noisy for the July party

474
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Shot three people to death

475
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,600
And wounded two others

476
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Why? Why?

477
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
When a wake up and get rid of the guns

478
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
More controls, get rid of them

479
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Wake up America, your kids are dying

480
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Do something about it

481
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Okay, now rent over blue pill

482
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Fuck you Adam Curry

483
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Oh, yes

484
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
I thought you'd give it up on the weed

485
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
A big misconception

486
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I didn't give up on the weed

487
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
I've been trying to give up on the tobacco

488
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
That's two very different things

489
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
I'm not quite sure how people got confused with that

490
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Okay, 50,000 deaths

491
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Due to automobiles last year in the United States

492
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Yet no one's calling for removal of automobiles

493
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,600
5,000 deaths in the UK

494
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Due to road accidents

495
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Many of those involved alcohol

496
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
I mean, we can keep on going

497
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
It's just not an argument

498
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
It's just not an argument cigarette smoking

499
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Yeah, sure there's all kinds of regulation

500
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
It's still going to kill hundreds of thousands of people

501
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,600
You know, it's just the fact of life

502
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,600
But for America to wake up, yeah, absolutely America has to wake up

503
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
But I don't think it's about getting guns off the streets

504
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
It's about taking our country back

505
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,600
It's about taking back the proper responsible role of government

506
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,600
A particular federal government that we need to wake up to

507
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,600
And then I think a lot of these things are going to start to fall into place

508
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Because there's reasons for for huge amount of guns

509
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
On the street

510
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
There's reasons for it

511
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
They're available

512
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Really, it's not just because they're available

513
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
There are many other reasons

514
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,600
And I think we just might have someone who can help us out of this mess

515
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Or at least to pull a lot of Americans together

516
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Who have similar ideas

517
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
And if it's not this time around, it'll be the next time around

518
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
That in a second but first

519
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Oh, yes

520
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Let's have a word with the nylon

521
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Spreading the news with the smile on

522
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Where they're all all right

523
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
We're in your polite, let's listen

524
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
He is back ladies and gentlemen

525
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
He's the ex-pad who lives in London

526
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
He's from New York and he's against everything I say

527
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Alright, this is take to Adam

528
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
This is the nylon I got cut off

529
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
So let me try to do this quickly

530
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Through many brain cells

531
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
The ameral too

532
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,600
To have nylon agree with CSB is pretty frightening don't you agree?

533
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Arrow is the creation of a Canadian thing tank or the phrase

534
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Institute that has $10 million of funding

535
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Not likely to be the hotbed of revolutionary thinking

536
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Ask the sales reason because you don't have a marketing reason about buying power index

537
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
BPI

538
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Which subdivide the US into nine countries

539
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Now there's a conspiracy theory

540
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Let's subdivide the US into nine countries

541
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Pick your theories

542
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Central bank debt

543
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Can't even start that one

544
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Only to say 45% of the central bank debt

545
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,600
M1 supply is held by Japan and China

546
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Those are not the people you would have holding your debt

547
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,600
If you're planning to overtake the world in terms of money supply

548
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
What happens if they sell?

549
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
We go down

550
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Bath theory

551
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,600
To control of money is not the problem

552
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Money wealth is not the problem with corruption

553
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Is control of the information highway that you have

554
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,600
That you're using just like the man to send out information

555
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
Peace and meal to influence people

556
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
With really no basis of it

557
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
You're in bed with the man Adam

558
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
I'm going to just cut the British telecom

559
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
You're a partner, you're a great partner

560
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Imagine if you're a podcasting in 2001 when B.T. was suing to say

561
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
They own the hyperlink

562
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
B.T.

563
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Okay, nylon, hold on a second

564
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
A couple things here, first of all

565
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Regarding the

566
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Amiro

567
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
You tell me this is like a figment of my imagination

568
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Or this is come up dreamed up by some think tank

569
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Ah

570
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Someone I gotta find this

571
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Someone sent me

572
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
That link

573
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
That I was looking for to

574
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,600
President of Mexico on Larry King live

575
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
I can't find it at the moment

576
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Where he literally said he literally said the Amiro is something

577
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
That could come into play

578
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Sometime down the road

579
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
So it's not just some think tank that's coming up

580
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
Why can't I find this crap

581
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
I let's listen to the rest of nylon here

582
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
And then I'll look for that in the meantime

583
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
I'll just say every time you click on a hyperlink

584
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
You have to pay them

585
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Now if you're a podcast I can imagine you blowing your stack

586
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,600
But no they put money in your bag now and they're okay

587
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
They're the man

588
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
The only difference between the man and you

589
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
They got what you want

590
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
I see the same values and behaviors

591
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
As you as the man

592
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
This is the nylon I'm going to take a white pill

593
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
If you just give me a headache

594
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
For this stuff

595
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
And finally one more over promise under delivery

596
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Where the suck less research

597
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,600
I don't see any revolutionary change in customer attitudes and marketing

598
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
The suck less

599
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Come on Adam and finally the daily source code is not daily tell us what it is

600
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
And commit to it

601
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
But nylon

602
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
The A new one you're called

603
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
You know what nylon

604
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
You're just not making any sense dude

605
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
You're just not making any sense anymore

606
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Oh

607
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
I wish I could find that

608
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
That's so stupid

609
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Maybe I'll have it tomorrow for you

610
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Working for the man

611
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Look dude

612
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
There's no first of all

613
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
There's no way we can ever

614
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Get anything accomplished without

615
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
At least using the man

616
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
By the way

617
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
British telecom is not the man

618
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,600
It's a huge organization that was once part of British government

619
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,600
That operates accordingly

620
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
And I think they're actually

621
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Pretty forward thinking in revolutionary

622
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,600
To even want to have anything to do with us

623
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Considering some of the content

624
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Which by itself is revolutionary

625
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
It does probably not adhere to all standards of

626
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,600
And norms that

627
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
British telecom is used to

628
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Is used to I guess

629
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
I don't know

630
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
I can't even give

631
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
A clearer bottle to what you're saying

632
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
It just it just makes no sense

633
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Good to have you back though

634
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Dude if I think you're really the patriot that

635
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
You probably are

636
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
You'd probably be responding differently

637
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
Like some of these people

638
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Hi

639
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
My name is Kathleen Jagadnick

640
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
I'm a run Paul Supporter

641
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
And I hear that Adam Curry is

642
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Working for a candidate to endorse

643
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I would like to please suggest that Adam Curry do

644
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Some more research and I'll find that Dr. Paul

645
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Is really the only candidate running who's worthy of people's votes

646
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Specifically

647
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
The number two call

648
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
I already called the run Paul campaign

649
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
And they said that if Adam wants to interview Dr. Paul

650
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
He needs to request the interview himself

651
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
That they don't

652
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
They don't come and ask for interview

653
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
So Adam needs to contact them

654
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
And their phone number is

655
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
So

656
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
For those of you who haven't heard

657
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
The previous episodes of the show

658
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
I basically put out a call

659
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
And said, you know, a home I'll tell you what you have to say

660
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
No, she's just coming out of phone numbers

661
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
I put out a call and said, you know, I want to talk to this guy

662
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,600
I think I really want to get behind him and endorse him

663
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
And I'm pretty sure I could help him out

664
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
In a number of ways

665
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Primarily with fund raising

666
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Which is still how elections are won

667
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
It's how we choose our presidents in the United States

668
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Hillary Clinton said to have

669
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
A hundred million dollars by the end of this quarter

670
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
That buys a lot of advertising time

671
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
So there's a couple things we can do

672
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
One is just purely fundraising

673
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Raise money

674
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
I think there's enough Americans we can reach through our shows

675
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
That we can

676
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Get tons of money

677
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Or I apparently said a shit ton of money

678
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
But also

679
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Just the pure reach of

680
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Independent media itself

681
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,600
You know, and we maybe we don't need so many different

682
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Advertising campaigns

683
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
In fact, I was thinking we've got to set up some viral campaigns

684
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
And I am going to get behind Dr. Ron Paul

685
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
And you'll find out why in a second

686
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
And I do have some ideas

687
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Anyway, I sent out the call and said look

688
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
You know, I really want to talk to this guy on the show

689
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
On the daily source code

690
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Could someone please

691
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Again touch with me

692
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,600
And the reason why I did that is not because

693
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Well, I am kind of lazy

694
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,600
It wasn't for any reason other than

695
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,600
I was interested to see how well put together

696
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
This campaign really is

697
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
And if they really are tuned into the internet

698
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
So I put out the call on Friday

699
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
And here's what I received today

700
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Hi, my name is Don Rasmussen

701
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
I'm a special assistant doctor

702
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Ron Paul for a credential campaign

703
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,600
And I was hoping that Adam could give me a call at 4-2

704
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
So, is another phone number home?

705
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
I'm just going to read it that for a second

706
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Zero

707
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,600
We've had a lot of requests for folks who would like us to

708
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Avail ourselves the opportunity to have Dr. Paul in the show

709
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
And that's what we'd be very interested in doing

710
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Excellent

711
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Excellent!

712
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
We only took one weekend

713
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
And already these guys are in touch with me

714
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
You want to get them on the show

715
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
So I'm going to put in a call a little bit later on today

716
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
I'm not even head courters is in Texas

717
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
I presume so I'll have to wait a couple hours

718
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
And we'll get them on the show

719
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
This week then, fantastic

720
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Yeah, I don't scare you out again

721
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
From Vegas just called to see what's up

722
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
And also, I wanted to actually

723
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,600
I wanted to find out a little bit more about this guy, Ron Paul

724
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
There's a huge grass roof thing going on

725
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
In Vegas, everywhere you turn on

726
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
The overpasses people are putting

727
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Like homemade funds that are spray painted on

728
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Like a sheet or something or

729
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
You know, papers, cardboard

730
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
So, there's tons of things going on

731
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
It's a grass roof

732
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
It's behind this guy and I'm just blown away

733
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,600
It's like a really, like a really underground hip band

734
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
That's what's going down with this guy

735
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,600
It's very interesting

736
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
I'm sure there's a podcast out there

737
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Unfortunately, I've been working my ass off

738
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,600
So, I haven't been able to search for any podcast

739
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
If there's a channel where people are promoting

740
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Not only, you know, you know,

741
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
You know, Ron Paul

742
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
But different candidates that will be amazing

743
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
I will define that

744
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
If you have any information about that

745
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
If you could let people know that would

746
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Really help educate people and let people

747
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
Make it on the decision that will be great

748
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,600
And if there's a Ron Paul podcast

749
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,600
I let's know about it

750
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
If there's a RuPaul podcast

751
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Not so much

752
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Fuck you

753
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
That was alright

754
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Yeah, excellent. Gary. Thank you so much, man

755
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Gary Alexander

756
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
From the ultimate podcast

757
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Yeah, well, I think that this show may become part of that

758
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Of course, you can go to RonPaul2008.com

759
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
There's a

760
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
I spent some of some of Saturday going through a lot of the videos

761
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
I really like it when he's being interviewed

762
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Dr. Ron Paul that is when he's being interviewed or when he's

763
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
In a debate

764
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
When he does his own speeches

765
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,600
He's, I don't know, it's not quite as powerful as I'd like it to be

766
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
And the message seems to be

767
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
You know, a little

768
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Watery, I don't know what I can't really explain it

769
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Maybe he's just not fantastic at

770
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Giving speeches

771
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
And it is of course

772
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Something all the other candidates are expert at

773
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
But when it comes down to really delivering the message

774
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
And answering questions I've been quite impressed with

775
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,600
With this Republican candidate from Texas

776
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,600
No less

777
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
Played a couple of bits for Patricia

778
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
She's like, crap, that's what you're always saying

779
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
I say, yep

780
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
You better believe it

781
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
And not a single

782
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Negative comment through email, voice mail

783
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Otherwise yet about this guy

784
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
So I want you to check him out

785
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
RonPaul2008.com

786
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
I truly believe

787
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
That his

788
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Basis said in constitutionalism

789
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Can really bring America

790
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Roundback

791
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
To the initial

792
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
And the original goals of the founding fathers

793
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Who put this together

794
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Not that long ago when you think about it

795
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
In the meantime

796
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
In the world out there

797
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,600
New rules proposed by the TSA

798
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Transportation Security Administration

799
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Check this out

800
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,600
All airline passengers would need advanced permission

801
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Before flying into through

802
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Or over the United States

803
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Regardless of citizenship or the airline's national origin

804
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
I saw this originally on

805
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Slash dot

806
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
And so this is a proposal

807
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
This is fucking crazy

808
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
The new rules mean information must be submitted

809
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
72 hours before departure

810
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Only those given clearance will get a boarding pass

811
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,600
TSA estimates that 90% of all travel reservations

812
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Or will be final by then

813
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
This is ludicrous

814
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
So now we're going to be

815
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
Examine if we can even fly into

816
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Into my own country

817
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Scrazy

818
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
Absolutely crazy

819
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:37,600
So the

820
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,600
And here's what I'm learning slowly

821
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Is that all of these issues

822
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
You know all of these conspiracy theories

823
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
All the things that we're talking about

824
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
They really come down to some very basic principles

825
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
And it really is how

826
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,600
The United States government has just grown out of control

827
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,600
And I would say

828
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
And this is one of the things I found in my research

829
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
In fact, I'm going to give you this as homework

830
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Homework for this week is to watch

831
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,600
A documentary made by Aaron Russo

832
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Aaron Russo

833
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Unfortunately passed away in 2006

834
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,600
But he began his career

835
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
He managed to bet midler

836
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Produced Tony Award winning shows

837
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Let's see

838
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
He the member the Manhattan transfer

839
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
That was his creation he managed them

840
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,600
He managed a lot of people

841
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,600
But he also produced the rose with bet midler

842
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,600
He has six Academy Award nominations

843
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Seven Golden Globe nominations

844
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Kind very very well respected

845
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
And he did a documentary

846
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Let me see

847
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Let me see

848
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
I'm just scrolling through

849
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Through my notes here

850
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
And this documentary is called Freedom to Fascism

851
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,600
And it is available on on Google video

852
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,600
I'm sure it's completely

853
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
I illegally posted

854
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
But anyway you can get into it

855
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,600
And you can view it

856
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,600
I'll put the link in the show notes

857
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
It is a it is required watching

858
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
So this guy is not just any old documentary maker

859
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Or someone who threw some shit together

860
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,600
And he's my kind of guy

861
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Follow the money or follow your money

862
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
I should say

863
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,600
As he investigates a number of important points

864
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,600
As they relate to the United States Constitution

865
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,600
In particular the creation of the federal reserve

866
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,600
That's the guy who print money

867
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
For the United States of America

868
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
They have the right to print money

869
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
And determine the interest rate on the

870
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
The lending of that money to the United States

871
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,600
That's right

872
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
When the American

873
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Government needs more money

874
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,600
It gets printed but it gets printed by the federal reserve

875
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
And it gets given to them

876
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,600
With interest that has to be paid back

877
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
And that interest is

878
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Pretty much paid for by income taxes

879
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,600
When there's a whole question about income taxes all together

880
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,600
What's interesting is the federal reserve is

881
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
As much a part of the United States government

882
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
As federal express

883
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
It is in fact a commercial

884
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Entity

885
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
It is a corporation

886
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Comprised of member banks

887
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Of whom of which a list is not has never been published

888
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,600
We don't even know who's actually a member of the bank

889
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,600
So if you do follow your money and you follow it all the way back to these guys

890
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
You'll see that it's very very important

891
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
That we consider

892
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Not just

893
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Voting

894
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Ron Paul into office

895
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,600
But consider the actual message of no longer allowing the federal reserve to print the dollar

896
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
That should default back to the government

897
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
The government should be printing up money when necessary

898
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
As they're allowed to under the constitution

899
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Take it back from the banks

900
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Please and any candidate who is heavily backed by bankers and hedge funds

901
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Please consider

902
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Following your

903
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
Money

904
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
That's winded up with a mash up from achy

905
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,600
He loved it so much when I played his Banjovi remix

906
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,600
He sent me a link to a page of awesome stuff

907
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Who has a little dick?

908
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Well, GWB of course has a little dick

909
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Chaining

910
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,600
With your help we're going to share a message about the mechanism of national strength

911
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:31,600
We're broadcasting the message of tolerance

912
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
To prove

913
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a message for military

914
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
We win this war

915
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
I also have a message for all Americans

916
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
I have a small dick

917
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
Big dick

918
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Big dick

919
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Big dick

920
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Big dick

921
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Big dick

922
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Big dick

923
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Big dick

924
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
Big dick

925
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Big dick

926
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Big dick

927
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Big dick

928
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
Big dick

929
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Big dick

930
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Big dick

931
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,000
Big dick

932
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
Big dick

933
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,600
Big dick

934
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:40,600
and ladies and gentlemen of the congress, a man who can be jailed and have

935
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,940
in the state in this day is one, I can't beg that big woman who is not long enough, who is

936
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:59,020
not long enough, who is not long enough, who is welcomed as a matter of

937
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:05,020
Large horse-maw.

938
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,020
You don't want me to saw it, Jayden.

939
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,020
You don't want me to saw it, Jayden.

940
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,020
You don't want me to saw it, Jayden.

941
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,020
You don't want me to saw it, Jayden.

942
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,020
You don't want me to saw it, Jayden.

943
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,020
The land here's some in this hall of my mind, Jayden.

944
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,020
It's too small.

945
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,020
But I believe they can be resolved if I'm adequately.

946
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,020
Small things should be able to man together.

947
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,020
And I join the American people,

948
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,020
and I'm plotting your unity and resolve.

949
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,020
Small and short, small and short.

950
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
Small and short.

951
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,020
Small and short.

952
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,020
A small and short.

953
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,020
A small and short.

954
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,020
A small and short.

955
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,020
Small and short.

956
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,020
You're going to be big.

957
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,020
Big hit.

958
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,020
Every day we are called to do small things.

959
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,020
I know how painful it is to see a small thing.

960
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,020
Is there a home for me?

961
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,020
Live a chance.

962
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,020
And frankly, you have a small day.

963
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,020
You don't want me to saw it, Jayden.

964
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,020
You don't want me to saw it, Jayden.

965
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:35,020
You don't want me to saw it, Jayden.

966
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,020
You don't want me to saw it, Jayden.

967
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,020
You don't want me to saw it, Jayden.

968
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,020
You don't want me to see you.

969
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,020
You don't want me to see you.

970
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,020
You don't want me to see you.

971
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,020
You don't want me to see you.

972
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,020
You don't want me to see you.

973
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,020
You don't want me to see you.

974
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,020
You don't want me to see you.

975
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,020
You don't want me to see you.

976
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,020
You don't want me to see you.

977
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,020
You don't want me to see you.

978
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,020
Everybody on the message.

979
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,020
I have nothing more to add to that.

980
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,020
Nice.

981
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,020
Ike, way to go.

982
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,020
Short dick chaney.

983
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:19,020
George W. Bush versus 20 fingers versus offspring.

984
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,020
On a daily source code episode 672.

985
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:28,020
Okay, two more things before I wrap it up.

986
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:35,020
So the first is, I truly believe that the message of Dr. Ron Paul speaks for itself.

987
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,020
His record speaks for itself.

988
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,020
How he's voted on many major issues.

989
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:46,020
He's been a representative of the United States Congress for, since 1975, I think.

990
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,020
Guys been around for a long time.

991
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,020
Never heard of him ever.

992
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,020
So I think all we need to do is get people to at least listen.

993
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,020
You know, just be made aware of the fact that he exists.

994
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,020
If we can get him to go check out his message.

995
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,020
I think it'll be, I think it'll be easy.

996
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,020
So I think we need some creative juices here.

997
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,020
We need to have some shit that goes viral.

998
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:12,020
I mean, if the guy, if the, you know, leave Brittany alone guy can go viral.

999
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:16,020
I'm sure we can come up with something equally as smart.

1000
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:20,020
Or as with enough virality that we can get the message out.

1001
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,020
I'm thinking, you know, YouTube videos.

1002
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:27,020
You know, why couldn't we do something like, let me see.

1003
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:31,020
You know, you know, how you can do like comparisons between candidates.

1004
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:38,020
Maybe we do something a little bit of, let me see if I can, one, two, one, two.

1005
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:45,020
So he's a, you know, Dr. Ron has a, is a doctor, a proper doctor, a medical doctor,

1006
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,020
OBGYN.

1007
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,020
Is that it?

1008
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,020
He's delivered over 4,000 babies.

1009
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,020
So you could, for instance, create a viral campaign that went something that in it had

1010
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:58,020
a line that said, he's seen more beaver than Bill Clinton.

1011
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,020
I don't know.

1012
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:04,020
Something like that.

1013
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,020
So here's one, here's one thing that I'm very concerned about.

1014
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:12,020
I have seen this type of situation very close to an election before.

1015
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,020
In fact, I saw this in the Netherlands.

1016
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:20,020
I believe it was the 2000, was the 2000 elections or the 2002.

1017
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:24,020
Well, it was in the 2000s in the Netherlands.

1018
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:33,020
A guy named Pim Fortan, openly gay, highly intellectual scholar who ran with his own party

1019
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,020
to take control of the Dutch government.

1020
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:43,020
And he would have, in fact, his party won in a landslide posthumously because he was assassinated

1021
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,020
four days before the election.

1022
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:52,020
In a very peace loving country like the Netherlands, assassinated by some guy who apparently

1023
00:44:52,020 --> 00:45:00,020
was some crazy from, you know, what was he like an animal lover, some crazy ass stupid story

1024
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,020
like that.

1025
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,020
So whenever someone, and by the way, you ask any Dutchman.

1026
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,020
They will say, yeah, that guy spoke the truth.

1027
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,020
He really was talking the truth to the people.

1028
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,020
You ask any Dutchman who is cognizant of this guy.

1029
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:16,020
This party won posthumously, of course, the party fell apart because, you know, the leader

1030
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,020
was gone.

1031
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,020
So it was impossible.

1032
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:23,020
So I'm very worried about, you know, people who stand up and say, hey, wait a minute.

1033
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,020
Are we nuts?

1034
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:29,020
When it comes to the US, look at the constitution, look at how this thing has been violated,

1035
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,020
how many times, and by whom?

1036
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:36,020
And that, my friend, Parki, is why the second amendment is so critical because we need to

1037
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,020
be able to protect people like this.

1038
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:41,020
In fact, that's one of the questions I'm going to ask a doctor, Ron, if he has any

1039
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:46,020
fear that coming too close to the truth, could actually put him in physical danger.

1040
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:53,020
I truly believe it's dangerous today to speak your mind loudly and proudly in public

1041
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:56,020
places.

1042
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,020
Okay.

1043
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,020
That's enough for today.

1044
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,020
My head hurts.

1045
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,020
So tomorrow, I'm pretty sure I'll be back.

1046
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,020
We'll continue.

1047
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,020
Keep your phone calls coming.

1048
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,020
And be on the lookout for Dr. Ron Paul, Presidential candidate.

1049
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,020
On this very show, hopefully this week, if not an update, when he'll be able to.

1050
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,020
