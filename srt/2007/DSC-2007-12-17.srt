1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Imagine headphones without wires.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,880
Now their Sony's Bluetooth wireless headset, a rechargeable listening experience with 11 hours

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,320
of music playback, so you and your music are free to move.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,080
Pick up yours at Sony.com-headphones.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,560
Sony wireless headphones.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,840
Your music, I'm plugged.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,680
Radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,200
We don't need nuss.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,680
Dinkin' grins, man.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,120
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,640
Fantastic.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,040
It's Adam Curry.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,760
Hey world, we're women, we're comfortable shoes, and technology has changed the way you get your entertainment.

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,640
This is the pod show network, no big media, no excuses, no BS.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,080
We don't have to share Charlie's 701.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:05,080
Got me the strangest woman, believe me this shit's no sense, but I really get her going.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:13,880
When I take out my big tennis, record of the band that plays the blues, the band that plays the blues.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,480
She just loves my big tennis, record of a favorite blues.

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:44,440
Last night I tried to tease her, I gave her a little pinch, but she said I stopped her driving,

20
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,920
and get out that big tennis, record of the band that plays the blues, where the band

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,160
plays the blues.

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,360
She just loves my big tennis, record of a favorite blues.

23
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:06,560
I come her with kisses when we're in a love with stretch, and when she gets on excited,

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,160
she picks up my big tennis record of the band that plays the blues, where the band

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,400
plays the blues.

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:37,680
She just loves my big tennis, record of a favorite blues.

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:54,320
I got my big tennis record of the band that plays the blues, where the band that plays the blues.

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,240
She just loves my big tennis, record of a favorite blues.

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,840
That's the way to kick off the Charlie, huh?

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,400
Jackson, my big tennis, I guess those were from the days when they still had 78s,

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,040
because they were 10 inches in diameter, of course, the long playing format, and Maxi Cingle

32
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,640
came in the 12 inch, and for extra points, the single, how many inches was that?

33
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,040
It's a really important size.

34
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,880
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

35
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,880
It's a daily source code episode number 700 and one, it's Monday.

36
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:31,040
I met the man, a nice to wake up in my own bed next to my own wife, as opposed to someone else's wife.

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,560
And the cat and the dog on the bed, and it was really nice and sunshiney this morning.

38
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,360
I knew it wouldn't last and indeed now everything has gone gray.

39
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,240
It's really weird whether it almost feels like there might be some snow or definitely some

40
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:51,120
precipitation coming down, which is pretty much what it was on Saturday.

41
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,360
Those of you who don't listen to Noah Genda, the weekly show I do with John C.

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,400
I went out on Saturday for some flying, hadn't fired up the Delta Shiera for two months.

43
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,840
I looked in the logbook, November, sorry, October 15th was the last time I flew her.

44
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,200
And, you know, it's not good to have a piece of hardware sitting around, even though it's indoors

45
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,360
in a hanger and it's more or less dry and toasty warm.

46
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,560
And also, I just needed to fly.

47
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
I really did.

48
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,160
So Saturday we had about a 24-hundred-foot ceiling, and of course the weather on the temperature

49
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,800
on the ground being two degrees Celsius, every thousand feet you go up, you drop two degrees

50
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
in temperature.

51
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,960
Actually, sorry, it was about three degrees at ground level.

52
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,960
So I kept around two thousand feet under a well beneath the clouds, so even though it was

53
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,960
in freezing temperatures, there was no moisture I was hitting, because if you literally fly

54
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,000
through a cloud and it's freezing, guess what, you'll pick up ice on your wings, on your

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,800
prop and your struts and everywhere, and that's, you know, you can only do that so

56
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,680
you can only have a thin layer of ice before you start flying like a brick, but it was great.

57
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,920
And I'd spoken to the wing commander, I said, dude, you know, I haven't started this

58
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,640
thing up in two months, said no problem, just give a two full counterclockwise swings on

59
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
the prop.

60
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm sorry, clockwise, because the prop actually runs counterclockwise, so clockwise against

61
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,000
the motion that typically turns in, just so you can grease up the cylinders a little bit.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,720
I got in, primed, I turned the key and came to life immediately, God, that is so nice when

63
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
that happens.

64
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,160
I mean, you have the same thing with your car, right?

65
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,240
If you haven't started it in two months and all of a sudden, it just comes to life, magical.

66
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,920
So there were very few people flying as you can imagine, but it was great, just to get

67
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,160
up there, fly around, it's like riding a bike, I guess.

68
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,360
I still kind of remembered everything.

69
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,280
I didn't make the best landing in the world, I ballooned a little bit, but got her down

70
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,640
nice and safely and smoothly and very lightly, but with a little more runway use than

71
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
I'd expected.

72
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,920
And that was it, I had enough, you know, as you know me, I'm not a guy who just likes

73
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,160
to go fly around, I like to really be going from point A to point B. I might need, I was

74
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,200
actually maybe in considering doing a cross-channel trip this week, if not this week,

75
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,000
maybe right after Christmas, because it is the most, when the sun is shining and there's

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,200
no clouds, it's absolutely beautiful.

77
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,160
Okay, by the way, thanks to PG Kelly for suggesting, I opened up the show with my big

78
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:33,440
10 inch bull moves Jackson, it's not pod safe, but damn, damn funny.

79
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,560
PS says, PG aren't the listeners of pod show, the real boss of pod show, so in order

80
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,000
to please us, I suggest you take the rest of the year off, spend all that time with your

81
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,240
wonderful family, force yourself to spend this time now. We have no idea what we'll be

82
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
facing next year, God bless.

83
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah, sure. I don't think I could do that. I have no one to talk to about the crazy shit

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,480
I talked to you guys about. And of course not only do I talk to you, but you listen and

85
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,320
you actually talk back to me.

86
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,960
Adam, Kevin, from pod show, I'm a motion of the daily source code, I don't know what number,

87
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:13,600
I just put it on pause just now. Um, you say you had a pair of tickets or VIP tickets to

88
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,000
let's step on and you didn't go to go to some party. I'm going to talk to you like I would

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,720
any of my best friends. You're fucking crazy. You're either crazy or you're lying because there's

90
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:35,120
no way you would give up or any normal shoe and who likes rock music would give up VIP tickets

91
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,040
to see the biggest concert at the decade. There's no fucking way you do that. And if you did,

92
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,400
I don't know what to say except I know, I know you don't always say this, but you're

93
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,640
talking to Adam Curry and I do love you, but you're crazy.

94
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,480
Yeah, you might say I'm crazy. First of all, I fully believe Led Zeppelin is going on tour

95
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,040
and there's lots of indicators pointing in that direction as well. So I think there'll be ample

96
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,560
opportunity to see them on the road with Jason Bonham, of course, on drums replacing his father.

97
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,640
Second of all, this was not just any old Christmas party. This was the Pod Show London Office Christmas

98
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,720
party. And I only found out two days before the Christmas party that I had this opportunity through

99
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:29,840
my friends at Virgin Atlantic to go to the concert. And, you know, these are my friends, you know,

100
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,480
these are the people that I work with on a, well, almost daily basis. Of course, when I'm not

101
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,880
in London, it's Skype and an email. But, you know, these are the people that I see every single

102
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,160
day and we're working hard and we're always at it. And it's nice just to hang out with them unwind

103
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,960
and relax. And there's no way I was going to move the party. And of course, there's no way I'm not

104
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,600
going to show up. Arguably, I could have done a combination. But, yeah, I wanted to be there from

105
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,160
beginning to end. I thought that was more important. You know what, if you have your own company,

106
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,680
then you understand what I'm talking about. By the way, thank you very much to Ryan Randall for

107
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,920
making the fantastic logo for the wrong brand for today. You'll see it in the, in the album art

108
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,120
on the episode. If you're playing in the Pod Show, a Mashboard player, you'll see it. It's really nice.

109
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,120
I'm thinking that, well, it says fight planned ops lessons. I don't know if it should be planned or

110
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,400
perceived. Maybe we should make it perceived ops lessons. This is kind of catching, catching on.

111
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,880
And maybe what we should do is we should put these up on a flicker feed and make them,

112
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,760
make them available to anyone who wants to put them on to clothing.

113
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,200
Nah, maybe we need to control that crap. I just don't want any more projects.

114
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,760
I asked Chris McIntyre to make some t-shirts. So maybe he'll use this as a logo or maybe he'll

115
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,240
come up with something himself. Maybe we can use all kinds of different logos. That's even better,

116
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,280
probably. Because you know what? I'm just wearing the wrong t-shirt. That's right. I'm fighting planned

117
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:09,680
and perceived ops obsolescence and abstinence. Let's see. What do we have here? Oh, yeah, this

118
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,800
came in today. So disgusting. I'm just so tired of this. Well, nobody agrees with me.

119
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:25,200
Yeah, I could buy another phone at him. Lucky you. You know, I guess you're talking about this show

120
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,640
that I'm just whining about stuff. Is that it? Well, I'll say to you what I'd say to any guy calling

121
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,000
it and fuck you. And if you're going to do that, you know, at least in the naked picture.

122
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,200
This is probably about my complaints about being on the lookout list for the next 40 years.

123
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,680
So I'll have to go through an interesting ordeal coming into the United States.

124
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,800
However, I tried to enter the United States. And I'm Chris from Levittown. I got a question for you

125
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,440
with this. Oh, man, security thing. I'm wondering, I would advise this for nonsense and see if they can

126
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,920
just, you know, take it back to your country, but you're an American citizen. So you have different

127
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,160
rights. What happens if you don't cooperate? You know, don't get massive, you're, you know, mad or

128
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,080
anything like that, but just don't answer the questions you don't figure out of it. As your physical

129
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,320
answer, no. I don't have one on the side of what I want to do with you. When you ask for your

130
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,560
own, say, no, you're business. When you're saying, say, no, you're business. When you're saying, say, no,

131
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,760
you're business. When you're asking why you're here, say, no, you're business. When you're asking

132
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,080
why you're overseas. Say, no, you're business. What happens? What what happened? What would they do

133
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,080
to you? What could they do to you? It'd be interesting. I mean, I think most people follow

134
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,200
along these rules and because they think they have to, you'd mind the Patriotic is not a legal law.

135
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,760
Patriot Act would no-envoy the moment was signed. It's violates the Constitution. According to

136
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,160
the Constitution, it violates the Constitution. It's no-envoyant creation. So it's not even

137
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,600
an out of law. Although it's forced and they have the power to force it. So it might be an

138
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,480
interesting test case if you have the time to deal with it next time you come back to the

139
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,560
military. Don't cooperate. See what happens. Yeah. I'll be calling you from Gidmo is what will

140
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:10,240
happen. That is, of course, the actual reaction that this type of secondary screening evokes.

141
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,840
Of course, you want to say, like it's not your, in fact, I kind of, I think the second time in San Francisco,

142
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,080
I did say, when he asked me for a business card, I held up my passport and said, isn't this business

143
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:27,440
card enough? And I think that probably added 30 minutes onto my, my ordeal. So that's not a

144
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:34,480
very good idea. Besides, it's very misunderstood that you actually have no rights when you are

145
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,800
entering the United States, when you are at that kind of border, no man's land. You do not have

146
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,520
your civil rights. In fact, you actually subject to search and questioning by default. So you might

147
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,840
as well just do it. Again, I'm not against that. I'm not against checking out who's coming into

148
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,040
our country. That's, you know, border border control and protection is good and important for a number

149
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,520
of reasons. But not if you can't take law abiding citizens off the list. Obviously, that's not a good

150
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,600
thing. Hey, Adam, this is John and Dallas. The skull sucked the writing course of the TSA guy.

151
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,600
In the great, he probably walks around. Hey, man, in case you wonder who I am, I'm the skull

152
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,600
fucked the writing course of the TSA guy. Yes, right. You probably hear him in a child. Yeah.

153
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,280
Just listening to 69 and I am really appalled at what you're having to go through there.

154
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:31,600
I am curious. If you do request the information that got you on the on that list,

155
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,640
I'd really be interested in knowing what it is because recently with some of the things

156
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,920
you've been talking about, supporting Ron Paul, advocating a lot of things, you know,

157
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,280
calling Bush and more on, basically, it was the war and everything. I'm wondering if

158
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:59,120
it looks like it cut off in the middle there. Yeah. Maybe the only thing I can say about that

159
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,960
is a good start would be to elect Ron Paul. Every single interview or article that I read about

160
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,240
there's always a connotation saying, well, he's never going to get elected anyway. I find that

161
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,640
interesting. You know, with the election so far off with this campaign starting so incredibly early,

162
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,360
with the amount of money that he's raised, what did he do yesterday, by the way? Let's take a look.

163
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:32,560
Of course, I was posting like a crazy man on curry.com, keeping up with the donations. I know

164
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,240
it was over 18 million. Let's see what it is this more. Actually, right now, it's a 204pm on Monday.

165
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:47,840
So I'm loading up Ron Paul, 2008.com, 1718, looks like 18 million, 170,000. So probably about

166
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,080
six million dollars raised. And so this all happened yesterday on Sunday. And obviously,

167
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:01,360
this is fantastic. What a great result. I did get a call from folks at campaign HQ about a

168
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,680
number of things. They're working on Sundays, obviously. One of those about my endorsement video,

169
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,560
which I'm going to shoot tomorrow at the office in London. It's already written and ready to go.

170
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,320
So I'm very excited about that. I was contemplating maybe doing it just with the camera on my

171
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,640
Mac, but I thought, that would look so fucking YouTube. I want to make it kind of look professional.

172
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,240
What does that sound like here? Hold on. What's the, no, that's the heater. Sorry.

173
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,640
I really wanted to have some kind of stately impression. I wanted that to be good. And also,

174
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,880
so we're talking about the money bomb. And he, of course, was very excited about the amount of money. He

175
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,320
said, you know, it looks like we'll hit six or seven million, which he was pretty much on target.

176
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,720
That's thanks to RonPaul Graphs.com. What a fantastic idea. That is where you can actually see

177
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,080
the delta, I guess, between money donated on November 5th and this latest one for the Boston

178
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Tea Party. He said, you know, but it's really, we've got to come up with something new.

179
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,840
And I said, what do you mean? He said, well, we've actually had the whole back on spending,

180
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,880
because we were running out of money. Because that was, of course, my question. I said,

181
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,240
hey, dude, have you guys started spending yet? What do you, and he's like, are you kidding me?

182
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,360
We're spending millions on advertising. Of course, in the primary states, where the, the

183
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,080
primary is, will be held in the, and the caucuses and what have you? He says, we actually had

184
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,040
the whole back because we were waiting for this next money bomb. You know, we need to have a regular cash flow

185
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,320
really as soon as we can. So I'm thinking, well, he mentioned a site to me. Is it RonPaul

186
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:40,080
Money Bomb? Let me say RonPaul Money Bomb.com. Because really what we need to do is we need to raise

187
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:47,120
a million dollars a week, I think. Yeah, Ron Paul Money Bomb. Let me see if it, I think we should do

188
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,440
one of these every single week, like every Saturday, you know, and we should just try, or maybe

189
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,520
buy a weekly, but we've really got to up the frequency. It's okay if we don't do, you know,

190
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,480
five or six million dollars every single time, but these guys need to have at least a million

191
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,360
dollars a week to spend. If they're going to put any dent in anything, we really need that. So

192
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,560
I think was just a couple of, you know, a little bit of reconfiguration on one of these sites.

193
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,040
I like the RonPaul Money Bomb. You know, we have to have a weekly tally, and we can do a week

194
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,760
over a week. People like doing that. People like looking at week over week donations. We have to do

195
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,680
something that is more than just, you know, weeks, weeks on end. So maybe January 1st would be another

196
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,720
good one, but really, you know, it should just be continuous stream. Very, very important. And of course,

197
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,400
I'm still waiting for the mainstream media to pick up on RonPaul. Let's see, said he with a, a very

198
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,560
skeptical tone. Oh, what's this? A crap. Looks like the internet crapped out. It's been happening.

199
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,040
Today on on and off, by and large on and off, it's been cropping out. Okay, can't look for that right now.

200
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,800
All right, what do you do when you're in the pinch?

201
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:05,120
Comics trip. Comics trip. Comics trip. Comics trip. Comics trip. Comics trip.

202
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,440
Comics trip. Comics trip. Come on in my friend. Hiya Adam. Hello.

203
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:22,240
Oh, have you heard this? Yes. So I'm about to take a big dose of blue pills at this and that's

204
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:31,040
this is my last audio comment in year 2007. Oh. So the new eutrity was finally signed by all

205
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:38,160
eulidus last week. It's very, very important and it enables fluid operation of now and large eul.

206
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,920
Also, Ireland still could dump this treaty in a referendum speaking of Ireland. I will reveal

207
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:54,560
you a secret. I was personally active undercover in campaigning in Ireland for their nice,

208
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:03,120
niche, sorry, not nice, niche treaty referendum in 2002. This referendum could then stop eul

209
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,760
enlargement. So eul also should go to the grassroots and do campaigning and whatever it's

210
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,840
needed to help your beloved Ron Paul to get them in action from a republican party. So Mary

211
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,080
shopping Christmas and a happy new year 2008 to you Adam. Carrie. That's a totally new year.

212
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,000
Yo. Yo. Well, I don't think European nationals can do much to help. You don't even see

213
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,800
Ron Paul. They don't even know who he is over here. Except maybe the people who listen to this show.

214
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:39,120
There's, I mean, it's all Clinton Obama, Giuliani. Maybe they've heard, you know, they say that

215
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,400
Hucka dude, Hucka Hucka, Hucka thing. Of course referencing Hucka B. And that's purely because of

216
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,640
the Chuck Norris idea, which by the way was stellar. It really was. So anyway, so I think the Ron Paul

217
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,120
campaign is going to be stepping up. Thank you very much. Comics are blogger for that report.

218
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,720
I got one for you. I got an awesome song that'll sound even better on your brand new

219
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,880
Sony headphones. Check them out at Sony.com slash headphones. They've got wireless headphones.

220
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,480
They've got special noise reduction headphones. If you've got a pair, call in. Let me know how they're

221
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,360
working for you.

222
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:22,720
Yeah, Adam is so count on calling you again. Again, Mary Christmas and sent you some more twisted

223
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,280
Christmas tunes. I hope you enjoy them. If you do, please feel free to enjoy them with the

224
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,880
masses out there again. These tunes are from Bob Rivers. I think Rodney Carrington,

225
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,520
some stuff. I just found all over the web there. But they are twisted Christmas tunes. Dude,

226
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,480
enjoy. Hope to hear him soon. All right. Talk to you later. All right. All right.

227
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,640
So Cal Tom, everybody. Send them in a nice folder of Christmas tunes.

228
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:01,520
I'll be sharing with you up until next Tuesday, I guess. 25th. You're like this one. Me and Mrs.

229
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:31,280
It's not in. But when Santa's gone, we'll lose to the north corner.

230
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:46,560
We meet every Christmas Eve as Chris Kringleaves, 630. The reindeer teams at the end.

231
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Sex it twice, making all kinds of noise. Not a jack in the box displays.

232
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:27,280
We've got a thing going on. We've got to be extra careful. We've got those doors to build.

233
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:42,400
And I'm just on Santa's birthday, I want to sneak on and unwrap you behind the old man's

234
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,760
day. I'm going to send that one to Patricia. You know, Billy Paul, Mrs. Jones,

235
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,960
me and Mrs. Jones, one of our favorite songs.

236
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,120
Oh, this just came over the wire. This kind of sucks. Dan Fulgoberg, singer and songwriter

237
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,200
who's hits leader of the band and same old, same old langsign, helped define the soft rock

238
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,520
era died Sunday at his home in Maine after battling prostate cancer. He was 56. Oh, man, that is too young.

239
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,680
His death was announced Sunday on the singer's website. Dan left us this morning at 6am.

240
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,840
He fought a brave battle with cancer and died peacefully at home in Maine with his wife,

241
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,240
Jean at his side. It read, his strength dignity and grace in the face of the daunting

242
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:41,680
challenges of this disease when inspiration to all who knew him. Oh, man. Sorry to hear that.

243
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Let's play some of Dan Fulgoberg. Interestingly enough, neither of the two songs that

244
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,840
were mentioned in this article. You probably recognize this one, though.

245
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:36,400
I've been in love with you. Stronger than any mountain could be. True than any tree ever

246
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:56,640
grew. Deeper than any forest right here. I love with you. I'll read, I'll read in the winter.

247
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:12,000
You said showers in the springs. We'll fly through the marvels of us with love on the rain.

248
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:26,240
Through the years as the fire starts to glow. Burning lines in the book of my life,

249
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:35,840
through the vine grows. And the pages start to glow. I'll read love with you.

250
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:45,680
I'll be in love with you.

251
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:21,840
Longer than every day she's in the ocean. I'll read, I'll read, I'll read, I'll read, I'll read,

252
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:38,240
I'll read, I'll read, I'll read, I'll read, I'll read, I'll read, I'll read, I'll read, I'll read,pre deinen

253
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:47,600
in peace, Dan Fogelberg, longer than one-one-six-point-seven-of-a-film-light-of-a-film-of-a-bully.

254
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,120
Great songs that I've made for sure.

255
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Hi, Adam.

256
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,000
Allison Lee here from CrapCast.

257
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yes.

258
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I just want to say hello.

259
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,440
I've been thinking about you, miss you, I've been listening.

260
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,320
First I want to thank you for being on your pod finder episode number 31, talking about

261
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
CrapCast.

262
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
Yeah.

263
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Big hug to you.

264
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Thank you.

265
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,640
And second, okay, here's a small world story.

266
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,720
So I'm listening to this past Thursday show, and you start talking about your

267
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,280
flying experience coming out of Newark and being held on the tarmac.

268
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Well, guess what?

269
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
What?

270
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,560
I was being held on the tarmac on the plane right next to you.

271
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,960
I was sitting on the continental flight and our pilot came on and was trying to make

272
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
us feel better.

273
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,240
And in so doing so said, see, the plane next to us right there, they've been sitting

274
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,560
on the tarmac as well, but they don't have any electricity.

275
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Just right.

276
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:50,680
Oh, so close yet so far, but then it gets better, and you should have been on my plane.

277
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Cause guess what happened now.

278
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
You all got naked?

279
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,120
So, we're sitting there in after five hours.

280
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Yes.

281
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,120
To Ruth comes on and says, due to people calling from their cell phones to the continental

282
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:09,000
airlines, as well as somebody having someone's private number, we are now going back

283
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,840
to the gate to let these people off.

284
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
Oh boy.

285
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Please ring their bell.

286
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
She had right.

287
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,480
Head count to figure out the number of people we need to arrange this for.

288
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,240
Oh, busted.

289
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,680
It wasn't me, but I rang my bell anyway because at that point, hello, five and a half

290
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,120
hours sitting on the tarmac with a plane going nowhere.

291
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
I know shit.

292
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,600
I have Gordon Bethume's number, his office number at least probably wouldn't have helped

293
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,680
on a Friday evening, but I probably would have called it after five hours.

294
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,600
Well, the bells went off like crazy, and then people started screaming about getting upset

295
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,560
that we'd lose our place in line and the D.I. seeing.

296
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Oh, yeah.

297
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,880
Then all of a sudden, everyone's at fucking aviation expert, right?

298
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,920
I'm on story short at six hours later, we were back at the gate.

299
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,120
Leaving the plane saying bye-bye to going to Florida for a few days, but so be it.

300
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,520
I was very happy that point to get off and get home.

301
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,040
So, but if I had only known, we could have been texting each other back in the

302
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
way through the window.

303
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Oh, yeah.

304
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Oh, yeah.

305
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Oh, small world.

306
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
That's small world.

307
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
So.

308
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Say it.

309
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
Have a great holiday.

310
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Say it.

311
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Love your show.

312
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Say it.

313
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
The big hug.

314
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
Love you.

315
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Yeah.

316
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
Yeah.

317
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
We could have had some nasty back and forth texting, baby.

318
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,560
Now the Twitter is broken on T-Mobile.

319
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
We could have done it directly.

320
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Hey, Adam and he's stuck in San Diego.

321
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,240
Hey, you are looking forward to a great show about Shalom.

322
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,360
I've just been spending the last week catching up on the last two weeks of DSCs, so I'm

323
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,360
one behind.

324
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,680
I've just listened to most of 69 and I finally have to make a couple of comments.

325
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:51,280
First about the no shopping thing, very briefly, just over last couple of years of gas

326
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,520
prices have gotten high emails and calls for boycotts.

327
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,200
And they've got some gone around either.

328
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,200
All right.

329
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
Let me just interview for a second.

330
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
You've talked.

331
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,680
So this is about the wrong brand and about getting people to consume less to show the strength

332
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,880
of us consumers.

333
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,640
So it's not about stopping shopping entirely.

334
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,680
It's maybe about choosing what you shop and showing the strength of what the mighty consumers

335
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,240
of the United States of America can actually do.

336
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,280
Not entirely an organized program just yet.

337
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,960
So you know, not like I'm calling out yet, I'm just trying to figure out if anyone comes

338
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,800
up with a great idea, because clearly I'm stuck as how we can propagate this, then I'll

339
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,640
be happy to get behind it.

340
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,800
But anyway, so you're equating this to, I think what you're about to say here, you've

341
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,560
talked is that people just don't give a shit.

342
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,960
Is that what you're trying to say that when we all were saying, hey, don't buy gas,

343
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,600
people just were filling up their hummers.

344
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Is that what you're saying?

345
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,480
Total gas outs or boycotts of specific gas stations and unfortunately, that sort of thing

346
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,360
just really tends to not work because people make up and offset what they're not buying

347
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,760
on that one day that they don't shop with shopping on other days.

348
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,120
So it would work that way for gas and I think, you know, I love to not go to a mall

349
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,240
or not go shopping for a day, but you know, I know that most people would probably offset

350
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,360
that by going shopping another day.

351
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,000
Let me just say one thing about the oil look in person.

352
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,920
First of all, you can't expect and we're so used to quick fix immediate result culture.

353
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,520
This kind of stuff is just not going to happen.

354
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,440
It's just not going to be, oh, look, look at what we did, you know, I don't think you can

355
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,760
quite do a Ron Paul money bomb on people not buying gasoline.

356
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,560
However, if you look at just what the markets are doing, the free markets, the consumers

357
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,920
have already really made a very clear choice.

358
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,440
So do you think that car companies would be making hybrid and electric cars out of their

359
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
own accord?

360
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,040
No, of course they wouldn't have.

361
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,440
They're doing it because consumers want to people want an electric car.

362
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
They want to hybrid.

363
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,600
So now everyone's jumping on board and making them.

364
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,040
You know, I think that's a real testament.

365
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,520
And whereas in the past, we know there is tons of evidence.

366
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
What was that car?

367
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,320
The EV, I think, electric vehicle that you actually couldn't buy but was given to celebrities

368
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,920
to try out and they took them away.

369
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,160
And there's a whole video out there, probably get it on video.google.com, the death of the

370
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
electric car.

371
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
I think is what it's called.

372
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
Let me Google that.

373
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Well, we're talking.

374
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,160
Well, second, I'll do it right now.

375
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,920
The death, it wasn't the death of the electric car, we'll learn.

376
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,520
So you know, they clearly wanted to stifle that and now look at whatever everyone's doing.

377
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,640
The death of the electric car.

378
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,480
Google with me, everybody, here we go.

379
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Let's see.

380
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,280
Yeah, the death of the electric car.

381
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,800
Three minutes, two minutes, oh gosh, I hope there's a, looks like lots of trailers.

382
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,080
Maybe it's not available in full.

383
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Where did I see it?

384
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,080
I probably saw it on the plane.

385
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,080
Virgin probably had it.

386
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,920
It's like a documentary.

387
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,080
Hunt around if you find a link.

388
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
Oh, yeah.

389
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
Oh, no.

390
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
If you find a link send a to me.

391
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,320
I'll add it to the show notes post show.

392
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,520
So that is working.

393
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,680
There is something happening there.

394
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,920
I think that has to be a sustained effort of a longer period of time.

395
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
Oh, there we go.

396
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
It makes a difference.

397
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Yes.

398
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:20,560
And then as far as your travel woes, man, oh my god, dido to scull fucking the rotting

399
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,560
quirks of the PSA and Homeland Security.

400
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:29,240
You are being abused and reemed every single time you travel as these last few times.

401
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,800
It is horrendous, horrifying, terrorizing to hear.

402
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,560
Well, let me just make a clear that I don't think that the people at Homeland Security

403
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,480
are harassing me or abusing me, they're doing their job.

404
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,920
And they're doing it to the best of their ability.

405
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,840
I presume they're just trying to figure out if I pose any kind of threat based upon some

406
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,600
vague warning that is not telling them anything other than check this guy.

407
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,680
So now they're doing their job.

408
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,400
Nothing against that.

409
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,520
By the way, I have a very different feeling about the TSA security screeners who are

410
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:11,080
at the airport, who are the same people who use to pretend to be screeners back in the

411
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,280
90s when I was traveling a lot.

412
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,720
Throughout the 90s, I was always harping on those guys, like they're really the idiots.

413
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,880
They really are.

414
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:26,120
And you can hold me up as long as you want, you know, undress me all, feel me up.

415
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
I don't care.

416
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
I have nothing to hide from you.

417
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:35,720
But the system of being going through secondary screening and not being able to get off that

418
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,200
list or be cleared as it were.

419
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,440
Well, that's actually interesting.

420
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,280
I wonder if, you know, next time I'm next time I'm at the airport, I'm going to ask those

421
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,360
people who are the, who those people, it's Homeland Security who are selling the clear program.

422
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,240
Say, if I get this ID card and give you my fingerprints and you give me a retinal scan,

423
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,480
will that allow me access into the country?

424
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,600
Without being harassed, I'll ask that.

425
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,200
Let's see what they say to that, okay?

426
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,560
And I had to tell you as, and Israeli citizen, you know, I'm Israeli and, you know,

427
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:14,600
traveled enough, both into and outside of Israel and around the rest of the world to know what

428
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,360
real, airline and transportation security is.

429
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,600
These Israelis kind of have it down.

430
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,120
And what the TSA is doing, my friend, is not security.

431
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,960
It is theater of the absurd.

432
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,000
It is ridiculous.

433
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,840
So I can always ask them, but as I definitely hope, you can follow up with the Freedom of Information

434
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,560
Act request and maybe get some information about what they're doing to you because that is just

435
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,200
a piece.

436
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:45,320
So, stop putting in my two shackles and I'm just catching up in Hebrew.

437
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:51,320
What we used to, what you used to want us to say is, left these day in, at a hurry, go

438
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,000
fuck yourself and then, you know, or fuck you.

439
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,080
And then, of course, the recent thing is, I need to have a car at him.

440
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,680
I love you, Adam Curry.

441
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
Ah, left me clear.

442
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,360
I have a great weekend.

443
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,240
All right, you have to.

444
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,200
Thanks for checking in, man.

445
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,280
Oh, yeah, by the way, I totally agree.

446
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,120
Give me some Israeli security and then I'll buy it.

447
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,800
And I'm pretty sure that they can take you off of their list if they know that you're

448
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,880
clean or clear or whatever you want to call it.

449
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,560
All right, let's do one more.

450
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,960
Interesting, this came in today, not meant for a football Friday, but a manic Monday.

451
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:56,680
No, how's it going, Adam?

452
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,840
It's Jersey Todd, the official musical, just of the Chacha.

453
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:06,040
Yeah, yeah, I know, it's not my day, but I had to talk it today because I got something

454
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,520
for you that's just absolutely bizarre.

455
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,440
There's a band up on the Ponte music network that they're incredible,

456
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,680
called the mob stories at a Belgium.

457
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,720
They put up a new track in the last couple of weeks.

458
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,360
And I've been listening to it a lot and I love it.

459
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:26,360
There's something incredibly catchy about this track, but also at the same time this band is

460
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,560
incredibly unique.

461
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,640
They, I've never heard of a band like this.

462
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,040
They actually have two female lead singers.

463
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,280
We've played them before on Fubar Friday, but this track that they posted, it's like,

464
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,120
nothing I've ever heard before.

465
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,640
I mean, I love it.

466
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,920
It's incredibly catchy.

467
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,120
There's a beat to it.

468
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,280
They are overwhelmingly enthusiastic and seeing the song.

469
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,560
The problem is I have no fucking idea what they're talking about.

470
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,320
Check this out, and maybe you can help me out with this.

471
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,760
It's the mob stories with big dick, but it's not a, I have no idea what they're

472
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,040
fucking talking about, check this out.

473
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,200
Sound is about to happen.

474
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,080
There's got to be no longer rule on the track.

475
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,080
Everybody's watching.

476
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,480
You don't know what to do.

477
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,760
Yeah, it's taking some beefy videos.

478
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

479
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,360
It's taking some beefy videos, yeah, yeah, yeah.

480
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:28,600
It's taking some beefy videos, yeah, yeah, yeah.

481
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
It's taking some beefy videos, yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
It's taking some beefy videos, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,400
It's taking some beefy videos, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,080
It's taking some beefy videos, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

485
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:50,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

486
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,640
You are living me.

487
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,720
I hide, I'm not like you, you can hardly make this,

488
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,680
I, you hate right for me, you'll never want me down me.

489
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,840
I hide just not done like you,

490
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,480
you can hardly make this, I, you hate right for me.

491
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,640
You'll never want me down me.

492
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,640
Whoa, I got this feeling.

493
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
If I'm just bad to help us

494
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,640
There's just been a lack of hope

495
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,640
Much every sight

496
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Everybody's watching

497
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
You don't know where to go

498
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
Gotta speak

499
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,640
Don't be beaten in sight

500
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah

501
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640

You ain't right for me

You'll never walk me down
