00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,760
Of course, the problem is that I was unplugged the whole week.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,840

It's just about the hottest download on limewire these days.

43
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Not only is it not hot safe, it's not even remotely.

44
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:42,480
It's also on YouTube, playing the straight from YouTube.com, it is the Beatles vs. 9-inch nails,

45
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,560
come closer together, it's got a fantastic slide show to go in it.

46
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,200
I just couldn't resist had the play at 4-0.

47
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,800
Debbie's Toursco at episode number 635, how you doing come to view from Swanky's

48
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,720
on the west side of G-town from the Curry Manner it is your....

49
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,120
Wow.

50
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,840
It's odd, to get together.

51
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,760
Dude, it's Monday.

52
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,260
And I'm a little bit fuzzy still I have to say.

53
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,360
What a weekend.

54
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
My goodness.

55
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,500
It was a Guilfest against given here in Gilford and unfortunately I didn't

56
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
get to go.

57
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,120
I had some other commitments.

58
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,000
called me last night though around around nine thirty from Gilfest and she said

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,240
Da da da da da da da. She holds up the phone. She's like, listen, it's madness. It's your boys.

60
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,200
Your boys are on stage. One step beyond.

61
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,200
So cool man. We bridging bridging a couple generations there. Patricia and I went to a

62
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,840
garden party yesterday, which was the weather. I mean, it was nice because the weather

63
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,080
did stay dry at the garden party. But this weather, well, I'll talk about the weather in a second.

64
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:02,760
It was the annual Ben and Halane for vine garden party. Ben for vine is the the CEO.

65
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,480
Do you see? Yeah. Yeah. CEO of British telecom. He's a Dutch guy before this. I think it was

66
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:14,440
at Lusant in the States. He's been at ITT KPN. I mean, he's one of the CEO guys that

67
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,960
definitely travels around from company to company. Of course, quite celebrated at the moment.

68
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,200
Because British telecom is doing incredibly well. And it was, you know, we had no idea what to

69
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,360
expect. It was just a little bit south of us in Hazelmeer. So a nice drive for the country side

70
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,640
only about 30 minutes. And had no idea, you know, I just like, you know, the the invitation garden

71
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,880
party. It's their garden party. So, you know, we were very curious. Well, it turns out,

72
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:49,720
it was us and 1199 other people who had been invited. I said, I kid you not 1200 people

73
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,800
at a garden party. And you know, and I did some work, you know, I'd look at the invitation.

74
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,240
And like, oh, if you take the train, they've got shuttle buses running from the train in a

75
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,640
station. I thought that's kind of cool. I thought that I could just drive right up to the house and,

76
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,200
you know, I found the postcode and arrived and they said, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,

77
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,680
you have to go back to the station. There's no place to park. And that's before, of course,

78
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,960
I knew there were 1200 people who had been invited. So back to the station, hopped on the shuttle

79
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,680
van. And it was, it was unbelievable, this party. It was, it was more like a British telecom

80
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,440
partners, customers, type party. There were just, I didn't know a single person there because it was

81
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,120
mainly, I think BT salespeople. But there were a whole bunch of Dutch people. Of course, I guess

82
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,920
then and Helen have a lot of acquaintances in the Netherlands. And because of that, they had

83
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:45,960
brought in Dutch catering, who catered the entire Chebang, which was great because they had something

84
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,200
completely, typically Dutch, which no one was touching. None of the, none of the British were

85
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,600
touching it. It's a raw herring, herring with onions. And this is a, you know, it is a special way

86
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:03,000
of eating it. Actually, it's not entirely raw. It's been put in salt, I guess. So it is kind of cooked.

87
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,320
And you kind of slobber through the onions. And then you hold it, you hold it above your head

88
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,160
by the tail. And you just kind of suck the herring right off. And that sounded wrong, didn't it?

89
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,440
And this is a delicacy in the Netherlands. It did really only good once a year when you have the

90
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,920
fresh new herring. So Patricia and I hung out at the herring bar for quite a while. But they have a

91
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,720
good time. You know, talk to a bunch of different people. They had, you know, like celebrity tennis

92
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,200
match going on with, um, I don't know many of these names, but I recognize the name Pat Cash.

93
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,600
They had like all these, you know, ex-wimbledon winners who were playing, it was, it was, it was very

94
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:46,440
much like a, like a dot-com party, you know, from, from the, from the late 90s. It was quite spectacular.

95
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,000
So we had a good time. We had, uh, some good food and, uh, chatter with a couple of folks.

96
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,880
And, uh, then, uh, just came back to chill out. Now the weather, I had been looking at the weather

97
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,040
all day. Um, actually all weekend. Now, I'm looking at aviation weather. So I could pretty much

98
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,520
predict it was going to stay completely dry in that part of the country. And I was right.

99
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,800
Other parts of the country. It's been horrendous. And you have to know, uh, do you remember El NiÃ±o

100
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,080
remember, uh, when the El NiÃ±o winds were, we're flowing across the, the globe? Well, there's something

101
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,200
now called La NiniÃ±a. I think it's La Nini, El NiÃ±o was what we had. And now it's La NiniÃ±a,

102
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:27,560
like the ninja. And that's basically just swirling off the southwest, uh, to the southwest of,

103
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,200
of the UK of the islands. And it's just shooting all this crap up. You know, if, if you've been

104
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,640
following the news, you'll know that, uh, it's been, uh, it's just been horrific in, uh, in England,

105
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,080
Wales and, uh, and, and the northern parts of the country, they've had flooding. It's just been,

106
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,240
it's been bad. And I'm afraid that it's not going to get much better. Uh, we just may have a really

107
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,720
shitty summer as compared to, uh, the summer that we were, uh, we were promised. Well,

108
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,720
so much for global warming. I thought we're going to have beach front here in the UK crap.

109
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:05,400
More controversy about the BBC, uh, I think I told John Friday, the BBC, uh, were slapped

110
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,480
down for editing a, uh, a fly, what they call a fly on the wall documentary about the Queen,

111
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,920
uh, Annie Lebowitz was a photograph in the Queen Acid or take her tiara off the Queen protested,

112
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,360
cut to the Queen walking away angrily. Unfortunately, that was actually a shot of the Queen walking

113
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,640
in. I don't even think the sound is synced up. I don't know if anyone's looked. I don't think

114
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,040
you even hear the Queen, you, you hear her talking, but you don't even hear lips move. It was so

115
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,880
freaking fake. Now, there's a whole nother flap about, uh, something, was it news night, I think,

116
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,440
is it news night? I, well, anyway, another BBC news program, uh, that they edited this piece

117
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,200
about Gordon Brown, how he's trying to avoid, uh, certain members of the press and, and what they

118
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,080
did is they took footage, uh, over a course of three or four weeks and it made it look like this

119
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,120
was all happening in the course of a day or two. And so, you know, now there's these big investigations

120
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:04,680
going on. The BBC can't believe that, you know, all this must be, uh, just a, you know, it's just

121
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,560
an isolated one or two isolated events or incidents. And I'm thinking, dude, I've been in

122
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,000
television all my life. This is, this is what we do. It's how you make television exciting is you

123
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,880
edit stuff around. And of course, you completely distort the truth. I posted the, the XNTV

124
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,800
experiment to curry.com. I'd forgotten to put that in the show notes on Friday. So I'll try and

125
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,080
remember to put it in the show notes for today. Michael Hall sent me an email about it. Yeah,

126
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,560
Adam, the BBC lied with the allegation about the Queen, you're right. But this is the challenge

127
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,800
that the blogging and podcasting community has not taken up. The BBC corrected itself

128
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,320
when has a non-genitalistic blog or podcast ever corrected itself. You have on handful of occasions,

129
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,000
but most of them were grudging, grudging at best. When my paper makes a mistake, I guess Michael

130
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,040
works for a, for a newspaper in Canada. We published a correction period and we tried to learn

131
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,840
from a mistake because it's our livelihood. Look, uh, you're, you're misunderstanding what's going on

132
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:04,520
blogging and podcasting audio and text. It's not the same thing. This is manipulating images.

133
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,240
Every single time you see an edit, a zoom or some kind of technical event on television,

134
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,560
in essence, your brain has to fill in the rest of the formula. So, uh, it movies too. You know,

135
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,440
if, if you're looking at a scene inside, cut to outside, your brain fills in the entire piece

136
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,280
about someone walking out the door, opening the door, getting their key. You know, it's, uh, it's

137
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,760
a very different animal. And if this is a surprise to anyone that this goes on in television,

138
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,280
every single day, I would say almost every single program. You know, and, and now people are

139
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,120
getting fined, left and right, $50,000 to a kids program, blue, Peter, because they had some

140
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,880
kid from the audience pretend to be a prize winner. I mean, this happens all the time. You know,

141
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:57,240
if, if, if, if this actually, I think is the unraveling of of television, it'll, it'll probably,

142
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,560
it may go a little bit further. I think here in the UK, because the BBC is under tremendous

143
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:08,520
scrutiny, the whole point of the BBC and the license fees, because we pay like Â£150 a year,

144
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,360
which goes straight to the BBC, they apparently should not have the pressures to sex stuff up

145
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,120
that the commercial television networks have, because, you know, they don't have to sell to advertisers.

146
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:27,480
Of course, it's not true. Every single person looks at ratings. And the job security is based

147
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,360
upon ratings, even within the BBC, all public broadcasters have this. So it's a, it's a, it's a

148
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,040
fallacy to think that, uh, that just because they're nonprofit or not for profit or sponsored

149
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,040
by the people that they don't go through the same motions of sexing shit up, you know, to make it,

150
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,520
to make it attractive, to make people want to watch if this is, this literally is the big,

151
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,760
blue, blue pill stuff that I've been talking about. That is the spectacle. And if you've ever

152
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,360
been in a situation where you were at some place or at some event, or you were the subject

153
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,240
of something that was later televised, you'll immediately understand how much trickery,

154
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,200
fakeery, and sexing up takes place all the time. This is, uh, it's going to be quite a revelation

155
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:19,160
for people as more of more of these stories, uh, come out. Uh, let's see what, uh, this all kinds of

156
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,120
interesting email that I got. No, that's something I'll do that in a second. Um, big news, uh, on Sunday

157
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,040
as well, a couple things. First of all, a very own Dr. Cockney is now, uh, being featured every Sunday

158
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,520
in, uh, the news of the world, which is a huge newspaper. Uh, only comes out on Sundays. It's, uh,

159
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,440
of course, uh, let me just, let me just, say, put it this way. We only buy the news of the world on

160
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,440
Sunday for the sports, of course, not for the other content that would be in being there.

161
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,840
But nine million, million people read this. And so now the doc is, uh, is doing his great

162
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,080
British sex survey for the news of the world. It's on their side. And, uh, it's, uh, given

163
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,800
him a lot of exposure, it's very excited about it. But there was another, uh, newspaper that came

164
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,280
out on Sunday with something very interesting in it. Hey Adam, Dave, we can't just go here.

165
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,520
Question for you. I just heard that British giving away three million copies of a new album

166
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:16,200
planet Earth. And I think it's a UK I believe. And I'm curious what your thoughts on that are.

167
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,560
These, uh, record label is, uh, live it, as they said, and won't even release the album there

168
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,360
because what? That's a couple of findings, giving away a couple of findings in this day and age with

169
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:34,040
digital music rights and such. Love to hear your comment. Blue pill. Okay. Well, they're still

170
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,880
hope for you, my friend. Yeah, very interesting. Prince released his planet Earth CD through the

171
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:47,160
Daily Mail. Uh, it was packaged in the newspaper itself. And this is a, uh, it's very, it's a new model.

172
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,480
It's a new distribution model. Of course, Prince, as far as I know, uh, owns all of his, um, music

173
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,880
and the publishing rights. So, um, uh, he is, quote, record company are really only there for distribution

174
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,080
through their channels, through stores. And I presume, through things like iTunes, although I don't see

175
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,640
why Prince wouldn't, you know, go bypass the record company and go straight to iTunes for that as well.

176
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:16,120
Which he probably will. Um, so, you know, it's really inexpensive to do this type of distribution.

177
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:22,440
It only really costs about, um, I think Percy D. And it's, and it's, you know, that's not like you

178
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:29,160
get a nice jewel box or anything. I mean, it's just a cardboard, um, you know, like a fold of piece of

179
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,200
cardboard is the sleeve. No liner notes, no nothing, uh, not even a track listing. The track listing

180
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,120
is on the CD itself. It only costs like, you know, 40, 50 cents to actually, you know, work one of

181
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,720
those up and, and then there's some costs for the newspaper to inserting it. So they made a deal.

182
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,520
Real simple, you know, did he sell, did he sell each copy for, uh, for 10 bucks? No, he sold each

183
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,400
copy maybe for like a buck or, uh, maybe a little bit less. And for the news of the world,

184
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,560
uh, excuse me, for the Daily Mail, that just goes straight out of their marketing and advertising

185
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,120
budget because they do have three or four million readers. And they do this all the time. They do, uh,

186
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:11,080
DVDs of, uh, of classic, um, series like the World at War and stuff. So yeah, so Prince probably

187
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:16,200
made, uh, I would, I would think that he, he might have pocketed about a million dollars, uh, for

188
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,400
those three million that went out. And, you know, really, it's, you know, if you read the interviews

189
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,040
that he's putting out there, it's, for him, it's just getting the music out. Oh, I wish he would

190
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,720
put some of that stuff pod safe. All right. If I, you know, I've met the guy once, really nice guy. He's

191
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,360
not as small as you think he is, by the way, maybe I'm just used to Patricia, but really down to Earth

192
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:45,000
guy. That's not a hype joke. Um, you know, a nice and very informed and, uh, and not wacky at all.

193
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,040
And, uh, and he doesn't talk with that soft voice, uh, when you just talk into him normally,

194
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,400
that you probably think he uses all the time. Uh, so if we get about all that, listen to the CD,

195
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,040
not bad. I love the, uh, the track, uh, which has been getting a lot of play here. I love my guitar.

196
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,800
Um, there's some really nice jazz stuff on it. There's one track that sounds a little bit like, uh,

197
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:14,760
the controversy, uh, or controversy, um, uh, baseline, uh, some good stuff on it. Uh, I like it.

198
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,920
Of course, I'm a huge Prince fan. And I'll, man, I would do any, I would give my left, not just to

199
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,160
get that on the podcast music network. But this, of course, is the new forms of distribution

200
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,520
that we're going to see. Prince, um, you know, has a very, you know, he's, he's got a strong base to do

201
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,120
this. Um, but there's no difference to me, you know, for him going around the entire music industry,

202
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:40,040
uh, working with the Daily Mail, or someone going through Starbucks, or indeed working, uh,

203
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,240
with all of the, uh, thousand, tens of thousands of producers and podcasts, there's an independent, uh,

204
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,960
uh, radio and video, uh, programmers, uh, on the internet through, um, sites like the podcast

205
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,400
music network, where everything is just kind of taken care of with one mouse click and all the

206
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,480
rights are arranged. And it's working. So I applaud Prince now to get the guy on the podcast music network.

207
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,800
And lots of people are thinking about this. I told you, I'm working on, uh, red bullet in the

208
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:12,040
Netherlands, getting, uh, golden earring, focus, shocking blue. Um, I haven't seen their entire

209
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,200
catalog. More people are thinking about putting their catalog online. I'm really loving this shit.

210
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,560
Hey Adam, this is Chris Suspect from Washington, DC. I just got finished listening to, uh,

211
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:28,360
episode number six, 33 of the DSC, and which we're talking about, uh, the internet, uh,

212
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,000
radio streaming radio going dark. Uh, I think this is going to be actually a real big

213
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,120
balloon for a pot show and, uh, podcast music. Um, but what I wanted to say is, uh,

214
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,560
uh, it would I completely agree with what you have to say about, um, you know, the big labels

215
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:51,560
and the music. There's lots of other choices out there. And I think it's time to make other artists

216
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:57,160
aware. I used to want to label many, many meetings to go, uh, punk rock label at DC called

217
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,200
tourcrack records. And while we all have those to the couple tracks up there, some bands that

218
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:09,240
I have been in, I think I'm just going to post the entire catalog and that's 20 CDs. Um,

219
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,520
and, uh, some of those tracks on their future folks like David Grohl, uh, Brian Baker from

220
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:21,400
Old Miner Threat Currently with Bad Religion, uh, lots of good punk rock stuff. Um, and, uh,

221
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm all of it's available through, uh, through music. So, uh, it's great the one time I

222
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,520
put some stuff up there for a band I was in called VPR. Um, we actually, uh,

223
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,160
let's end like three weeks. We sold like 120 dollars worth of merchandise just through, uh,

224
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:42,520
through podcasts. And I really appreciate what you're doing, what you're doing for music. And I think

225
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:49,320
you're, uh, writing the wave into the future. So, um, I'd appreciate it if you could play a VPR track

226
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,880
on the DSC, uh, particularly the one most people like is my girl turned into a lesbian. And I think

227
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,760
you'll find the lyrics funny. A little harder than what you normally play, but I play bass and

228
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,040
and I think half the song. So, you can hear that I sound like, uh, I'm not that great of a singer,

229
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:12,360
but the song is good. So, check it out and I appreciate it. So, thanks again for all you're doing,

230
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,760
and have a great day. No, do, do, do, do. Thank you so much. It's much appreciated. And even though

231
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,960
you're right, it's not exactly the type of song I'd play on the Charlie, I just got to play

232
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,320
it for you, uh, particularly the, uh, the title of the song, intrigue me. And remember,

233
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:40,840
there's a fast forward button for a reason. This is a true story.

234
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:03,800
I'm not getting it, I'm not getting it, I'm not getting it, I'm not getting it, I'm not getting it,

235
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,720
this is a phobic shit. Well, it could be, live a clean unfinished fight,

236
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,600
my go, otherwise go, I just can't deal with that.

237
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,280
My go watches minister on around, not getting it, not getting it, I'm not getting it, don't worry about

238
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
I'm gonna punch you all the time

239
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,280
I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie

240
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
We don't wear a dress, she says she's got a dress

241
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
She said my answer's too fat

242
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
My girl, she said she likes girls

243
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,280
I just can't deal with that

244
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,280
My girl, I can't deal with that

245
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie

246
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
She says she got a dress, I'm not gonna lie

247
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,280
I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie

248
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
I'm not gonna lie

249
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,280
I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie

250
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,280
I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie

251
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
I'm not gonna lie

252
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
That hurt so good

253
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,280
VPR, my girl turned into a lesbian

254
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
You can find that on the Potsay Music Network

255
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Of course, links to that in the show notes at DailySourceCode.com

256
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Steven Palsmackers sent me pretty funny

257
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,280
I don't know we got this from

258
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,280
You know we have the in the United States

259
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
We have the concept of the terror threat level

260
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,280
Which I think is right now pretty much

261
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Lodged at threat level orange

262
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
And the Europeans apparently have also

263
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,280
instilled their own threat level

264
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Warning system against terrorism

265
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,280
As you know, the chief of homeland security

266
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,280
In the United States says he has a gut feeling

267
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
That we're in for it

268
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,280
That there's another big attack coming

269
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,280
That of course probably pertains to the US

270
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,280
But well, we have some upgrades here in Europe as well

271
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,280
The British are feeling the pension relation

272
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,280
To recent terrorist threats and of raise their security level

273
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
From MIFT to Pieved

274
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,280
Soon whoever security levels may have to be raised to

275
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Irritated or even a bit cross

276
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Londoners have not been a bit cross

277
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,280
Since the blitz in 1940 when T supplies all but ran out

278
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
Terrorists have also been recannigarized

279
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,280
From tiresome to a bloody nuisance

280
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Last time the British used a bloody nuisance

281
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,280
Warning level was during the Great Fire of London

282
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
Of 1666

283
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,280
Now the French government also announced yesterday

284
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
That it had raised its terror alert level

285
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
From run to hide

286
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,280
The only two levels higher in France are

287
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
Surrender and collaborate

288
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,280
This latest rise was precipitated by a fire

289
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
That destroyed France's white flag factory

290
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,280
Effectively paralyzing the country's military capability

291
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
In addition to the British and the French

292
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,280
Italy has increased its alert level

293
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,280
From shout loudly and excitedly

294
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,280
To elaborate military posturing

295
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Two more levels remain which of course

296
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,280
Are ineffective combat operations and change sides

297
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,280
Belgians on the other hand

298
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Are all on holiday and the only threat they are worried about

299
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
This NATO pulling out of Brussels

300
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Finally the Spanish are very excited

301
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Their new submarines are ready to deploy

302
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,280
These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms

303
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,280
So the new Spanish Navy can get a really good look at

304
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,280
The old Spanish Navy

305
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,280
One, two, one, six, two, five

306
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,280
Six, three, five, seven

307
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,280
One, two, one, six, two, five

308
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Six, three, five, seven

309
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Out of the synopsis of ont

310
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,280
Hey, I'm just having this random thought

311
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
You know, especially for us American guys

312
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,280
There is nothing better in the world than a cute British check

313
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,280
With an American, with a British accent

314
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,280
And I'm wondering, is it possible

315
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,280
That you guys could do something like

316
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
I don't know, is there a podcast out there

317
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,280
With someone like a Callie Lewis

318
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Or a Carmen Tyler

319
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Or somebody who's going to do it

320
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
A frequent show

321
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,280
And you see what I'm getting at here

322
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,280
And it's just going to do sort of a free form podcast

323
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,280
Because all I want to do is sit and listen

324
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
I don't even hear what she talks about although

325
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
You know, that could be interesting too

326
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
But God, I don't know what maybe you think of it

327
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,280
But I could just, you might have a real, real winner

328
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,280
There, I mean, just, you know, we've already got an accent

329
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
But you add a nice British accent

330
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
That's not that whole thing, man

331
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,280
You know, you might very well have, uh, who would it be

332
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
About 150 men?

333
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Building an American guy is going

334
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,280
Us police, uh, just a thought

335
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
Man, well listen, I have the solution for you

336
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Be horned dog

337
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
And I do know what you mean

338
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,280
I could listen to many British women

339
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,280
I could just listen to them read the phone book

340
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,280
Uh, let me see, I have some examples here for you

341
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Well, we have, if you go to btpodshow.com

342
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280

Um, you'll, right on the homepage

You'll find a number of cool links

347
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
The one I would suggest right off the bat

348
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Which will probably lead you to other cool shows

349
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280

So it's not just audio of my friend

You can look at her as well

353
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Hold on a second

354
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
I'll give you a little sample of it

355
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
I'm just pulling her up right now

356
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
Let's see, come on Joe

357
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Talk to me baby

358
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Hey, it's my, if I'm going to

359
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
He's all on the big

360
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
What the hell is that?

361
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Oh, that's a promo

362
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
It's found a podfinder and of course

363
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
Joe, she's got a great line of a show

364
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
Okay, so this is not the sexy voice

365
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
I want to get a listen to

366
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,280
Oh, that is, again

367
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
Come on, give me Joe

368
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
Oh, here she comes

369
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Oh, that's cool

370
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,280
We have a promo for games, we don't

371
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,280
Excellent, oh, let me do the code promotion while we're at it

00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
You can win an iPod

Or free songs on iTunes

374
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
Come on in

375
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,280
Josephine

376
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
Hi guys and girls, welcome to podfinder

377
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
Oh, my name's Joe Lauren

378
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,280
So once again, I've got five fabulous podcasts

379
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
So there's that, then we have

380
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,280
UK celebrity news, Kasha van Sant

381
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,280
Let me see if I can find her

382
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
She's right here

383
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Of course, there's the MNP show

384
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,280
You might want to listen to the MNP show

385
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Let me see what else we have

386
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,280
There's the

387
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,280
On this week's show, things are really

388
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,280
Housing up in the world's celebrity

389
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Temp is a friend, everyone

390
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
What I'm saying?

391
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
So there's plenty of stuff out there

392
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,280
My friend, just go to btponshow.com

393
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,280
And I, well, satisfaction guaranteed

394
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Hi, I'm a serial presenter

395
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
I'm from the ultimate podcast

396
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,280
I am listening to DSC 634

397
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,280
I'm about 43 minutes into it

398
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
And I get it

399
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
I understand your channel concept

400
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
I understand the biobill

401
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
And how

402
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Actually cool it is

403
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
And the gentleman, the

404
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
I'm assuming you can

405
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,280
That was that James, I think, James

406
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Who really got it on Friday

407
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
I'm assuming you're from UK, obviously

408
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,280
Or

409
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,280
Yeah, but

410
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,280
Regardless, where he's from he

411
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,280
gave me a pretty good idea

412
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,280
Of what the channel concept is

413
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
And I get it

414
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,280
I get it, I think it's really cool

415
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Actually

416
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,280
And he showed me the

417
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,280
You know, the ability to

418
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
The flying shows in poncho

419
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,280
And to add them to a

420
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
You know, a cold and cold channel

421
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
Or feed, whatever you want to call it

422
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
And then take that feed

423
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Put it in iTunes

424
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
And then drop it on my iPod

425
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,280
So I understand now

426
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
When exactly what's to do it

427
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,280
I still probably will

428
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Give it a listen to

429
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,280
You know, my shows a little differently

430
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
Because sometimes

431
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,280
I don't want them all in one feed

432
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,280
But I do understand the concept

433
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
And I think it's pretty awesome

434
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,280
And I want to kind of applaud you

435
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,280
That I really couldn't get my mind

436
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
Around it at first

437
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
But now

438
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
Well, you know what it is, Gary

439
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
By the way, Gary's got

440
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
Some super episode coming up

441
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,280
You want to check out the ultimate podcast

442
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,280
He's got some

443
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Some awesome, like, fighter dude on there

444
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
And all this ultimate fighting

445
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
Cage fighting is really

446
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
Becoming all the rage

447
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
So we're right on the cutting edge there

448
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
It's really as hard as explaining

449
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
What Tivo is

450
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Yet if you give someone a Tivo

451
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
You show them, you know,

452
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
Couple menus

453
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
They're totally into it

454
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
And you'd have to pride

455
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,280
From their dead fingers

456
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,280
To, you know, to take it away from them

457
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
So all of this, of course,

458
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Is leading up to our brand new channel

459
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Editor

460
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Which we've codenamed cheddar

461
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,280
For a reason

462
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
One

463
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Because I like cheese

464
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Two

465
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
Because if you say channel editor

466
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
Channel editor, cheddar, cheddar, cheddar

467
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
Cheddar, it sounds like cheddar

468
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,280
And I was hoping we're going to release that Friday

469
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
I did jump the gun a little bit

470
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
We weren't quite ready

471
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Apparently there's quite a bit to the

472
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
DB alterers and all kinds of stuff

473
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,280
That has to happen in order to make that work

474
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Perfectly

475
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
And again, it's really beta stuff

476
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
So it's not like this is a big

477
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Launcher exposure

478
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
It's really only for people

479
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
Listening to the daily source

480
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Cokes, I don't think many other people will

481
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
Find it

482
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,280
Because that is a part of a much larger plan

483
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
That we're implementing now

484
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Which, as you know, is

485
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
Turning our site upside down

486
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Since we built the fucker inside out

487
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,280
And I want to apologize for

488
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Saying that it was a, you know,

489
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
I didn't really give a shit

490
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
Because I didn't get it

491
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
No dude, not a problem

492
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
No need to apologize

493
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
What's the other

494
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,280
But now I do

495
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,280
And I think it's just another thing

496
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,280
That you guys are trying to be setting edge on

497
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
And I do appreciate it

498
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Though, you know, it might not be for me

499
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Messing so it might be

500
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,280
I just need to kind of get in there

501
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
And work on it a little more

502
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,280
So, you know, great, great job

503
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,280
I just want to say that I do understand now

504
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
And I like to think that the gentleman who

505
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Call in and explain it

506
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Because I get it now

507
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
So thanks

508
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
Call the publisher.com

509
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
Yeah

510
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
Red pill, I'm sure

511
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Yeah dude

512
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,280
So the current planning is to release it

513
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,280
On Wednesday, that'll be Wednesday

514
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
San Francisco time

515
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
So that probably won't mean that

516
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Unless you're planning on being online

517
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,280
Wednesday evening in Europe

518
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
Or even on the east coast of the US

519
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,280
You probably won't really see it until Thursday

520
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,280
And that's when we're really going to

521
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
Start hammering this stuff out

522
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
And start working on it

523
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Because I have no idea exactly how it's going to work

524
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,280
What kind of things we're going to find out

525
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,280
When we basically feed the tail

526
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
Into the head of the beast, you know,

527
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
The whole idea of getting someone's channel

528
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
And putting it into yours

529
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
But in essence

530
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,280
It's just building upon, okay

531
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
I want to get a show

532
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,280
I want to get an episode

533
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
Or a channel

534
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
And now I want to put it somewhere

535
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
And that's going to really be the big

536
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Oh well, factor is

537
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
How do I put this channel onto my iPod

538
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,280
How do I, you know, just grabbing RSS

539
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,280
So I can put this channel onto some other device

540
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
That understands that

541
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,280
I'm very excited about it

542
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
I really, you know, looking at the

543
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Architects that we've built

544
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,280
I think it's going to be an awesome

545
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
Really do

546
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
All right, let's see

547
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Three, two minutes

548
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Yeah, I've been doing some long shows

549
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,280
Recently, so I want to

550
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
I want to try and cut this one

551
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
A little bit short today

552
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Even though it's not all that short

553
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,280
I want to do it with a band

554
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
That I am just absolutely nuts about

555
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
They showed up in the top ten

556
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,280
For the month of pod play

557
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,280
From the pod sake music network

558
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,280
I was, let me just see if I can find

559
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
Real quick

560
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
The called natives of the new dawn

561
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,280
I used to play

562
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,280
It was going to be a good day

563
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Which is one of my favorite songs

564
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
By them

565
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
I think that's what it is

566
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
Hold on

567
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
Natives of the new dawn

568
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
Shoot

569
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
Did they take the, I don't know

570
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Anyway

571
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
They've got a new one out

572
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
It's called your boy

573
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
And it is completely

574
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
Natives of the new dawn

575
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Kick an ass

576
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,280
Just sit back

577
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Jam the buds

578
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Indy

579
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
And enjoy

580
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Natives of the new dawn

581
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
Kick an ass

582
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
Mama

583
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Papa look at me

584
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280

00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
Mama look at me

586
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280

I'm glad you had

597
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
Respect to the people who

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Has seen them birthed me

599
