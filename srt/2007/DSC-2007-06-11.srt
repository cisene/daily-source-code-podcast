00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Hey, this is Trucker Tom from TruckerTomPodcast.com, PodShow needs you to help us suck less.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,480
Just go to suckless.podshow.com for complete details.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,120
You're Adam, installing.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,360
You'll, for the DSC-617, I got to set the record straight.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,320
You was talking about the ending of the sopranos, well,

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,680
it seems that my nephew at water has stolen the ending to the sopranos.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,600
That's all worry about it. We're going to get it back. I got a baseball bat with his name on it.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,840
I got a bunch of the boys. We're going to hunt them down and get back the ending, but

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,320
yeah, I was like you. I didn't know what was going on. I was in the backyard trying to adjust the

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,160
satellite dish because I thought I had lost my satellite, but not water stole the ending of the

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,120
sopranos, because nobody in the right mind would end a show like that. So anyway, on the DSC-617,

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,920
let everybody know that we'll get the ending back and let everyone to sopranos fans

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,360
will be satisfied. Capiche. Hi.

14
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Now.

15
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,480
Like the way you're doing. There's a time. It's myself. There's one more.

16
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,840
Because it ain't a crime, too. I really enjoy my life.

17
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,280
For love I know where you're suffering and there's time where you're out.

18
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,000
I love why I carried on and tell I showed up in love.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I love that love. There's never any need to try and guide that far.

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
To try and find out who I am.

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah.

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is a monster.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah.

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah.

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah.

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah.

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah.

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

32
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

33
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah.

34
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah.

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's the one.

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is it.

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's the one-off song from the summer.

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We heard it here.

39
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm in the name of the source code.

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Aren't you happy?

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah.

42
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah.

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's Koopa from the Pate Music Network.

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's another one of those Nigel Specials.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We've been bringing us all kinds of awesome music.

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Bring it on to the Pate Music Network.

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I just clicked on a link off of one of its weekly emails.

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You sent them out to a whole bunch of podcasts.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No idea.

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I have no idea what he's doing.

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I got to interview this guy.

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's for a future daily source code.

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Today was episode number 617 coming to you from the curry condo in San Francisco, Northern California.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
How are you doing?

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Wow.

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What a day.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
First of all, to be in the office and to be working with everybody.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
A lot of new faces.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
At least new faces to me.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The place is jammed.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We have two offices now.

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Actually, I think we're very close to signing a lease on a new space.

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But this is this non-smoking thing.

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
For some reason, I've been completely energized.

65
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And today was a really, really good day.

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And I'd like to start with the end of the day first to tell you that I got really excited

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
by the keynote, the Steve Jobs keynote that he did here.

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
As I told you yesterday, and you probably know, the Apple worldwide developer conference

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
is being held here in San Francisco.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So the place is crawling with macheads.

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And as we've come to expect from Steve, he did a keynote.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Now, this, of course, a little more technically oriented.

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Although, still pretty consumer-ish, I would have to say.

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Showing new features and, you know, of the mac and, I mean, you have, if you are, obviously,

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
if you're a machead, you probably already watched this thing.

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You might have even watched it live.

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Now, you have to see this.

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I got to tell you, I've got major wood for leopard.

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay.

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm just horny for this thing.

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The way Steve Jobs presents that stuff.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And there's all, it's just, there's cool, cool features.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And I'm sure by the time leopard comes out, there'll be a new faster

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
max to run it on.

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And, you know, we'll be able to take advantage of the 64-bit architecture.

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I mean, all the stuff that just, I have to make, it gives me really, really excited.

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And my via was just sitting there, you know, with its melted alt key from some

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
debris burning debris that fell on it.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's just kind of sitting there going, you, you thinking about their women.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And I have to admit, I'm thinking of a woman, her name is leopard.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And interesting move there by, by Apple to enable development on the iPhone by essentially

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
saying, hey, you know, you can pretty much do anything you want.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You can access all the functions of the forthcoming iPhone without having to, you know,

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
actually load an application onto it.

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Just use the Safari browser.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's the full Safari browser, the Safari engine.

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
They say, I guess with engine, it means that that engine can tap into, you know, so you could

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,000
write an Ajax web 2.0 script or web page to call a number or to access some of the

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Google map functionality or G wouldn't be nice if you could do something with it to

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
access the iPod part.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No mention of that, but it will be really nice for accessing podcasts.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But, you know, so essentially, it's, it's not a bad idea.

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And I also kind of thought, hey, you know, what's all this mumbling and grumbling about

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
developers?

107
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
When the iPhone was announced, it's like, oh, it's a close box and no one could develop on

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
it.

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And I'm thinking, you know, all the apps I really need are accessed either through Wi-Fi or

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
through through the cellular network.

111
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And so I presume that in order to get developers interested, they had to release a version

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
of the Safari engine for Windows, which they did.

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I downloaded it immediately.

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'd say not quite ready for prime time yet.

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And with that, I mean, it's incredibly fast.

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I have to admit it seems that the test that he showed that it really is faster than Firefox.

117
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But there's a couple of gnarly things in there.

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And I'm not, you know, there's no way for me to provide data feedback.

119
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But I'll tell you what's a couple of things are wrong right off the bat.

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
First of all, sometimes like Google notebook doesn't function with it.

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can click the buttons.

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It'll add a new note for you.

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
When you click in the field, you don't actually see any typing show up.

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
In fact, checking in other browser, no typing showed up.

125
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No text was entered.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So that's one problem.

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
In Gmail, when you use that, I can just tab once or twice depending on what field I'm in.

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If I'm in the editing field, editing a message or composing a message, just hit the tab.

129
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's the focus is on send and I just have to hit return.

130
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So I never actually have to use the mouse.

131
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That doesn't work.

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That function.

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It'll, it'll go to the send button.

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But when I hit enter, it doesn't actually.

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Maybe I have to hit to something else.

136
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Is there a difference between enter and return in this case?

137
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't think I have a, I only have an enter key, which is the return key on my, on my IO.

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So anyway, so that's just makes it completely unusable.

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No way to import my existing bookmarks.

140
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Sorry, that's not going to fly.

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I spend a lot of time on taking those bookmarks exactly what I want them to be.

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No plugin for, for the Google notebook.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So no contextual menu.

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
All stuff that I use is really important.

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And I'm sure it'll get there.

146
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But right now, it's just not quite ready for prime time for me.

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But still, I want one of them freaking phones too.

148
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's just like, ah, I've won it.

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh, what is it?

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What is it?

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
God, man, that stuff is so inspiring to me.

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And I look at, you know, some of the, some of the jokes he puts into his presentation.

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm like, wow, man, when you're really cruising,

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and you've got awesome products that people just really want and are crying about.

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And you can have so much fun.

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And I'm, I'm not envious, but I'm just, I'm inspired.

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm really inspired by that.

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And so that with some, some things that happen today,

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
just, you know, sitting down face to face with, with some folks working on a number of different things.

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
One of course is is continuing to make podshow.com or we believe it should be.

162
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And we're starting to surface things very, very slowly.

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And I've actually, I'd like to involve you in a test if you don't mind as, as listeners to the show.

164
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So we have this channel architecture.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And I, I don't want to go too deep into it right now.

166
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But it's, it is significantly different from any other site out there,

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the way they're using channels.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You'll, you've probably noticed if you visit podshow.com that a lot of,

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
actually, two things have really started to surface almost everywhere.

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Play buttons and get buttons.

171
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And they're very distinct now.

172
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You can't miss them.

173
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And, and, you know, please, just see this as a sandbox for right now.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Because things are going to change pretty rapidly over the next couple of weeks.

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You're literally going to see podshow.com change before your eyes.

176
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So one of the things that you may not have, you know, quite seen or used yet

177
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
is the fact that everything that you find in podshow.

178
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, that was disgusting. Excuse me.

179
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Everything you find in podshow, you can get.

180
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So if you create a channel and let's just, you know,

181
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
not even think about what that is, but you get a channel by default.

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So you have a default channel in podshow.

183
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
When you see a little get button next to a show,

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
then you click on that and it'll give you a list of all the channels you have available.

185
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If you, if you only have, you never create a new channel, then you just have one default channel.

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's fine. Just use that.

187
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So you can add it to that channel.

188
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And whenever that show updates,

189
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
the newest episode will be available in that channel.

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So if you go to your channel module, you can hit play channel,

191
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and it'll just kind of play.

192
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Now, all, we have so many amazing features that are completely hidden away,

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
which, of course, we have to now start surfacing up.

194
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
One of those features is that you can put a channel onto a mobile device.

195
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You can do that through an RSS link.

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, and actually any other device doesn't have to be mobile.

197
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Well, let's just make it real simple.

198
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You can put it on your iPod.

199
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And as you know, the way to get stuff on the iPod is through iTunes.

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So you can create a channel, and I have several of these.

201
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
In fact, I don't subscribe to single podcast anymore.

202
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I use, because this is some of the stuff we're talking about today.

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Like, you know, what do I really use pod show for?

204
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Well, once in a while, surf around, you know, look for stuff,

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
or I'll see who is listening to a show and see what else they're listening to.

206
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And of course, if I see someone who just looks hot, I'll click on them.

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Just to see what's going on.

208
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But I really use it to manage.

209
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't use the iPod at all, practically.

210
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I use my Nokia phone, the E61 India.

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And it has a podcasting application in it.

212
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And all I need, basically, is an RSS feed or podcast feed or channel feed,

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
or just it's a URL.

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And I enter that in and up comes my channel.

215
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And it automatically updates on my phone overnight.

216
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And the newest shows episodes, I should say,

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
of shows that are in each channel appear.

218
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So I have an on the go channel, which is a combination of, actually,

219
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I can tell you exactly what it is.

220
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Let me just go to my channels.

221
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I just have that all set up at atom.podshow.com.

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm getting to an interesting point here where I want you to help me out.

223
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So just bear with me.

224
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I just want to try and make this clear as possible.

225
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So you might on the go channel.

226
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I have quite a few shows, actually.

227
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I've got the New York Times front page on the media,

228
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
BBC NewsPod, the promo feed,

229
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
national inquire, or legend, Mike Walker's, the gossip game,

230
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Pacific Coast Hellway.

231
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So you can actually see that if you go to atom.podshow.com,

232
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
you can see what I have in each of my channels.

233
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So not all of these shows update to daily,

234
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
but when one updates, then it appears in the feed,

235
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and therefore appears on my Nokia.

236
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So the on the go is really, you know,

237
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I even named the channel.

238
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's for the train rides to shortage.

239
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So when I go to London, I know that the latest stuff in this channel

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
is just and it's short stuff.

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You know, it's like these are like 10 to 15 minutes show.

242
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Some of them live longer, but they just show up in date order,

243
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
chronological order.

244
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So that's essentially how I use podshow.

245
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And if I don't like a show anymore,

246
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
then I'll just get it out of my channel

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and it won't show up on my phone anymore.

248
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
If I find something new somewhere in podshow,

249
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
you know, a new show that I like,

250
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
then I can add it to that channel,

251
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
or any of my other channels for that matter.

252
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And some channels, I have show up in different devices.

253
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You know, like I have a,

254
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
we call Microsoft.

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What do you call that thing?

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Media Center.

257
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So I have some channels that I subscribe to there.

258
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Now, what we've done within podshow is

259
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
not just can you just get or collect or subscribe to shows,

260
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
but you can also do it for individual episodes.

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You can do it for the songs made available by an artist.

262
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
All of these have a little get buttons next to them.

263
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And you can even do it for images.

264
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And I believe, and we've kind of held back in a couple things

265
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
because it can get really confusing.

266
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's already quite a mind trip

267
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
when you, if you can follow along when I'm about to tell you.

268
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So because you can get individual shows,

269
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I can create a channel that you can,

270
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
that'll just, with stuff that'll automatically show up on your iPod,

271
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
or wherever you use this channel, wherever it is.

272
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So it's really, it's meant for two type of uses.

273
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
One is to play the channel in a web browser.

274
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And you can just do that by clicking play channel.

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And it'll just pop up a window.

276
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And the other use is to put this on a different device.

277
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So let's just say an iPod to make it simple.

278
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So when you, after you've listened to the show, or if you're in front of your computer right now,

279
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
you can do it now if you want.

280
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Just go to dailysourcecode.com and you see the DSC channel.

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And there'll be two links.

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
One to put it on your iPod.

283
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And the other one is a pure RSS link.

284
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So you can put that on anything that will understand RSS with enclosures.

285
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Nice little technical info there.

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We'll understand that feed.

287
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Now what I've done in there is I've put in a couple of episodes

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
that I think are worth watching or listening to.

289
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So I put what I put in there.

290
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I put just a random hit test episode episode number 42

291
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
just to kind of show that I can get something from way back when I put in.

292
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh, episode 85.

293
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I think of this week in tech.

294
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
This week in tech.

295
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Twitter.

296
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The one that I was a guest on.

297
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And I also put in an intro to the channel.

298
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
All just by using a mouse.

299
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So I didn't have to code anything.

300
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I didn't have to write anything.

301
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Anything I found online or if I searched for it because,

302
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
you know, we, of course, search across podcast,

303
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Ali and Andy Potter.org.

304
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And you know, we have a, I'd have to say pretty much,

305
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
a very extensive certainly of independent mainstream shows.

306
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And we also searched in the episodes.

307
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The search is not perfect yet totally down with that,

308
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
but it ain't all that bad.

309
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Anything you find you can add a single episode.

310
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You can add to your channel.

311
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So it's a kind of a different way of broadcasting if you will.

312
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Now I could use it as a companion.

313
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So for instance, if there, you know, I listened to a lot of stuff.

314
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So for me, if I, if I hear an episode that I think will be funny,

315
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
or you know, that I want you to listen to,

316
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'll just add that single episode to the feed.

317
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And it'll just stay there until I remove it,

318
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
which is another thing I can do.

319
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I can remove stuff from the feed and replace it.

320
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I could change the whole channel overnight.

321
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Now, of course, the stuff you already downloaded

322
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
would remain on your, on your iPod that would automatically

323
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
been brought in.

324
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But anything new would be introduced right there.

325
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And it'd be there automatically.

326
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And, you know, I cut an intro for the video.

327
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Which is pretty stupid one by the way.

328
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But I cut a video intro for the channel.

329
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But you don't have to do that.

330
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You know, it could be anything.

331
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It could be any type.

332
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Literally any type of media that you want.

333
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It could, it could just be a picture.

334
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So this channel will perform differently,

335
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
depending on where you're using it.

336
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Of course, if you have, if you don't have a video iPod,

337
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
video stuff is not going to play.

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm not sure about the pictures.

339
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I think pictures will probably display on a video iPod.

340
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But certainly everything will work in the dashboard.

341
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And so there's, you know, it's funky, right?

342
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We're figuring this stuff out.

343
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So I'm trying to keep it pretty simple.

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Keeping it just very limited to audio and video.

345
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I am doing a mixed channel.

346
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And I want you to take a look at that.

347
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And please, put it on your iPod.

348
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And, you know, let's just get a feel for it.

349
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And see if it's an actual experience that you like and let me know.

350
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And if there's anything that, you know, that you dig.

351
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Obviously, you can go out and you can get that show for yourself.

352
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And by now, I'm sure you understand that you can clearly.

353
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You can create your own channel and do this very same thing.

354
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So it's, it's kind of using Poncho.com as a utility.

355
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But in a very interesting way, because, you know, for me to be able to create.

356
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And now, of course, I'm going to create a channel with single episodes for Patricia.

357
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That'll just go on an iPod actually on iTunes.

358
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
She doesn't, well, she's used my iPod.

359
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But she just, she understands iTunes.

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And she'll understand how to go into it.

361
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And, you know, into a, just open up one little folder there and see if there's something new to play.

362
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And she'll get that.

363
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And so I can put all kinds of stuff in there.

364
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And I'm really moderating that channel or, or on the editor of the channel or maybe

365
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
maybe I'm just kind of like a broadcaster in some kind of bizarre to it twisted way.

366
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So again, go to dailysourcecode.com or query.com.

367
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You'll see the link there.

368
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It should open up iTunes automatically.

369
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Get the channel for you.

370
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And if you're using something else, there's an RSS feed for you.

371
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Hey, let's play.

372
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You will know by name.

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,740
podcasting communities done the word podcasting a huge disservice and

748
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,560
and the technology, it's not even technology, it's the presentation of

749
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,320
crap. It's because we can't explain it. It's like Tivo.

750
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,320
You know, Tivo has spent $300 million trying to explain to people what the

751
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:05,040
frick of Tivo is. And they failed miserably at it. But you know, when people

752
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,480
get a Tivo, guess what? They don't want you know, try and take it away from them.

753
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,200
They'll stab you and they will. They'll bite you whatever it takes to do not

754
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,200
remove the Tivo. So it's one of those things that you just have to show

755
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,760
people in order for them to understand. And you know, and again, I'm going back to

756
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,400
the whole job's thing today when he claims that there's half a billion downloads

757
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:33,840
of iTunes onto Windows computers. You know, I don't, that seems like a lot. But

758
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,760
anyway, when I want to ask someone, you got an iPod. Yeah, I got an iPod. Well,

759
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,320
have you ever seen the little word podcast in iTunes? No, I haven't seen it.

760
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,240
You know, the people that just don't see it. You know, it's just not on the radar

761
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,160
like that. But if I said, Hey, man, let me send you an email and you just click

762
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:57,480
on that link and you'll have a channel of of what we can call podcasts or let's

763
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,840
just say you'll have a channel of cool shit on your iPod. Now that, you know,

764
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,240
you don't have to explain it. It's like, ah, it got some cool shit. I don't

765
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,880
cool shit. Look, it's like, it's like shit. It's in trying to explain a podcast

766
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,080
thing. You said that people understand internet radio better than podcast. And I

767
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,320
was thinking, it's really not just internet radio. But it's kind of like internet

768
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:27,200
radio with something like TV or digital video recording. Yeah, okay. So that's my

769
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,760
point. And I appreciate what you're saying, but I don't think we should compound

770
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:37,200
the problem by trying to say podcasting is internet TV. It's not

771
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,400
just getting your shows from internet. But your computer actually collects your shows

772
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,600
in a way that a digital video recorded does so that they're downloaded and

773
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,800
organized and ready to do it. And those people are advertisers are afraid of

774
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,520
digital video recorders. Although I saw a survey somewhere where some results

775
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,000
of a survey crap. I wish I had that. I probably saved it somewhere. It said

776
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,920
that when Tvo users, um, misquoting is I think it was like when Tvo users

777
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:13,720
watch ads, um, they really want 30 second ads and not 15. So I don't know what

778
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,520
the hell it was. But I still, you know, hey, look, make the ads entertaining.

779
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Make people want to watch it. There are ads I watch and there are ads I'll stop

780
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,360
for because they're funny. Even the dam, uh, what is it? Uh, 1 1 8 1 1 8.com

781
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,520
ads that they had on before and after lost on channel. Or I watch that. Those guys

782
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,120
are dumb and makes me feel good to watch. Anyway, just thought it was a better

783
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,920
analogy. Love the show. Absolutely. Thanks a lot, Adam. Take care. I appreciate it so

784
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,440
much. Janice, will you please call back more often? And let me know what you do. And, uh,

785
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:55,120
well, I'll be remiss if I didn't ask for some naked pictures. Oh, shit. This is the one.

786
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Let's have a word with the nylon spread and the news with the smile on where the

787
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,360
wrong old right window for light. Let's listen for the wild and the nylon. Oh, yes,

788
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,480
he's back. And I don't know if I'm just missing his comments because he refers to it

789
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,280
as if comments are being sent. He's calling in every single day. But here he is. And he's

790
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,720
got a lot of crap on his mind. The nylon everybody. Yeah, I'm the nylon. I must be a little

791
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,080
reluctant to play some of my calls these days. Hey, that's what I'm talking about. I don't

792
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,920
receive your calls, okay? I don't know what you're doing, but they're not coming to me. This is the

793
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,840
first time I've received one since the last time you said I don't play your calls. It's too critical,

794
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:41,600
but I'll keep going. So first point is, um, John DeVoilac. This guy is a vice president of your

795
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,640
organization and vice president and most company means he's an officer of the company. Yeah,

796
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,000
no, no, no, no. If you're an officer of the company, you're an officer of the company. If

797
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,080
you're a vice president, vice president is not like an officer. Officer would be a chief executive

798
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:07,760
officer or chief technology officer. BP is vice president, not officer. But I think your point is

799
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,000
well made. You know, he's he's, he's dedicated to the success of the company. Yes, he's a stakeholder.

800
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:20,480
And I, uh, yeah, stakeholder. And, you know, he's committed to maximizing the value of the company.

801
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,560
Well, as is everyone at Pod Show, everyone at Pod Show is a stakeholder in the form of options.

802
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,200
So they, uh, they absolutely have a stake in, uh, in a number of different types of outcome.

803
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,840
I found them a couple of times. The guy doesn't know what his job is. You know, the

804
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,560
PR release you put in, devour, devour act is always trying to stumble to say,

805
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:48,000
I, what is Ron Bloom mean by all this hyperbole? Guy is in our particular about what he does.

806
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,480
And it's now three weeks. And I'm sure we hear something. But I think most of your listeners

807
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,240
and audience are also confused. You know, you know, nylon, um, after you, hopefully just listen to

808
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,200
my whole rant about channels, go back and reread the press release. And by the way, you know, I had

809
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:09,760
John on the show. Ah, something stuck in my nose. Hold on. I had John on the show. And we

810
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,160
laughed about the press release. It's a press release. It's for the press. It's not for bloggers

811
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:22,160
and nyloners. It's a press release. You know, old school, old world. You know, there is still

812
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:27,680
a need for that. And it's sometimes is quite useful. Now, but go back and reread that and maybe

813
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,040
something will start to dawn on you as to how we're putting all this stuff together.

814
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:37,120
The icing on the cake is Twitter 100. He's on there with Leo. Leo is the show by saying, John,

815
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,400
anything you want to plug? John plugs his blog. Nothing else. He's a vice president,

816
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,160
a part show. He should be plugging. Nothing. Two minutes later, Leo prompts some. Leo comes back

817
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:54,320
and prompts him and says, how about part show, John? And then John comes in. What kind of officer

818
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,760
of a company needs prompting to talk about his company? So two things there. First of all,

819
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,520
we're very happy with the work that John already does. His writing, his own blog,

820
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:17,040
cranky geeks, his appearances on CNBC. And of course, this week in tech. And I mean, how

821
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:24,080
lame would it be if he went around and all these shows, all of a sudden promoting his, you know,

822
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,560
he doesn't, well, he does promote his blog. But not like, hey, you know, I've got a blog. It's,

823
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,280
you know, he'll say, I wrote about this on my blog. And I'm sure in the future,

824
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,560
we'll say, oh, I said this on tech five, which is unofficially soft launched, whatever the hell,

825
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:43,120
that means tech five dot pod show dot com to ECH five. I think tech five FIV might also work,

826
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:50,960
which should. You know, so when it's in reference, then it's relevant. And of course,

827
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,840
we'll talk about it. But there's, you know, we didn't buy, you know, if I wanted to be on Leo show

828
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:03,760
with a pod show commercial, I'd fucking buy a commercial. You know, that's not, that's, you know,

829
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,960
these are existing things, existing existing work he was doing. There's no need to do that.

830
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,080
That's just kind of lame. And Leo prompted him. That's right, Leo really asked him, I heard the show.

831
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,000
And so John told him, I think that John was even, you could probably hear he was unprepared for the

832
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,360
question. He wasn't intending on talking about it at all. You know, there's a right time and for things

833
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,480
and a right place for things and a right moment. And, and that wasn't it. So I think, you know,

834
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:39,680
maybe just being, uh, fucking decent nylon. Um, quite the confused. He doesn't talk about it on cranky geeks.

835
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,120
You know, this sounds like a very titular fuzzy sort of relationship to have.

836
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,880
I give it one year, you know, the guy doesn't seem to be totally aligned and engaged and committed.

837
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,320
Good. You know, what are you? Now we'll sudden you're the media pundit. I give it one year.

838
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,120
Shut up. See attributes for a single officer. Last and not least is back to Trinity. You may not

839
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:08,480
want to hear it, but, you know, this meant my ride. You know, this is a great idea five months ago.

840
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:15,360
It was audience generated, audience energize, audience customize, everyone was pushing the ports for

841
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:21,120
open. They wanted to get on the Trinity band, Reagan. Nothing's happened because you're trying

842
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:28,000
to get a sponsor's logo on poor little Trinity. Let's not monetize Trinity. It was a good idea.

843
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,840
The audience was behind it. Let's get it over with. Run the thing, of course, the US, let everyone

844
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:41,200
pedal 25 miles back home. Um, you know, three Trinity is free from the tent. Stop monetizing everything.

845
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,280
It's the hall. It was a nice idea. The audience loved it five months ago, and by

846
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,560
forgetting that it's an avenue focused on your audience. What's going to bring them some joy. So,

847
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,160
oh, I don't know. All right. I'm going to say you're you're right on some of that. Absolutely. The heat

848
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,400
was on five months ago. Now, I totally believed that the heat is there. But there's a couple of things.

849
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,800
First of all, um, in putting this together, you know, this is a corporation where they're

850
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,760
you like it or not. Uh, and I am an extension of a corporation. And so there's a couple of things

851
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,600
that we have to do properly. Um, insurance is really part of it. So, you know, and so the minute you

852
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:25,040
even start looking into that shit, guess what? I'm busy. And I hate looking at that. So I got to

853
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,160
get a producer to do it. You know, producers not free. Yeah, because, of course, I could get someone

854
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,640
to do it for free. And I could, you know, find people just enthusiastic. But I want things done right.

855
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,640
I think this is a big project. And it's, and honestly, it's much bigger than I ever expected

856
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,480
to be just thinking through the logistics of it. And no, I mean, I don't want, uh, to have to rely

857
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,440
on people spending their own money to do deadhead trips. You know, in one way, because, you know,

858
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,840
you're going to drive some part of the right. You have to get back somehow, eventually, unless you

859
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,680
had it planned that way. So then you're into logistics. You know, there's a lot, a lot of logistics.

860
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,160
Yeah, we could have seen where we got with it. But it's my fucking car. You know, I want to do this

861
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,720
ride. It's not like, oh, I'm just throwing my car. It's my car, all right. And, you know, the car is

862
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,840
also has had a lot of problems. Oh, Rosie, she hadn't even told me about the latest, uh, Trinity

863
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:28,960
Clamter Port on us. Uh, apparently she would not no longer accept the key. Uh, I'm going to

864
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:36,720
get a locksmith over and it's like 200 bucks for a new lock ignition, the ignition. So she's in the

865
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:43,280
garage now here at the condo. And, uh, you know, as I think everything that that could have broken

866
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,480
has broken and everything that need to be fixed has been fixed. So anyway, there's definitely

867
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,360
costs associated with it. But I want us to have fun with it. And so you're right, you know,

868
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:02,240
I was, I was ill-prepared, um, to take advantage of the, the, the wave that came.

869
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,080
Although I do totally believe we can rekindle that when the time is right. And that time is going to

870
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:15,200
come. And yes, um, I am actively looking for a sponsor. It's not necessarily me monetization,

871
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,360
okay? It's like saying NPR monetizes on their sponsorships. You know, sometimes you just need to

872
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,240
sponsorship to make something work. I just don't want to do this ad hoc. There's just too much

873
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,240
involved. Um, for me, I mean, someone would have to manage it regardless, regardless. You know,

874
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,000
Barbara was putting all together. She put a proposal together. And she wanted decent money, you know,

875
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,960
to manage the whole thing. Uh, and you have to pay anyone, anyone's a decent money. And it's a,

876
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,840
it's not like a day project. It's a three to, it's like a three-month project, I think,

877
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,160
with preparation, with a trip, you know, this actual work involved. Now, that said, we, I think we're

878
00:39:52,160 --> 00:40:00,000
very close. And that's what I alluded to last week. We're very, very close, um, to a relevant sponsor

879
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:09,040
who really wants to step up and step into this project. And, you know, I'm excited about that.

880
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,240
And so if that possibility is out there, and that's for real. And as I said, I would

881
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,320
have an update on that this week, you know, then I think it's worth waiting for.

882
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,560
I think we can still have fun. There's a saying in Dutch about did it to fotsit for your

883
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,880
need. Uh, and of course, it, uh, has not translated it all. Uh, but whatever's in the barrel

884
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,480
is isn't going to go sour. Adam, I beg you, don't become tip my call version 2.0,

885
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,480
3 20. Don't let Madison Avenue and logos touch her. It was a great idea.

886
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,360
Ah, I feel better. You're so, uh, my one.

887
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:57,200
Nylon. Um, I really don't like you, but I really, really, really do appreciate

888
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,640
you calling in and giving me a piece of your mind. Whoa, he's an island.

889
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:10,800
Fucking expatriate. He's in London, buddy. He's from New York. Whoa, he's my

890
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,080
love. Country versus the island. He's in London, buddy. He's from New York.

891
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,600
All right, how about we kick it right now with some new black lab. This will be in the

892
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,320
pod save music network later this week. Here's transformer.

893
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,880
Transformers.

894
00:41:51,600 --> 00:42:01,040
From the sky above, it's not that you can do. You're fair, the strike will be in the place

895
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:09,440
the world, where your call was through the crimp, and how the evil make it strong,

896
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:17,760
transformers, more than he's the Earth, transformers,

897
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:27,600
move on to the sky, strong enough to break the braveest heart.

898
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,560
We have to fall together, because it was a part,

899
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:44,160
standin' by the wheel of Charlie Paul, until I'll talk to someone,

900
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:56,480
I will save a song, transformers, more than he's the Earth, transformers,

901
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:08,400
move on to the sky, transformers, all of us, ways have bound to destroy the evil force alone.

902
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,840
Let the static out.

903
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,880
Transformers.

904
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,560
Transformers.

905
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Transformers.

906
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,560
Transformers.

907
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,160
All right, I stand corrected.

908
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,720
It's not exactly going to be pod save any time soon.

909
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,160
Turns out the official Transformers theme sucks.

910
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,320
So, fallen in, you're back a lot beside a date.

911
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,400
It looks a little take on the official theme, but the fans aside.

912
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,320
Leave a lot of evolution and be my friends.

913
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,840
There'll be a video out on YouTube of that tomorrow.

914
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,400
Which reminds me, I'm just waiting around now. I don't really have time to go trolling YouTube,

915
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,040
but I'm so convinced that within a day or two we're going to see the real

916
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:29,680
official ending of the sopranos. I think there's going to be a viral explosion of people creating

917
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:36,960
funny endings, dramatic endings, endings they act themselves, endings that will be spoofed,

918
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,880
takeoffs, etc. And quite honestly, I'm really looking forward to it.

919
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,320
We talked a lot today about a lot of stuff. One more thing, I know I'm asking a lot of you,

920
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:54,000
so besides clicking on a link, I know it's quite a task and check out what you think of my channel

921
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,800
in iTunes, or maybe just some of you may check it out on your iPod, others, only on iTunes,

922
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,560
or whatever you are. Let me know how that goes for you. And if you have a chance, I'd like you to

923
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,960
become a member of the super panel. This is a whole suckless thing you've been talking about.

924
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,600
We really want to understand more about you. I want to understand more about you as my audience,

925
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:21,280
and we'll know that you're a DSC listener, and you'll also indicate what other things you

926
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:27,360
listen to. And if you're a part of the super panel, then it kind of continues. And you don't have to

927
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:33,120
do every single survey. I realize that what I'm doing here is basically saying to you as a friend,

928
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,600
hey, just put my arm around you. Hey, when we go down to the mall, and when those people ask you

929
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,640
to take the survey, take it, okay? Now I understand. It can be a pain in the ass, but I really

930
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:49,200
would appreciate it. And soon advertisers will also be asking you through us as a part of the

931
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,560
super panel, what you think of ads and how they're placed in podcasts, talking about pre-roll,

932
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,680
post-roll, host endorsements, all this stuff. We get lots of feedback and you tell us lots of things

933
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,640
about what you feel and what you think, but here's an opportunity to actually tell us. So the

934
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,840
questions, very basic right now, but they are going to become extremely targeted also for other

935
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,280
countries. You know, this is going to be a long campaign that's going to, you know, the

936
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,800
suckless inserts are going to go away, you know, within a relatively short time, you know,

937
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:25,280
the whole point is we got your attention for a number, in a number of ways, I'd really like that

938
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,560
and I really appreciate if you take the survey for me. And I'll send you one of my naked pictures.

939
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,040
DailySourceco.com, add on podshow.com, looking forward to talking to you guys tomorrow. Bye.
