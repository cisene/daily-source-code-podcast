1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Hey, man, that was a great party last night, man, I had so much fun and whoa, dude, you're

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,560
not looking so good.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,520
Yeah, I guess I should kind of confess to somebody, last night when I got home, I was

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,760
so drunk, I blew chunks.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,080
Hey, man, that's cool, everybody, you know everybody throws up sometimes, as long as you

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,360
hit the toilet, it's okay, man, it's no problem.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,120
No, no, man, you're on your stage.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:38,880
That's, that's sick, that's football, that's like DSC642 football.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,880
In a world where TV networks, movie studios and record labels still think they can

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,400
govern what you see in here, one man has the power to return control of entertainment to

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,440
the masses and make big media corporations wet their tiny little pants.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,080
In Pod Show, home of the world's most dangerous new content comes the daily source code

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,680
with Adam Curry.

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,120
You know, I remember back in the day, back before Adam was, I don't know, making cheese or

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,680
whatever the hell this cheddar project is, you knew what day a DSC was going to come out.

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
He wasn't that busy and pretty much this was what he did all day, sat around, checking his

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,360
email, pulling down audio tracks and getting ready for the DSC.

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,840
And now it appears he's gotten a little bit too big for a daily podcast, so he's going

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,720
to put out for a week and you're just going to have to figure out what days they're on.

20
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,320
So I don't know if it's going to be a food bar Friday or a meaningless Monday or what

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,760
day it's going to be, but this is the daily source code 642.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,640
It was $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,280
renew content in my ears.

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,880
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

25
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Just like wich is a black mass in it.

26
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Oh, people, minds and blood is structured.

27
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,760
So far out of debt's construction.

28
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Oh, even the feet of bodies burning.

29
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,760
As the warm machine keeps turning.

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,760
Oh, there's a big kitchen in the sky.

31
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,760
Oh, poisoning their rainwater.

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,760
Oh, water.

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,760
Way down.

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,760
Way down.

35
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Way down.

36
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Way down.

37
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,760
Way down.

38
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,760
Way down.

39
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Way down.

40
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Way down.

41
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,760
Way down.

42
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Way down.

43
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Way down.

44
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Way down.

45
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Way down.

46
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Way down.

47
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,760
Way down.

48
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Far down.

49
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,760
That's an opener.

50
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Black zeppelin.

51
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Black zeppelin.

52
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,760
It is the daily source code episode number 642.

53
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
How you doing everybody coming to you from the swanky server.

54
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:32,760

56
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,600
I think I have every single one of them in use so we'd have to go get a new one and I swear to God

57
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,800
He said, oh, you know, because I can't use the power drill. If I don't have the extension cord

58
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,000
I think all of Geoford is sold out

59
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,960
I just because I love because he does awesome things with the with the power tools

60
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,560
So whether once again looking pretty nice today

61
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,400
We have I think we'll probably have about 70% of the day will be sunshine and lots of people sending in comments about

62
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,840
a good friend who tried to explain El Ni単o and La Ni単a

63
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,680
Paul Shepherd

64
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,480
Clarkson says, look, let me just tell you how this works. To understand the complex El Ni単o

65
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,560
La Ni単a phenomena, you must know the following and pay attention because when you look at the weather report tonight

66
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,280
You look at it in a whole new light and by the way we gloss over weather reports so easily it affects everything in the world

67
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,760
As you can see from recent news reports particularly here in the United Kingdom number one all weather is driven by the sun

68
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,560
This is really important when the sun has its activity and you know the sun is not a stable source

69
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,760
It you know, there's bits of sun spots and explosions and extra heat here and there

70
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,160
It does affect the weather and it is the primary source of what affects the weather

71
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,840
And it's not really the other way round, but that's a whole other global warming question

72
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,360
Number two, the sun heats the earth's atmosphere unevenly

73
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,200
Important to understand unevenly is not one consistent source wind is moving air

74
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,200
And air moves from high pressure towards low pressure areas

75
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,720
You'll see this on the chart tonight when you look at the weather report high pressure air masses are cooler

76
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,960
than the low pressure air masses

77
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,080
Low pressure air masses are less dense than high pressure air masses

78
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,040
And low pressure air masses can hold more water vapor than high pressure

79
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,680
Air the high pressure air masses because there's more space between the various air molecules

80
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,880
Which of course means you know clouds they can hold a lot of rain, right?

81
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,680
So that's the the real fundamentals weather is an amazing thing pick up a book one day and take a look at it

82
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,680
It could change your life. It really good

83
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,480
Of course then we have good old GD Martin for a green dragon from the bite-sized bonus podcast to btpot show.com

84
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,640
He always relies on the the old string barometer hang a piece of string from a nail on the shed if the string is swaying

85
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,080
It's windy

86
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,840
If the string stand sideways it's very windy if the string is wet it's raining if the string is dry

87
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:37,400
It's not raining if the string is stiff it's freezing if it casts a shadow it's sunny if it casts no shadow

88
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,160
It's cloudy if it's invisible

89
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,160
It's nighttime and if the string is smoking well your sheds on fire

90
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:52,520
Once again time to open up the extra microphone because she's here to tighten my buttocks any nice exercise

91
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Famie that

92
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,400
I can think of a single move for you this week, so I think we're gonna have to improvise. Okay. I'm I'm game

93
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Stand up

94
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
And squeeze

95
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Those cheeks

96
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,200
Relax okay, squeeze again deep breath and

97
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Sweet

98
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
Please

99
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,840
Like I like oh can I look relax. Yeah, thank you. Oh deep breath and last time

100
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
squeeze

101
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,560
And relax

102
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,400
Is that it? Well there you have it until next time

103
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
That's what I call phoning it in Amy

104
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

105
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,680
Doesn't matter how I love you

106
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Fantastic

107
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,880
Amy Mac

108
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,320
She's gonna be our first VJ on the plus TV which I can't tell you about yeah because I don't wait to find it until it's ready

109
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,960
We still have some technical stuff going on. It's gonna be 24 hour a channel of like just the best video shit

110
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,200
You can think of not only from pod Joe, but from around the globe my friends

111
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
um

112
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,280
Let's see so what should we launch into there's a couple of things I want to talk about one is the iPhone

113
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,560
I want to keep you up to speed on that because I am of course an X-pat with an iPhone in the UK

114
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,280
And I've used it now for what four five days something like that

115
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,800
Consistently okay, let's talk about this first of all

116
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,200
The bad real life

117
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,720
Although good for a cell phone without a doubt it does not

118
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,360
Just doesn't cut it compared to the E61. I I could use that thing

119
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,840
For hours and I mean my days are 12 hour work days

120
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,600
Really full-time work not just you know being around but phone calls etc etc

121
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,840
phone calls and email I say and calendar and yeah, that would be it

122
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,000
I did not use to listen to many shows

123
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Excuse me

124
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
on the on the E61

125
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,600
Because you know it doesn't have a dual headset it just has you know you can listen to it on speaker

126
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,520
Or you can listen to it through one little earbud unless you get some kind of adapter thing

127
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,120
In which I didn't want to carry

128
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
But that battery would hold out

129
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:23,960
longer so yes the iPhone gets just about eight hours of full-time usage including your iPod usage and your your browser

130
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,480
etc, but it does not make it through an entire day of one of my days

131
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,720
I'm still way completely down with the browsing experience. I think this is the way to go

132
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,840
You know it's going to be virtually impossible to convert the entire web

133
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,080
You know to work on mobile browsers and you wouldn't think it's just a lot easier to

134
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:55,480
Really focus on the technology and make the browser on these mobile devices better and I think that that you know Apple has set the bar right there and and that's just the end of it

135
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,920
It's fantastic. It's

136
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,360
Fantabulous if they had flash nothing not not for YouTube videos, but you know just for some basic flash stuff

137
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,440
Which I think the phone could handle it would be even better, but I don't really miss that

138
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
And I love it got to tell you love it

139
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,720
the

140
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,320
Well, you know

141
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,880
Let me let me play this comment to your first. This is uh

142
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,000
Can always expect it from your family. This is from my sister in Italy. Here's Willow

143
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,440
You traitor you you I feel like CSB

144
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Era

145
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:38,760
Convincing everybody to get the E61 I including me your sister. I was also happy. I got it three days ago and I'll happy and then what do you do?

146
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
You turn around and go get an iPhone

147
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:49,320
With a battery life. It's so good and the screen and the browser and everything is so cool

148
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,320
There's only one

149
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,600
problem with the iPhone you have to synchronize

150
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,200
The worse you need iTunes

151
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,680
I am against iTunes. I hate synchronizing. I hate iTunes

152
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,320
So I'm gonna stick with my Nokia. I've been with Nokia since

153
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:16,680
1995. I love my Nokia. I love my new Nokia and I can just grab the podcasts out of the air without synchronizing

154
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,640
Okay, I have to admit the podcasting application. It's very basic. But it works. It's functional

155
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,480
The player definitely needs improvement

156
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,200
But I'm gonna stick with an Nokia also because I spent a lot of money on it and

157
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,240
iPhone I don't think this is a road. I'm gonna travel with you

158
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,920
Anyway, that's all. Chop it or that. Chop it or whatever that means

159
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,400
Oh man and that was that was the the nice version of what she told me on on the phone when we spoke a couple

160
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
days ago

161
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
You know, but

162
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,640
Really I think we should look at an analogy. Let's look at the road

163
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
The road being the network

164
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,960
Road system and let's look at cars the cars being the the devices you connect to the road

165
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,800
And you use the road with you know to to travel across it

166
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,880
You know if there was just one car that would work for everybody we'd have you know

167
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,040
It'll be driving Volkswagen's you know that would have been that would have been Hitler's vision

168
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:31,800
Or we could all be driving fiat 500s or the douchevo or you know there's a million a million different types of

169
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,600
Examples of people trying to say okay, you know, this is the one this it has everything

170
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,680
It's it's just not gonna happen that way. There's trade-offs everywhere. So it's not as simple as saying

171
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,480
I only need one mobile device

172
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,480
It just doesn't I don't think it works for anybody you have different mobile devices

173
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,680
For different occasions really which is why I believe the whole SIM card technology of essentially, you know

174
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,720
There's your your little card and that contains

175
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,640
Your personal information so your phone number it can of course can contain a number of standardized

176
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,280
You know contacts it can't contain all of my contacts because I just have too many

177
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,720
But it can contain a lot of the the ones you can just you should be able to switch from phone to phone for different reasons

178
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:24,200
I have also been using the N800 over the weekend all that also has its advantages, you know, so it doesn't have a cell phone built in but

179
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,080
You know, it has a touch screen. I like navigating with my fingers that that works. It has a I have to say the

180
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,960
The touch pad keyboard is better

181
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:42,440
I feel then than than the iPhone's not in in visual cues, et cetera, but it's spaced better. It's it works better from my fingers

182
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,160
You know again all of this is personal preference. It's by the way. You should be able to change that on the iPhone

183
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:55,480
We're on any virtual keyboard not every keyboard works for everybody. You know, I have the Sony via which has just about the largest keys

184
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,480
You've ever seen in your life

185
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,040
When people get on the on my laptop to you know to use it to type that's the first thing I say

186
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Oh my god these keys are so big in this or widely space. Well look at my hands. I get the boy's got big hands. What can I tell you?

187
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Yes, it is true

188
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,400
Um

189
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:20,520
So I believe that there is no Jesus box. There is no magical machine. There is no, you know, God's gadget that has everything

190
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,760
But you have different you know different material for different missions. It's just like airplanes. It's exactly the same thing

191
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
You know, could I get a jet?

192
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:36,120
Yeah, I could get a jet, but you know, it would cut my my missions in half. You can't land at hill versus airport in a jet

193
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,760
You know, you can you can barely land in a in a twin that has to be a you know one that's

194
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,760
Specified for it, you know grass strips are going to be a problem noise abatement all kinds of different reasons

195
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:53,000
Let alone the cost you know if I just want to fly across the channel it's a lot more efficient a lot easier

196
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,320
And I can get to where I want to go in the Delta Sierra you know it's all about the mission profile of what you need to do

197
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
so there is just no

198
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,120
no standard

199
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,200
No standard mobile device that is I think going to work for for everybody

200
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,720
But if you know I think in certain situations

201
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,440
I would trade off as well. I have been carrying all three devices. I'll let you know in my

202
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,080
Back I'm not taking my laptop the laptop stays pretty much at home and docked

203
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,160
But I'm taking the an 800 the E61 I and the iPhone and that's mainly because I can't switch out the SIM card

204
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,640
You know and just take the one device. I think I'm going to be needing for that particular day

205
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,320
The other thing the iPhone does extremely well

206
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:46,040
Better than than Nokia it's just fucking better is switching between the mobile network and the Wi-Fi networks

207
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
You know I have a cloud

208
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,800
You know the cloud dot net in the UK it's it blankets most of London most of the city with a white with Wi-Fi coverage

209
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:03,720
And I've been a lot of cabs recently in the city and you know, so I can be you know doing my mail or looking at my calendar or going through

210
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:10,840
You know my news reader which I use a Google reader for that the mobile version which is just fantastic and I can literally see

211
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:18,280
Switching between networks so I'll it'll go real fast right and and I'll so I'll be on the cloud and then I might get into a dark spot

212
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,400
Or it's trying to switch over

213
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,160
It'll immediately pick up the GPRS access and then it'll switch back once it has another Wi-Fi spot that stuff

214
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
They did extremely well

215
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,920
So

216
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,920
It's no such thing as the best the better

217
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:38,920
But as always, you know with with with Apple and and pretty much everything else the experience is just lovely is just a nice

218
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
It's like a greasy smooth

219
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,920
warm

220
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,720
Yes indeed almost almost a

221
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Sexual feeling

222
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Can't help it it's the truth

223
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,440
I've missed in co-ordinate cutter that's for those you just tuning into the source code thing what the hell is going on with this cheese

224
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,880
Still

225
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,000
Chitterbee cheese cheddar kind of sounding like channeled or if you say it fast a couple hundred thousand times which I said

226
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,640
Certainly these bad many times in the past few weeks

227

Oh

242
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Welcome to daily source code

243
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,000
Uh-huh

244
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:46,280
Yeah, I saw about a thousand channels created over the weekend people starting to try it out and I noticed something really interesting on the iPhone if you and you know we have the RSS link now

245
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,400
Next to every single channel so you know you can play it in a variety of ways

246
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,400
If you if you're using the iPhone and you know a patch out our com looks looks great in fact the channels page is just

247
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,920
Look awesome on the iPhone if you zoom in and you click on the RSS link it'll then bring up

248
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,840
That channel

249
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,600
Through it's interesting. It actually goes through a dot Mac like proxy, but it doesn't matter how it does it

250
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,240
It actually brings up a nice page which you can bookmark

251
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,160
Which becomes

252
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:23,000
You know the the channel page on your iPhone and if you're connected you can get any of the content in you because most I would say most

253
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,000
Independently produced

254
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:31,640
Video these days is is done in quick time. Yeah, it has the pew has the pew Institute done a study on that please

255
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:39,960
Yeah, I would have to say that the original fire material most of it even the stuff that winds up on YouTube is probably created in quick time

256
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,480
I could be wrong

257
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,240
But I have a sneaky suspicion about that so of course

258
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,320
You know the quick time is integrated very nicely into the iPhone and it works man

259
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,440
You pop it up and because you know I have it all set to I think every single show in my channels

260
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,040
Like my on the go channels all set to one to poop out one show at the end so it's really clear all of a sudden

261
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,920
Instead of all these episodes mixed through each other you can't really tell what's what now. It's you know

262
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,960
It's obvious. I know what I know I can see what what these shows are and I see if I've played it or not. It's

263
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's really nice. I also messed around

264
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Using a couple of freely available widgets

265
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,000
To create channel widgets some examples of that at curry dot com really excited. I've not

266
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,640
You know I'm actually enjoying now that I can manage this stuff a little bit better

267
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,320
I'm actually enjoying shows that I completely forgot night subscribe to

268
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,280
Because they were coming out so and frequently that they were pretty much pushed down to you know the bottom of the list and I never really get to them

269
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,680
Or never see them and so all of that's changed and I really I've also gone through a little bit of you know

270
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:49,560
Reorganary management of of my media and can't wait to start building some dynamic channels stuff that

271
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:56,040
Pod show will build out of connections that your channel makes because remember you know if if you have a a show

272
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,720
In one of your channels and someone else has that same show

273
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,040
In one of their channels. Well, that's going to make some kind of connection there that we should be able to surface

274
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,080
A lot of that is kind of like LinkedIn. I like the way LinkedIn does that we run and I worked on that over the weekend and

275
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,600
You see how these connections are made that's basically people

276
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,280
I think that there's a connections in relationships between people in media and media media and people and

277
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:26,440
Where I think we're coming up with some pretty pretty interesting stuff and that'll all be reflected in the new UI

278
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:35,080
Which is being worked on very hard as we speak and only two more weeks and that's off to the states for the big curry family reunion in an upstate in New York

279
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,320
Actually an armunk

280
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,320
It's gonna be awesome

281
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,600
That's where I'm gonna see willow of course and the kids and and Uncle Don right this is it's actually now Uncle Don's house

282
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,400
So finally we're gonna have the big Uncle Don interview

283
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,760
Which will probably mainly focus on North Korea, but I think we can talk about George W and the guy has a lot of experience

284
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,480
You know he was in multiple governmental organizations and is now the CEO of the

285
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,680
Korean society so I think he had a quite a large hand in the in the most recent negotiation so looking forward to that

286
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Then of course nice weather here in the UK

287
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,920
You know Adam

288
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Cameron eat from Australia

289
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,880
Is it getting here I'm not I don't understand here. I'm actually from New Zealand

290
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,360
I'll just listen to

291
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Do see 641 in you talking about

292
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:29,240
Some nice looking people in Australia and some nice looking men mate the second place is full of bad

293
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,080
I believe in people that need a bath and I'm sure if it's quite a few family trees that don't fall

294
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,600
Can this town either

295
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,480
They just go very cool because there's a lot of children's marrying and a lot of brothers and sister seven six

296
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:47,000
They're actually nice people about our people at least some real fucking he'll believe down here

297
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Lepa show

298
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,600
I don't believe you. I've been to Australia. I only saw beautiful people. I didn't see any ugly people

299
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,560
You know hey for those of you it down under semi pictures of your girlfriends and wives will ya?

300
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,840
I'm I'm certain that it's pretty people down there

301
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,160
Please and if you want to send them you know as naked pictures that's okay, too

302
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
I am it's the candy man here

303
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,120
Sorry about all those long-text messages

304
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,280
I look the candy man from Nokia. Yeah, look look look look look look look like you know

305
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,040
It's that I barely respond to email these days because I'm just too busy

306
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,480
So now he sends me text messages and they get broken up into 15 parts

307
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Hey question for you

308
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,120
Has to BBC you'd become evil

309
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,920
Today they launched their online video service which they call I play or I think and

310
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,880
apparently it uses

311
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,880
some kind of X

312
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,760
Controls there so you can only use it with the internet explorer and you're not able to use it with

313
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,640
Mozilla or Firefox or

314
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,840
Hopera or even Safari so has to be the sea going from this kind of open and friendly company to an evil

315
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
Deceptive media house

316
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:09,160
Let me know what you think thanks. Why I may be a little bit harsh there Luke, but I there is a lot of talk about that the BBC has released

317
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,720
Stay what they call the eye player and it is kind of their version of podcasting

318
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,960
You know they they're trying to walk the thin line between

319
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Don't let people keep stuff and use it or reference it or go back to it. You know make it disappear after seven days

320
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,280
So they can it's a catch-up service not it's not an alternative distribution with that's kind of the offensive part

321
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,480
And the reason why they chose Microsoft

322
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,560
Technologies because of the digital rights management, you know

323
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:44,600
It essentially will handle all of that stuff for them. So that's not evil. That's just the choices they make as a license

324
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,400
Payer as a pair of for the TV license saying about 136 pounds a year

325
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:59,480
I feel that they should have done a little more investigation and probably made that a little more accessible to people indeed with

326
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,400
You know if people said windows 95 I don't know if it will run on that. I think you explicitly have to have

327
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,480
Who still has windows 95 with the fuck am I talking about no one as we know

328
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,960
more maybe

329
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,520
It was it's a professional edition 2003 or whatever

330
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,760
But no max no Linux no alternative browsers

331
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,520
So I don't think that they've done their homework properly and they've they've rushed to get something out just to you know quote

332
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,560
Compete with what's happening with video online

333
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,960
Honestly, I think it's a shame. I hope they don't get rid of all their podcast links because I think that stuff is awesome

334
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,960
I I consume BBC

335
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,240
Programming all the time you can see it in my channels go look at my on the go channel you see the daily

336
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:50,680
Breakfast which is a compilation of stuff that they put together of a video show in the morning. I love it, you know, and yes

337
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
I'm willow. I'm

338
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,480
Once again roped into iTunes, but it's it's okay, you know, it hasn't crashed on me yet

339
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:04,520
knock on wood and and when I sink the phone up in the morning it's it's got my shit on there, you know and and other stuff

340
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,080
I'll just find through through the web browser

341
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,000
channels

342
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So I hope they keep that and I don't know

343
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,160
From a competitive standpoint, yeah, it's great because you know, they're just not gonna be getting the same type of traction

344
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
I registered for the eye player

345
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:27,800
It appeared to still be in beta or beta as we say here and and I was waiting for confirmation email didn't receive any so I'm not sure if it's public

346
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:33,800
If I'm going to the wrong link or I don't know it doesn't seem like they did it really is simple release something that's easy to find

347
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,840
oh well hey

348
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,000
Since I missed the food bar Friday, I have hit test number 80 queued up for you

349
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
haven't heard it obviously

350
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,520
But it is one that young created just before

351
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,520
He got the the terrible news that I talked about on Thursday and

352
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,680
And Gary sent in a message which he said you know didn't necessarily have to play publicly, but I do want to because uh

353
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,640
Young and his wife Victorian went through a really bad experience

354
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,400
Or she miscarried their child and

355
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,760
Oh, here's Gary Alexander from the ultimate podcast and mind you this is the guy

356
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,360
Who's into ultimate fighting and cage fighting and stuff and oh, he's a softer side to him

357
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,400
Hi Adam is Gary Alexander from Vegas

358
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,400
Listen, I just listen to Thursdays episode and that would be this is basically just for for you and actually

359
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,080
I don't have it. I really don't know much about y'all pull it

360
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,000
This is what I hear when you show, but this is actually

361
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,840
You know something that maybe you could just tell him that you know

362
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,520
I don't know so let me know how to get touch with whatever. I've been in the same boat. We are my wife and I have lost

363
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,680
Two babies one as a miscarriage and one is a steel birth that eight to have months and

364
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,920
Actually there was a there's a beautiful story because along with my daughter Bella that

365
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,640
We lost it eight and a half months

366
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,960
Wonderful butterfly story is just a beautiful thing and I

367
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:11,000
I really can't help but to have my heart go out to this guy and I'm sure that there's been a lot of people contact him and tell them that they've been through the same thing

368
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
too many people have

369
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,680
I do a lot of work for the march of dimes and I'm very appreciative for all that they do for children and

370
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
development and research and

371
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:28,040
Kind of the big thing much of the arms is a huge huge huge supporter for for that kind of

372
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,720
Up tragedy so

373
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,280
You know, let them know that the next donation that I make will definitely be

374
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,280
in their name and I really really do

375
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,360
Just feel for them because I know all too well

376
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,200
So

377
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,800
That's my time. Thanks

378
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
All right man. That's so beautiful. Thank you

379
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,080
And I love the fact that you you called it a a butterfly story. I think that was a reference to my mom so

380
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,720
I appreciate it very much

381
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,080
No, students

382
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,440
Recording this on my Nokia 770 that I got for a grand total of

383
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,200
75

384
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Great British

385
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Anyway

386
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,240
Cheddar

387
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,640
Got a small problem with it. You can have a look on my

388
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,480
Daddy Dows at poncho dot com on daddydows dot poncho dot com

389
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,960
My little feed of gone there which is called freaking cheese F or iKKI and cheese

390
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:35,000
I've put some feeds in there including the DSC one of one of my favorite episodes from Tiki bar where La La

391
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Shets her snakeskin

392
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah, it's too best of you cute

393
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,200
Um, which were really good but they're not showing up in my feed and I choose

394
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,760
I wonder if you can explain that one because I can't I've tried adding it taking it out

395
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
Having it taken it out no doesn't work

396
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,920
So yeah, good concept as you know I understand it but yeah that one doesn't work which is a bit of a pig

397
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,280
Just me all right. Yeah, you figured something out all right

398
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
So the the YouTube stuff

399
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,360
Is flash-based and that's really where your problem stems from because

400
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Excuse me

401
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,000
I don't even have a sponsor to tip tip tip tip today do I that way I'll I'll pimp cover girl

402
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,680
They're launching with it is blibromouth up yet blibromouth TV

403
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,040
Blibromouth dot com I think it is blibromouth dot poncho dot com anyway

404
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Um

405
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,560
Those are currently not being put into the downloadable feed if you were to play your channel in the mashboard

406
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,600
Which is a selection right there you can say play channel or just select play and mashboard from the drop down

407
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,320
Then they will show up

408
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,320
But obviously

409
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,040
If your phone well, I I don't know does your I guess your phone does understand flash so

410
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,640
We could put that in we could put the actual flash files in I'm not sure if they're going to play properly

411
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,880
This is where you get into a whole bunch of problems the good the same goes for pod safe music

412
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,040
You know the the whole point of the pod safe music network is we're not making them these songs freely

413
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,960
Downloadable for anyone to just go and grab but they're you know

414
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,720
They're available for producers to put into their shows and then promote the songs

415
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,800
So again if you get an artist on podshow.com

416
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,520
You will be able to play that artist songs

417
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,520
In fact, they will play nicely in order through the mashboard, but they're not downloadable and that's because

418
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,120
We don't have the rights to make them downloadable if we could change that. Oh, man that would be awesome

419
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
And of course the question is

420
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,160
I mean, I know I know the immediate answer, but there's there's maybe ways around it. What if

421
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,320
You know there's a best of YouTube

422
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,960
There's a YouTube clip that's put into someone's channel and we were to transcode it back to say mp4

423
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,280
So would play on an iPod or just you know playing general if we just

424
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,040
Transcoded to age dot 264 or whatever the norm is these days

425
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,000
That is of course theft

426
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Because you're you're taking someone's content and transcoding it now we can report that back through technology quite easily

427
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,440
We could tell the YouTube server. Hey, you know we got a download of of this video so out of view count

428
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,840
But that still doesn't remove the whole idea that it has now been been downloaded onto a device and it's kind of free so

429
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,760
I don't have the rights to do that James so it's not that we technically can't do it. It's that

430
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Well, we technically legally can't do it

431
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,920
Uncrafting casting with Adam coming

432
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,120
Hey Adam

433
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,360
Are you ready to be stumps bring it on?

434
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,360
He's the new test

435
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:48,360
Yes, we've got a problem. Let's do it. Hey Adam. Are you doing this great is it does number 80

436
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,800
And we're going to start right away. So here we go. This is intro number one

437
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,640
Easy easy easy

438
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,160
Do we lose ham the news that would be the power of love from back to the future?

439
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
I know I got that one right number two

440
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:20,600
I'm going to have to say I'm stumped on that one. I did not recognize it at all and today's final intro number three

441
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,600
I'm doing that far out of the I know that one

442
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:35,000
That is Mick Jagger. I think with Michael Jackson and state of shock an awesome collaboration between the two and times up in these hardy answers

443
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,880
And to number one from 1985 he will lose and the news

444
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:58,200
But it's a power of love

445
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,480
From 1985 he will lose and the news and the power of love

446
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,200
I happen to hear we lose and this is answer number two the Meg band roses are red

447
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,480
Oh

448
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:44,840
And so number two from 1988 the Meg band and roses are red and this is the third and final answer from 1984

449
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
This

450
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,880
Answer number three

451
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:11,640
The Jackson's together with Mick Jagger you come you come you come me in the state of shock and state of shock

452
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,920
And that's it for it this is number 80

453
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,920
I

454
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,880
Must tell you that it's a real challenge every time to

455
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,800
Edit those tracks back to about 30 seconds and well one tracks better than the others

456
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,760
Well, it all depends on the track itself

457
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,480
It's a kind of fun to do

458
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,160
That kind of stuff, so I hope you had them all and you enjoyed this one Adam

459
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,480
Info about this hit us the answers and items you can be found and hit us the partial dot com

Next week call the back for hit test number 81 so until then take care and bye-bye

461
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,880
Yo, y'all my man thank you so much

462
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,040
You know that that's second one

463
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:11,800
I you can play that for me again and I still won't get it but man I love hearing the Jackson's with Nick Jagger again

464
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,920
Gosh, and what are we your combination when you think about it? Can you just imagine those guys in the studio together?

465
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,080
Red pill blue pill moment a lot of people sent me this and and I know Patricia and I have talked about this on the show a couple of times

466
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,720
about the and it's not just the

467
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,080
Penelope cruise laurel commercial which is

468
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,520
For mascara and if you haven't read this of course, I'll put a link in the show notes

469
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,400
This just shows you you know how incredibly

470
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,880
Deceptive advertising is now for four years Patricia's been saying this and I'm sure

471
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,720
Several times throughout those years she's mentioned it on the show she she really despises these

472
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:57,320
mascara commercials the same goes for Kate Moss with Rimmol and in fact in this article you say they'll even a loot to it that it's a

473
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:05,640
Industry practice to essentially put fake eyelashes on the women who are demonstrating the wonderful

474
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,800
long-lasting lash extending mascara which of course is crap

475
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,840
So finally

476
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,040
Who is it the advertising standards authority?

477
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,920
Have called them out and said this is misleading

478
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,520
in particular the

479
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:29,240
Penelope cruise laurel commercial who said right here it's common industry practice to use artificial lashes

480
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,680
That's such a harsh shit oh

481
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,440
Man

482
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,960
Particularly cosmetics and what do you think photo shop is used for?

483
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,880
You know go look at Vogue magazine tell me everyone looks that beautiful. I

484
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,480
Yeah, it's unraveling right before I very eyes my friends. It's happening. We're too smart

485
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,320
We're figuring all this shit out and we're calling people out on it and it's gonna

486
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,600
Cause for a lot of confusion. It's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better, but it's gonna get better

487
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,320
Hello, hi Adam

488
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,600
This is Shane and Amy from a year at the wheel back

489
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:08,200
Yeah, this is Shane. I am not Shane and Amy. I mean guys are like in the and only one speaker

490
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
All right

491
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,360
We've got to work on your audio set up my friends if you're gonna take Trinity out on the road for a year

492
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,880
Well, I'm Amy. No, I say people adjust you from now on as Shane and Amy you like that. Yes

493
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,520
Especially because my name comes first

494
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
So we've been mulling over the

495
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:34,360
Reasons the tour should start in Chicago. Yeah, and Chicago is the place to be isn't that we're all the politicians

496
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,840
Come to win the Midwest and when they win the Midwest they win the election

497
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:45,080
True. How about the Democratic National Convention the riots that Mayor daily same we preserved this order here

498
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:50,680
Was that the 68 one? Yeah the night. Oh, yeah the 1968 Democratic National Convention exactly and that's where the

499
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,760
Hamarket riots were what the hell does that have to do with anything? Wasn't that we're the

500
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,280
Anarchy party was born? Oh, well, okay, we'll talk about that on a podcast on a year at the wheel

501
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,960
But also Adam, you know, I have a lot of surprises for the listeners and the viewers out there and one of them is

502
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,080
I scheduled a free the West Memphis three kickoff here in November fifth

503
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,840
Since we'll be in Chicago starting November fourth for ten days

504
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,560
As one of our 20 host cities

505
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,960
We're going to do a free the West Memphis three

506
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:28,280
Concert on November fifth as part of our kickoff. We're host of it. So you think they'll ever get free

507
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,480
Free free as in

508
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,520
podcasting is free to the people yeah

509
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,120
The West Memphis three free. Yeah. No probably not

510
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,120
But anyway Adam Chicago's where it's at pizza hot dogs

511
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,760
Good for right and we have this. Oh, did you hear about this press conference? We're doing November fourth

512
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,840
With Adam Curry. Yeah, he's gonna be in Chicago. We're hoping that we're gonna do this press conference

513
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,720
That's right there. It'll be exciting Adam Curry's gonna be there and it's the center of the country

514
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,480
That's right. All right. I'm convinced already. Oh wait. We're talking Adam. We didn't tell him he's gonna be in Chicago in November fourth

515
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:07,880
Yeah, I'm so there see in November fourth in Chicago. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm so there. You kids you wacky kids

516
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
yeah, so why don't I get

517
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,960
Doug

518
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,960
Doug and his son to drive Trinity from San Francisco to Chicago and then we'll kick it off

519
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,640
Just before we get and and I guess I'll ride maybe I'll ride with him. I don't know

520
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:27,320
I don't know we want them to have their father son thing. Okay. November fourth press conference in Chicago

521
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,920
We got to have a lot of people coming. It's gonna be fun. We'll throw a party somehow

522
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,440
I like it he kids. We're now working out budgets

523
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,720
It's gonna be uh it's still a big project even though it's it's not a big project it is a big project

524
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,200
Because I want to make it rock you know I want these guys to be comfortable on the road and I want them to be able to

525
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:52,520
You know get us as much material as possible and I really really like the idea of this changing year

526
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,040
People looking at alternatives not just for alternative energy, but just alternatives in general. It's an election year

527
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,800
I think it's a really good tie in and and let's talk to people

528
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,800
Let's find out what they're thinking on a day-to-day basis. It's gonna be pretty darn awesome

529
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,120
I got like five or six audio comments left. I'm gonna save those for tomorrow and

530
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,240
Play a song that I found on the podcast music network. This has been getting a lot of pod play

531
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,760
It's one of the most played songs at the month actually

532
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,880
It's from a suspended mind

533
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
different California

534
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,440
Track of this is years from now it starts off a little slow, but

535
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,000
