1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It was $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm just kidding.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's Adam Curry.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let her drop.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Delta, see her turn.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Episode 6-07.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hey, everybody.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
How you doing?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It is late on Thursday evening.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm back at the manner.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Don't worry.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's not another flying sound scene tour.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's been a pretty busy 48 hours.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Maybe even a little bit longer.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And I'm really, really tired.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And tomorrow on the maximum music footballer Friday, I'll be happy to tell you all about it.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For today, though, we have a special S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:47,120
S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-P-S-S-S-S-U-S-R-I-C-S-S-And-E-T-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-E-S-A-D-D-S-S-I-S-S-S-E-O-R Freeienst, CH

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:54,120
That really makes me feel good when I hear someone enjoy something like that, basically.

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:01,040
Not really an experiment because I've done these recordings before and the responses are exactly

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
perpendicular.

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,280
People say I don't, I'm not interested, hated listening to it and it was way too basic

25
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,520
and then the opposite because you really should be listening to an episode like this in

26
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,160
the car.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,440
Because you're in the same type, this is totally, it's theater of the mind.

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,760
You don't need to close your eyes to be in the cockpit with me.

29
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,400
If you turn this up, your car is actually vibrating.

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,600
If you haven't listened to that in the car on the speakers and it does seem to work for

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,000
a lot of people with earbuds, but really trying to get it on a nice speaker system and

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,400
that by the way, completely uncompressed, un-tweet, non-filtered recording of exactly what

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,080
was going on in my ear, I will tell you, I just use this little love microphone, I stick

34
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,440
it into my ear and then put the headphones on so it's picking up the intercom, it's picking

35
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
up the radio.

36
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,880
The radio, by the way, there's something fucked with it, I've got a, I'm trying to get

37
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:06,240
that fix, it's not very clear, it's a little unintelligible and I'm just on the reception

38
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,560
side, I'm actually having some trouble hearing what people are saying and I went with

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,000
the cat and yoss and that's a story from another day, you flew me, you flew co-pilot

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,840
and safety pilot to Darmstadt, oh man, I can't so much shit to talk about.

41
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,760
Hi Adam, it's Will from Essex and the UK again, I'm getting a bit concerned, and I've

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,280
got to be honest, I haven't listened to all of your shows, but what's happened to Roger?

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,840
His Roger Smalls got, because I think I'm most of the TV to highlight, and I haven't

44
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,400
had the ring, I haven't had just me, and more importantly I haven't had a dodgy phone

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,680
microphone action and him doing his card and bit, I don't know, I'm going to be worried

46
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,320
about it and so I just wanted to keep you doing the chemical or you know, the text or any

47
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,120
amount, because I'm sure you got it's competitive, I'll just pop around to his house and

48
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:10,680
just take these, you know, in the right, dude, I feel really bad, I don't think I've

49
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,640
looked at Roger sight in such a long time, Roger Smalls.com, is it was it Roger Smalls

50
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:27,440
thought, I think it's that log, spot.com, Roger Smalls.com, that's interesting, leads to

51
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,280
OS X training.com, okay, we're not looking for that Roger, Smalls are blogs, okay, Monday, May

52
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,800
seven, so it's been a little while, it's got, oh, it's got another weird stuff, hmm, it seems

53
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,400
depressed, oh man, you're right, I don't know if I'm going to go to his house, but I think it

54
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,520
is a good idea to check up on him. Hey Adam, this is Dan, just wanted to say that's over

55
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,080
it, I'm going to put it into your PSC 606, your flight to the channel, great piece of that podcasting,

56
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,920
I've been listening to your show for a while, and that was a great piece of what you did there.

57
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,960
I work in an office, I guess you must have flown over the top of our gas platform, as I

58
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,960
think it was on route. Anyway, take care, really enjoy it, all the best, Roger Bye.

59
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,280
Hey man, if you're on the gas platform, get me the coordinates, get me the GPS coordinates,

60
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,640
because I don't know which one is yours, I'll fly over, and we'll set a time, and we'll like

61
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,480
to take pictures of each other, do something radical like that. The prize definitely goes to

62
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:42,320
Bell Flyer, who said Minimil, who said enjoyed the flight, what do you say? What was the

63
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,120
interest to you? Okay, here it comes, I thought I heard a bounce. This is only a fucking

64
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,200
pilot could hear this, because yes, upon landing, I bounced a little bit, keep that flare

65
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,080
going until you, until the stall warning, if you can, Cessna's will bounce above 80 knots, yeah,

66
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,720
I know, I came in a little too fast. I can't believe that someone actually heard that,

67
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,680
just with the audio, because I'm not saying anything, and you just have to listen to it, because

68
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,560
actually, revved up a little bit, but the bounce, I thought it came through ever so slightly, so

69
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,480
oh, I have a James's back on the line. Yeah, Adam, pretty, James, just listen to your little

70
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,000
films, so you're into a nice little bit of a difference. You mentioned it, Jeffrey and Jeff, I'm

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,120
guessing that's a helicopter, but I'm not a aviation person, but I gotta use to fly helicopter,

72
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,160
you don't, you don't, let's do enough, just a question, sorry, I'm not next, okay,

73
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:46,560
James, I gotta tell you, man, that I am so jazzed about what's gone down in the past couple of

74
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,520
weeks with how the flying's gone, but yeah, I miss it terribly, and now that the nice weather's

75
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,880
upon us, I'll definitely get some chopper flying in, and I don't know, if you guys like it,

76
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,200
I'll do another, I think that actually, as we move into the German market, and again,

77
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,080
please, after the weekend, we'll talk about that and what's going down, but we are definitely

78
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,600
coming to thank you, everybody, for sending me emails, with your great insights on the market.

79
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,160
Actually, I felt my German kind of start getting a little bit better, while I was there for a couple

80
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,960
days. Anyway, so I feel that, you know, there'll be plenty of opportunity, or maybe that the

81
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,120
only time will be able to do a show is when I'm flying, which is okay, because it gets pretty lonely.

82
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:37,520
And speaking of lonely, here is Mr. lonely himself. It's been a while and great to have him

83
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,400
back on the show.

84
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,840
On a second, I didn't receive any messages.

85
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,240
Why do we need to get to those? No, no, no, no, please, something went wrong. I didn't receive

86
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,240
any, I haven't received anything from you since I started asking for you to call me.

87
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,480
Crap, I hate that.

88
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,400
Shit, man. Would you try doing the the UK now or just send me an email if you called it?

89
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,280
I really, really hate this, so please, let's try and make that word better. Let's try and

90
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,600
suck less on that. Anyway, dude, what's with the show in the airplane? I'm on. What's

91
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,000
focus group that you listen to that said? Or your audience wants to hear you as a sound of your voice.

92
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,800
It doesn't matter what you're saying. It's a show. I listen to a show and I'll wait a minute.

93
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:52,560
Did I imply that at one time you didn't find the show? By the way, it was an episode of a show.

94
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,160
You didn't find that to be entertaining or a show. I was, I was definitely putting on a show.

95
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:05,200
I was multitasking and you probably know from your own experience, man, on good multitaskers.

96
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,320
Your voice, respect to audience, give me a show. You know, which raises my second point.

97
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,120
Is this show a hobby or a profession? Is this thing to me that this show has just been

98
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,920
getting in the way of your flying? Which I thought was your hobby and the show is your business.

99
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,400
Oh, dude. The flying is to get around to enable the business to happen more efficiently.

100
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,000
At life gets in the way in general. I'm confused by all this. So, hey, dude.

101
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,560
Um, what's the show? We don't just want to hear anything. What are the show in the topic?

102
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,040
You know, on Delta Sierra, Charlie, you know, let's get the show back on the road.

103
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,160
You know, what happened to Larry King? Hey, wait. Which brings my last point tomorrow's football.

104
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,680
Oh, whenever you're footballer. And I think the part-face network has to be a little bigger than

105
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,400
White rock and roll bands. Okay. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

106
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,120
Now, this, you got to listen to this. I'll just let it play. For some reason

107
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,360
nylon is, is, is, is confused. Well, he's definitely confused. Saying that, have you ever looked?

108
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,040
Have you gone to potter.com slash music? Have you ever looked at the categories?

109
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Now, they're white rock. What is white rock music? Jesus.

110
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,720
This network has to be a little bigger than white rock and roll bands. Are there no jazz or

111
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,960
does out there? Are there no R&B artists in the pot safe? And as soon as you see the word jazz on our site,

112
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,040
there are R&B. Click on the link. I mean, maybe even there's some classical people.

113
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,400
Oh, classical, click on the link. Yeah, but let us expand this to, you know, beyond just the white rock

114
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,920
and roll bands, jazz. The audience in the world and then podcasting is bigger than that.

115
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,200
So I'm back. Say flying. Good thing we don't have to get a return trip. And that's what you

116
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,880
assume. That's her dick. Not a lot. Hey, nylon, nylon. Look at me. Look at me. Turn around.

117
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,440
Now, bend over, bend over. Stand over. This is from the pot safe music network.

118
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,800
You get me to know that. I just love people when we're naked. But you've had a buckle up baby, baby.

119
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,600
Because I won't make you scream. We can't tell lies. I'm so about the way I walk. I can't help

120
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,280
what's ever in the twinkle in your eyes. You've made the switch. If you want to get next to me,

121
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,120
I've got you wonderful stuff. So messin' with you, please. Yeah, I can't help but follow.

122
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,280
Has you stay with your drops and the breeze roll through my hair. Condition up on the cliff.

123
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,400
I've got you written and cold won't flash you. And I was smelling my perfume.

124
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,240
It was a roll like I'd you all stew it to all you need. Baby, we can see the poignant stuff together.

125
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,560
Dancing next to me. I've got to get my travel window. And you my eye just thought in the sweat.

126
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
Want to get between my body down the bed. Looking that low so I say,

127
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,600
have no. You almost want your legs when it turns to double. Close your eyes for a second.

128
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,360
But you're tongue on my neck. But you lost yourself. Try to take that for a second.

129
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,240
Step, step, step, step.

130
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,680
Mistimcially, step, step, step. I'm the kind of girl to make you hollow.

131
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,640
I'm out, you shouldn't be in the next to me. If you get better,

132
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,800
find your baby for your tongue runs out and run out. Mistimcially, step, step, step.

133
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,040
I'm a kind of girl to drop you and stay in the rain. You want to see who impress me.

134
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,400
You're better bringing up for the funnest champagne. Just what it is,

135
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,960
because you haven't figured it out yet. What draws you see me? You ever sent your first set to eyes on me.

136
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,400
You want to get to know me way better than the one that you went so ready.

137
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,840
You get the one you little feeling whenever I walk by. You try to take a deep breath

138
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,360
and then you let it stop. What do you think about me? You're not a good stop.

139
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,240
One takes to this baby and you'll never get enough. And I'm just trying to drag me to let you discover.

140
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,400
Hold on my seat, where's that you want to come from? But don't fall for your words. You only get one chance.

141
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,040
I got you, you're not in the touch. Me, so you ask me to dance.

142
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,680
So I want you to sing so mesmerize and sing so gentle. I forgot to fan the side and die.

146
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:08,120
Mistimcially, step idea. I'm a kind of girl to rob you and save you and save me. You want to sing so mesmerize,

I've got to so much nervous and I think it's sweet

152
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
But I don't need a minute or two left

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800

But yeah, will you better make you move before I disappear

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,920
I'm feeling that's coming

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,320
Yeah, I'm gonna find your game before you throw runs out

174
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,960
From the very own Proxy music network

175
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,680
J-me mysteriously sexy and nylon seems to apparently matters to you

176
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
She's white

177
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
The savonth specials

178
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,000
Okay, it's a time for our savonth from our series of the circle of savonth

179
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,240
Dying the self-interference of savonth

180
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,880
So long

181
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,920
I think I'm gonna be able to get at least one savonth in episode

182
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,640
There's a fast forward button on there for a reason

183
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,600
And I hope to be able to talk to a savonth every single day

184
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,920
savonth

185
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,200
And by the way, I want you to know that this format change doesn't mean that

186
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,560
I don't still want to make it pictures make it pictures

187
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,680
By the salt and the sense of savonth savonth

188
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
So with me now

189
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
one of the biggest

190
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
Superstar savonth

191
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
In fact, he is the Mac Daddy of savonth

192
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,480
He is the true J-C of savonth

193
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
John C. Dvorak

194
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Hey

195
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,520
The funny thing about that savonth thing is that I was once called the columnist savonth

196
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,000
By the Washington Post. I thought that I always thought that was amusing

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,200
And they were quite new at that moment

198
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,560
Did you tell us not so you didn't take it as an insult or compliment you just didn't

199
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,840
Well, the way I see it, I'm kind of like you mad

200
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,800
I mean, you know any you way the publicity by the pound

201
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,520
Yeah

202
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,080
Or the kilo depending on what I mean to that day

203
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,600
Well, yeah, well you're in Europe

204
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:37,920
So

205
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,920
I

206
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,240
Think the news is a starting to spread to quite well by now that

207
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
You've joined Pod Show as

208
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:54,240
I'm going to right here the Vice President of Managing Editor who will be producing a new breed of technology channel

209
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
You know, how could I resist?

210
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,400
Didn't you make all the title and everything up?

211
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
You guys made up the title

212
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,280
But this beside the point the fact of the matter is that I you know I decided I'm gonna actually turn

213
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,520
This experience into into a into a speech. I you know, I give these these speeches around the country

214
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,800
I keynotes and whatever

215
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,840
But you know

216
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,880
The funny thing about the whole podcasting scene is that it's just so mirrors

217
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,280
What's happened to newspapers and print with online publishing and I just

218
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,400
Can't not see it happening exactly the same way and for exactly the same reasons

219
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,600
For broadcasting it's just it's just the way the numbers work out

220
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,760
This is the future so I so I was really enthusiastic about

221
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Jumping in on this one so

222
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,840
I've been looking around the web and a couple the there's basically two things that

223
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,480
Of course gets repeated and copied and linked to over and over with with something like this

224
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,000
And by the way John welcome. I think it's it's awesome that that you've made this decision of come on board

225
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm already loving working with you

226
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,600
But I'll suck up some more later so the ones that the yeah, right the two things people want to know

227
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,560
Action my contract by the way. I have to suck up to you. Oh really and is that on Tuesdays and Thursdays because I do have that

228
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,040
No, actually, you know what it specifically says in section three five days a week. I only get two days off

229
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,880
in

230
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
2000 and four

231
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,640
25th of

232
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,920
October

233
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,760
You wrote in your column on PC magazine about how you just didn't see it happening with in fact

234
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,440
I love this list if podcasting such and this becomes popular and you describe what your experience was of course

235
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,120
This is early days then it's placed in the pecking order for all forms of fun entertainment would be as follows

236
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,480
I love this on top circuses night clubs

237
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,160
Movies sporting events cable TV network TV county fairs talk radio PBS

238
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
Whittling fingernail clipping and then podcasting

239
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,560
I'm a laugh riot. I had to say and I remember you writing that and and I probably thought at this at the time

240
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,720
Fucker, I

241
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
We'll show you

242
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,400
But you know the funny thing is it's like I did the same thing with blogging and

243
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:23,840
I mean actually wrote three or four columns and some of them same kind of like snide, you know, you know humorously

244
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Positioned

245
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Policy papers essentially and

246
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,200
You know the blogging thing of course I got into a couple years or a couple years ago in 2004 and I now

247
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:42,800
Actually think about it because I could have probably gotten into blogging around 1998 when like Leo the port over at ZDTV was

248
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,680
Was blogging already because he jumps on anything

249
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
that happens and

250
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,560
If I had done that I wouldn't you know, I'd probably be retired. It just like it was it was I

251
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
tend to do that people don't understand this quite

252
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:04,880
You know, completely my my normal fan base does because I know I'm always like experimenting with with my current thinking

253
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Is that I like to

254
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,200
Look at a technology or an idea or something new like a trend like this and then I'll I'll

255
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,520
Try to try to see everything that's wrong with it and then expose what I think is wrong

256
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,280
And see what kind of pushback I get I you get different kinds of responses to some of these negative pieces that I do and I'm at natural

257
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,200
If you know I've taken

258
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,600
Vocational tests and I it turned out to be

259
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,840
People it comes up at the top of the list. I swear it's

260
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Critic it's like that might

261
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,640
I'm not telling it's the truth. I've done this more and more and

262
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,160
Every time it comes up number one what you should do is become a critic

263
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,600
So anyway, so apparently I have like critical genes

264
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,320
So I'm very critical and that's why you should don't jump on things like you know the second that they happen

265
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,840
But what I do is I criticize it and I go into great details or I'll do something very snide like that

266
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,000
This you mentioned which was quite funny by the way

267
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,320
I do say so myself

268
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,160
But anyway, I'll get I'll get blowback on that and I'll start to reanalyze and reanalyze and then pretty soon

269
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,440
I get a clue now with the podcasting thing compared to the blogging

270
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:21,200
I kind of got a clue. I think a little faster on the whole thing it did it it didn't take the you know

271
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,720
What one two three four five it didn't take six or seven years for me to figure out that that

272
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,600
Content management software was a great thing because it allowed people to like bypass

273
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
You know complicated systems

274
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,080
But with the podcast and think because I'm so in tune with what's happening to newspapers

275
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,000
I just realize it just dawned on me talking to both you and Ron

276
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:50,640
The CEO of Potcho that that it's like exactly what's happening to newspapers is going to happen to broadcasts because

277
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,080
Just the cost you don't have to have an antenna you don't have to have a first class radio telephone guy running it

278
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,080
You don't have to have a big staff you don't have to have amplifiers. You don't have to you know

279
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,000
You have international poll. I mean it's unbelievable and it's just exactly the same mile away

280
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,120
What's happened to newspapers is that they have they're overhead

281
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,440
It's like they have to print the papers. They've got a buy ink. They've got a buy paper

282
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,160
They have a distribution issue which is by the way another thing that radio broadcasters don't or TV broadcasters

283
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,560
Don't need when you have the internet you don't need the distribution network. It's built into the system

284
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
So what I and it went at that dawn. I mean, so this is the end of you know

285
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,200
Conventional thinking I got I got I got a clue a little faster here

286
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,680
So I love these press releases. No, actually I fucking hate them because they never a press release

287
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,960
Never puts in hyperlinks to anything. They just mentioned all these great

288
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,320
Properties and all these fantastic things that we have and that you've done and and they never put a link

289
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,000
But anyway, did you actually say this in the let me just read your quote

290
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,880
Technology has given us this massive new distribution medium and yet our approaches producing technology content

291
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,840
has been in the same old predictable style comments devourack by working with pod shows new channel format

292
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,720
We can combine entail of entertainment and insight

293
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:18,000
Ron wrote this I can't believe entertainment and insight and take the concept of integrated programming to an entirely new level. Did you say that devourack?

294
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,240
I think I may have said each one of those words at some point in my life

295
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:31,040
Well essentially, okay, so what's interesting is that and the way people that what we saw on interrupt you

296
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,000
But people out there who listen to this show. I mean you have to I I can explain a few things

297
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,840
But the way they should know everyone should know and by the way when I do I'm going to be doing the tech five report on

298
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,600
On the pod show network, which will be a daily thing that people should subscribe to but and I'm going to

299
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,760
reveal some of these kinds of weirdness is that take place with the press release. A lot of the stuff is written

300
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,720
Not necessarily by the person that's quoted. I believe what I said there though is not contradictory to anything

301
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,720
I believe it's just not something I was specifically said at any given time. I just want you to know what I said

302
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
okay

303
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,440
In life technology is no longer in the back row seat. It is now taking center stage. I got to do the dramatic voice

304
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,280
Pod show tech which is the channel you'll be building or whatever it is John

305
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,360
Will reflect that change says Pod show president and co-founder Adam Curry John is the perfect anchor

306
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:35,040
Combining his legendary insight on camera personality and extensive roll of decks to keep to help keep us fresh the channel fresh informative entertaining and relevant

307
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,840
That's pretty good. That's pretty good sucking up isn't it that was a good quote. I got one of that so

308
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:49,280
We split you know, we actually we met a long time ago. What was it 15 years ago, maybe now? That's too long

309
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Was a 93 I think

310
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
14 years ago

311
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,720
Cnet's formed yeah, it was 92 or 93 could have been 15 but I think it's 14 because you know, we were both on the original

312
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:07,200
Staff of the scene if the phenomenon which it was only it was a cable channel at the time

313
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,240
They didn't in fact I registered seen that dot com for them. Oh

314
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,440
Did you now yeah for haulsie and

315
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,560
Shellbee and in fact I hosted their email for I don't it must have been half a year or something like that

316
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,400
Yeah, you know that I don't think the I don't want to

317
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,960
Talk out of school here, but you know, I don't think the public generally realizes what a geeky nerd you really

318
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,960
Let me ask you a question John

319
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,680
You know, they made an offer to me at the time to

320
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,920
You know to move out to San Francisco and work for Cnet

321
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,920
Which would have been a very substantial

322
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,560
Change of life for me. Oh although I I really was tempted by it

323
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,120
There are a number of reasons why I wasn't going to leave and wasn't going to do it, but the deal they offered

324
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,560
Which was you know a reasonable money to do it. It was they are so still some risk

325
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,600
But there was like a whole shit load of options

326
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:06,080
Yeah, and I was just wondering if if the deal that you could you did launch with him you launched with the channel I believe and you were there for

327
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
God knows how long

328
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,360
And then you know, did you ever make any money off of that to those options? I mean was that a a good set up?

329
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,280
I was actually a I never took the there's a couple deals that were offered to me

330
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:28,720
And the deal I took was kind of a was unless I didn't want to really throw everything at those guys because I wasn't like a big fan necessarily of

331
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
See halls he had came up with his initial

332
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,080
schemes were to do a interactive TV play which was something it was dying and they kind of just stumble onto the internet

333
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,600
After the fact and it was and it wasn't until actually then I didn't actually refuse to do a deal with it

334
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,920
Right at the bat when you were still talking to him. I was done and then when they brought in Kevin Wendell

335
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,160
Oh right talk they talked to me into doing some workform and so I did some stuff there

336
00:25:52,160 --> 00:26:00,000
But it never you know I got some options. I never but I didn't make the kind of I mean I if I had jumped in when Wendell came on

337
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,600
I would have done pretty well for myself

338
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,920
I did I made some money. Let's put it that way but I didn't make the kind of money that Richard Hart made

339
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:15,600
Who's the guy who took your place crack and Richard Hart is retired now and doesn't apparently doesn't do anything

340
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Last time I saw him was in a theater

341
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,040
He was sitting there was a full beard

342
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,560
He didn't you couldn't recognize him

343
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,120
I mean I didn't I don't want to say look like a bomb

344
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,760
But that's funny. You look better. Let's put it that way. So I think you did well

345
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,920
But you know it was a pretty risky situation at the time they did great

346
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,120
I actually should I could have probably pushed myself into a really

347
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,760
Important job there and

348
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,160
Then I would be retired myself, but yeah, you know, I'm not like I'm starving to death. Let's face it now and

349
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,440
The other question that is just popping up everywhere

350
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,040
Is does this mean he'll no longer be on twit

351
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,200
Yeah, it's funny people like the you know the twit thing is

352
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,280
I don't know what these guys are like twit is like some sort of a weird phenomenon. It's a kind of a call

353
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,920
It's a cult showing with the huge following. No, I'm still doing twit. I mean twit consists for me

354
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:17,040
I mean I actually actually do some work here at Pocho. I got to like you know produce a page and do stuff

355
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,280
Oh, oh god damn page. Well, actually I have to say well, no, no, but I'm bringing some other people on board

356
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,280
So it's not going to be like I'm just sitting around doing nothing but with twit it's basically I you know pick up the the

357
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:37,760
Skype thing on a on a weekly basis. I've already done the work because it's what I do normally and I just sit there and shoot the crap with these

358
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,680
With the other guys who haven't even on the show. It's not like it's not like a job

359
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:48,080
So there's no reason for me not to keep doing it and well, it's it's a whole competitive thing

360
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,400
You know people believe that people don't know what to believe but not at zero sum yet

361
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,320
I mean I don't I don't understand that completely because I'll go although you

362
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,440
We're chiding me earlier. We had for people out there. We had a chat earlier about

363
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,120
Robert Skobel who works for a competitor and

364
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,880
I said I don't think he's ever gonna mention that I'm over here because I don't think this competitor who you if you notice

365
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,280
I'm not saying they're names, but I'll say it pot time tech. Yeah, they are I think they play zero sum which is the you know the game

366
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,400
We're saying well, you know if we say something about them they're gonna take our business away when in fact

367
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
We're not at the point

368
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
in this industry

369
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,360
for any

370
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
for years where

371
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:36,320
You know everything is accumulative in other words if I plug somebody they plug maybe it's not like it's not like for example at pot show

372
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,840
I'll be doing some news drops, but you know

373
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:47,760
Cali does news news kind of and Natalie does news kind of but it's not like any one of us is gonna take any business away from the other

374
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah, because you know and it's not gonna be that way with one company competing with another for maybe ten years

375
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,600
I mean at some point yes

376
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,160
That's gonna happen, but it's not happening now because there's distilled growing what are you gonna do that's gonna be different

377
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,600
John because that's kind of what our great press release says

378
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,640
Yeah, when you hear it you'll see what's different about it

379
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,920
It's gonna be a little it's gonna be a podcast, you know, I've been thinking about this by the way because it's like something you're

380
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,960
Want to know and uh, you know pod I mean just

381
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,400
Reading news is one thing, but having kind of a really just kind of an extreme pod

382
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,800
The pod

383
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,720
Community right now the podcast in community they don't

384
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,280
It's just it's a little more experimental than what you would get from

385
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,720
Standard radio because everything's been coming homogenized and and

386
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,760
Maybe ruin by some of these large corporations that have taken over major media and which is typical in the death throws

387
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Yeah, that's right, but

388
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,200
You know the pod thing is so much

389
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,960
Weirder because you can I mean if you watch like Cali show for example

390
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,920
Geek brief you see

391
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,080
You know, it's it's a very unusual kind of thing that would never be on broadcast TV yet

392
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:07,080
Although that woman who did the rocket boom a man to condon went and actually went to to

393
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,680
Major media. She's like I think she's with ABC now and she does some some podding

394
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,120
Well, isn't she supposed to also be like a segment host for

395
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,600
For one of their cable properties. I don't know what don't they have a case? Yeah, it's something like I mean I've seen but hey

396
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,560
Well, she's got a bunch of jobs. She's supposed to be doing over there, but the fact of the matter is you know

397
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
These major media guys

398
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:39,320
I think are largely clueless about any of it and and so they they're gonna just ruin her the way I see it and

399
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Should we go save her is it worth it?

400
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,760
Well, you know, I think that she would fit in

401
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,880
I mean she's and she's you know, there's a thing I have to say this and I just kind of embarrassing to do this because I

402
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,040
Written for you know

403
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:59,400
wide range of publishing the vehicles as it were and the thing is I used to do some of my best work

404
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
at a low pay

405
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:08,520
Regional distribution publication that was actually free called micro times and it wasn't because it was

406
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,240
You know finally tuned writing that was heavily edited and and made to be super slick

407
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:23,400
It's because nobody cared enough because they were getting me so cheap to say anything about what I was doing and so I would do very

408
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,520
Experimental stuff and it was some of it

409
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:33,000
It's actually holds up. I've reprinted a few things on the one not as much as I showed over at the devorect.org slash blog

410
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,000
Site but I'm going to eventually put some of this stuff up and I you know, I've had I did like

411
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,400
You know scripts. I put us phony scripts up and and strange poems and all kinds of weird stuff

412
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:51,480
They got a lot of play and I always find it the one of the most interesting experiences experiences I had once is that

413
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,000
You do experimental stuff that works and then people who are mainstream

414
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,840
They want you to do that for them and so the situation occurred

415
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,880
I was writing for PC computing which is of you know was a high-end

416
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Prestigious publication at the time and I had sent them a piece

417
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,360
That was because they're always saying why don't you give us more stuff like you're doing over there

418
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,280
And so I sent them an experimental piece that was really an interesting

419
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Kind of a strange dream sequence article and

420
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
They kicked it back which is

421
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,520
It happens once in a while everybody and it's now this is kind of weird. I don't know what we're gonna do

422
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,840
I don't know what can you do is give us a regular column so I get a game a regular thing

423
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,320
And so I gave that dirt that that other piece right to micro times which was the outlet

424
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,800
I was using and they went and told me we love it

425
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:48,520
Well, they they wouldn't say that because they just ran everything but they ran it and the kicker was is that the editor

426
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,840
For PC computing calls me up about the micro times piece and says why don't you give us stuff like that?

427
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,440
Typical so typical so do we get the micro time

428
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,640
Stuff for do we get the the the the PC CIO magazine stuff it depends

429
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,920
I'm gonna give you the micro time stuff

430
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,440
But we'll see what you whether you like it or not, but no you're gonna get some I mean

431
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,120
One of the things I'm gonna be doing over there besides my own material

432
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,520
I'm gonna do that five minute thing and then I'm gonna try to do some some longer pieces that run

433
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,200
On occasion, you know we're getting some other we're gonna get

434
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,400
I'd like to get people out there who are interested in doing tech

435
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,600
Analysis or they want to do podcast

436
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,040
You know, they should definitely check out the pod show sites and

437
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:39,320
Put up something or just get a hold of me or if somebody's doing and I'm actually looking at every

438
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Tech podcast or listening though my guests mostly every tech podcast out there now and there's there's stuff already that that we can bring on

439
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:53,080
To to live and things up. There's a lot of good stuff. There's a lot of good stuff up. There's a lot of crummy stuff

440
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
You know, it's really like going through

441
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,240
Unsolicited manuscripts to find the good stuff, but but it's

442
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,320
There's a lot of stuff. It's amazing. Well, we got reacquainted after

443
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,600
I appeared on cranky geeks and I think we'd probably

444
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Pingly each other back and forth once or twice over over the 15 years

445
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:16,680
Well, you got real you got here's what happened you got some happened with you some years ago

446
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,680
You got really rich and so then you just kind of kicked away everybody else

447
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,720
This happens to anybody makes a lot of money. They they step on everybody under him

448
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Okay, I hope it hurt

449
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,200
I did out my ear is still swollen

450
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,000
Did you ever receive any offers from anyone to do something like this? I mean

451
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I have to believe that there were

452
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,480
Certainly a pod tech or someone must have said you know, do you want a pod tech now no pod tech would never do

453
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,120
There there there I don't think they have the insight

454
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,240
I hate to tell you this Adam, but you know, you're actually in the forefront of this whole thing

455
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,760
not

456
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,520
Give it ask me to do stuff, but just in the whole pod scene

457
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,160
It's it's it's it's but generally scatterbrained right now

458
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,960
I think it's it's has not coalesced in any way shape or format set for about four companies

459
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,840
The other guys are like little mini networks like rev three and these other people who you know

460
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,200
Just produce a lot of little shows that are you know

461
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
Interesting and

462
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:29,080
It's this is I when I got on board with you guys I was thinking to myself this is I'm one of the few times where I'm early in

463
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,520
Because I think that this is the ten years from now

464
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,000
I think almost everything is gonna be done through this

465
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,240
Mechanism I mean you already seeing it the big networks are freaked out about it

466
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,760
They're looking for alternatives or IP TV you know I got kind of jacked up about IP TV

467
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,040
Which by the way, I think is one of the reasons like I jumped on board really fast because I'm all over that

468
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,320
You saw this and you and you've seen our IP TV interface, right?

469
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Yeah a little bit

470
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,160
Wait man, I had a big you haven't seen the whole Chris hasn't given you the whole demo

471
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:05,240
You know, I haven't seen the whole thing because I'm really right now just completely preoccupied with audio

472
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:11,240
Okay, all right, which by the way I have to say I love I really when you when you when you when we first talking and

473
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:16,920
And you know, because you do cranky geeks, which you know, I think has great appeal as the type of program that it is

474
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,960
But I was really happy to hear that you would do audio and daily, which is a big deal. No audio audio is the right now

475
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,640
I don't see anything. I mean the video thing is cool. I agree and I think and I'm a big and like I said

476
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,320
I'm a huge fan of IP TV real IP TV where everything's distributed on the internet. You don't have you don't have antennas anymore

477
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,080
You know like there now there's a new thing called IP

478
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:47,320
B and or some interface or a internet protocol broadcast networks and isn't there a

479
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,600
A couple of companies are trying to pull together and consortium to build an open source and

480
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,720
Open standard IP TV

481
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,400
Spec or platform or something of this name a couple is a bunch of these things showing at mostly by the way

482
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:10,040
Here because the internet actually IP TVs already moving way. I mean they're it's on its way. I have a website

483
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,400
called IP TV daily, which is a scraper

484
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,280
And it I've been up for years and it's like essentially it's a huge database of news stories

485
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,160
And the thing about it is that the number I have

486
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:29,640
Try to put the scraper together for a number of specialist subjects because I need these for my own data for my own purposes

487
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,680
So I you know if I'm going to do it as a website and

488
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,560
The number of stories that come across on a daily basis

489
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,960
It's just astonishing about IP TV in general. You mean yeah, it's just a huge business that's gonna

490
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,440
When it hits it's gonna be a monster and it's gonna be interesting to see what works and you know

491
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,480
We were at see bit and it was all you know like Microsoft

492
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,120
The IP TV platform. I'm my wife is loud

493
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:05,240
The Microsoft IP TV platform and everyone kind of had the same thing and now in you know Motorola's gonna have one and and

494
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,920
Nokia's gonna have one everyone's gonna have their own version of what they call IP TV

495
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:17,400
You know Eric's already got one. I mean go to Sweden and this stuff's already in play it in yours Korea

496
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,440
It's just some of these guys these Johnny come late. These are coming on to the scene with trying to you know

497
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,960
Serpent what's already pretty much in play. I mean if you want to follow a company that's on top of all this look for

498
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Menurve and networks. I mean that's the company that really is a dominant force if I was

499
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:39,560
And if I had any you know money, I didn't invest in them. Hey, John, are you if you don't mind me asking you are a Democrat or Republican

500
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:47,400
I don't like to say, but let me but let me tell you first I started off as a Democrat because I was a kid

501
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:54,200
Right in my parents were you know we're working middle class so then I became a Republican and then it because a Carter

502
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,720
It'd be honest about and the fact that I noticed over the years that all the Democrats kept trying to kill me

503
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,680
So then I became a Republican. I stayed a Republican and now I consider myself an independent because I think the Republicans have just

504
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,680
lost control of their own

505
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:15,560
ideology and so I'm I would consider myself a Republican independent libertarian

506
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,440
Okay, well luckily, I'm just a pothead that makes it much easier to explain. Oh, yeah, that's I can't do that anymore

507
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Oh, you can really for health reasons

508
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,640
No, it's just it's not you know once you get over

509
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,040
24

510
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,040
Fuck you

511
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,760
Only 24 yeah, thanks

512
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,000
John, I'm really well, I've already had fun working with you. I'm really looking forward to

513
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,600
What's coming and working with you? I hope certainly that you when you will remain

514
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,880
Genetic self by being critical of our company and you know what we've already discussed a lot about the site

515
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,960
You know stuff that you know, I can't find anything wrong with the company

516
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,680
I love that you know the funny thing is is that you know the one of the other reasons that you know the company is cool

517
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:11,640
And people that don't realize how big this company actually is but you really have put together a lot of really cool guys

518
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,640
There's a lot of people there. They're all enthusiastic. They're all you know

519
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,800
Reminds me of like you went into magazines once in a while where it's a computer magazine

520
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,520
And there's like people running the magazine that don't like computing

521
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
I'm sorry to God and it's like what are you thinking

522
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,160
And because you know if you work for a week for example you have to know how to fly a plane

523
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,560
Yeah, that would be kind of a good idea

524
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,560
Yeah, because you don't want people writing about aviation and they don't even know how to fly a plane

525
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,080
So that they'd be a night that but you should be an enthusiast which is the cool thing

526
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,520
And that's what you should be with a computer magazine

527
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:49,480
But everybody at Pod Show is an enthusiast to an extreme and most of them have like I mean a lot of these guys

528
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,960
You're talking to them and it's like they got two or three or five

529
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,880
Podcasts that they do themselves on all kinds of weird stuff. It's a pretty pretty amazing group of guys

530
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,640
Yeah, I think well and most people would say is why do you know those people?

531
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,120
And by the way, I shouldn't say guys guys and girls. Oh, yes for sure for sure

532
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,120
I should even say gals, you know, okay

533
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,960
I mean, I live in the Berkeley area. What can I say? I can't have to be careful with my language. That's quite all right

534
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,920
I got I'm fried man. I'm sorry. I just really wanted to talk to you

535
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,640
Because you know the the press release came out and and and and if anyway, you know

536
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,680
I'd love to do some kind of show that is specifically

537
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,920
Hey, Han

538
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,360
I'm interviewing the sabonth there's sabons could you just close my door for a second?

539
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,520
Could you just close my door for a second, please?

540
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,800
Like she slammed it. I don't think she'll screw in

541
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Nicely I thought

542
00:41:52,280 --> 00:42:00,600
Fuck was I gonna say you're talking about your you're glad to see on board. Yeah, exactly. No, but I really am and and I hope you you know continue to

543
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,440
You know to be you and help us with all these other areas and I'd like to be a part of the technology

544
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,080
Potcho tech channel with some kind of show somehow

545
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:16,840
Hey, let's we should do some sort of some talk shows or something. I don't want to you and I just talk and just I don't know that would be like to it

546
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,840
I'm sorry. We can't do that

547
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,360
Actually wouldn't be like to it because the twit no it wouldn't be different because you're different than it would be

548
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,720
Twit and twot is what it would be. They'll be kind of fun. That's watch show the twatch

549
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,680
Okay

550
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,680
Oh

551
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,120
We what we need to what you need get some I don't know. We'll come up with something

552
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,720
I'm sure because there's you know because we have so much time on our hands

553
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:45,160
Well, of course the thing that I hate I hate this with the passion and you know Ron and I were in Germany and kind of had our

554
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,120
Our backstone and everyone and you're right everyone of course is extremely enthusiastic

555
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,080
But you know, so there's like nothing to go to so we have the news is out and you know

556
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,200
There's this press release which is about all we have which of course. It's great someone's thinking we're getting the pieces working together

557
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,680
But you know we haven't you know gotten the you know the the page up yet for a site

558
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,160
You want to tell them tell everyone just what what's gonna happen next and what time frame you think

559
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,240
Yeah, I think next week

560
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,520
We've got the page design. I've got the show kind of figured out

561
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,000
Next week we should start having a show on and unfortunately the U.S. we have a holiday on Monday

562
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,760
We have these holidays once in a while. It's a bank holiday in the UK as well interestingly

563
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,920
You know really what what what what is the holiday there? I don't know it's well

564
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,760
It's strange here, you know, they don't always tell you what the holiday is it's just a bank holiday by the way

565
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,600
And the UK and Canada is boxing day for years and years

566
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,480
I can't say why did they celebrate boxing in those countries for just to take a holiday for boxing?

567
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:50,280
I don't even have that any good boxers. You're kidding me, right, right? You don't really know that

568
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,200
For years. I was thinking they don't get any good boxers in these countries. Why are they celebrating boxing day?

569
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,920
I haven't so such a hard time believing that

570
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,600
And so I find out it's like boxing day for thinking box stuff. I'll be gonna take back

571
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,840
I mean what kind of a holiday is that oh, man

572
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,200
Anyway, yeah, no, that is the day after Christmas here

573
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,560
Right, yeah, so day you take your box stuff up and take it back believe me. So

574
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,120
Anyway, the so we're gonna have a we'll have the thing going. I want people to subscribe to it

575
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:26,680
It is it'd be perfect for the drive the daily drive to work. You'll get the tech news the with you know the

576
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,240
kind with snide comments

577
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,280
Probably I can just say hey

578
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,280
I live we got a new format

579
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,640
It's

580
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,640
What is angry guy?

581
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,640
Tech news snide comments

582
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,360
Yeah, well, there'll be more than that but the

583
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,320
It'll develop to because I'm not gonna you know, I'm gonna

584
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,280
I'm gonna develop the thing so it changes

585
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:54,440
It morphs into whatever people really want it to be but it's gonna be you know, it'll be it'll be valuable for anyone

586
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,920
In fact, I mean we have that the tag line is you know, probably the most important five minutes of your life

587
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,760
I like that. I do like that. It could be

588
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:10,120
The channel concept which I don't want to try even attempt to explain because it's like explaining Tvo and when you just use it

589
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,120
You get it

590
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,280
How are you what are you gonna do with that? I mean what would you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna set up. I'm gonna set up a

591
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,760
Manish of them. I set up five channels. I've been exploring what to put in them

592
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,520
And the channel concept that Potcho which is another reason I thought it would be worthwhile

593
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,200
Working for you guys is really some note of genius in terms of commercializing

594
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,760
the usage of this technology for people who drive you know who use

595
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:43,800
MP3 players or or iPods or whatever and they like to do these RSS downloads with the audio attached

596
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,240
The idea with the channel is that you can take a

597
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,080
A series of shows and wrap them in one RSS feed

598
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,800
So the user can just click on that one thing and then they get this entire

599
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,360
Channel full of material and

600
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,120
Which could be you know two shows ten shows a hundred shows. I mean obviously you don't want that many but

601
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:09,720
You know, I'm thinking in terms of like ten or twenty maybe and what I want to do is I want to set up

602
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,240
Chancellor people who you know they're more a little more specializing just listening to the news

603
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,080
Most of these channels by the way will have my news cast because it seems silly not to

604
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:23,320
But I want to put together like a kind of a light channel of shows that people like to listen to that aren't really you know

605
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,320
They're they're the longer format shows like

606
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:33,240
Your show for example daily source code. Mm-hmm. It's a longer format now light show that people like to listen to it's very entertaining

607
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:41,720
You know it would be geek briefs would be in there probably she might actually get in a couple spots and and and some of these other shows some other vendors

608
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,000
That have useful shows that are long formats

609
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,920
There'd be a kind of just a pure new show that has nothing but just all the new shows stacked up there'd be the one

610
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,360
I'm having the most difficulty with is the IT channel, which is nothing but IT shows literally

611
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,200
Shows done by IT professionals for IT people. There's not going to be the most interesting of the group

612
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:07,960
But I can suspect that people that are in IT that have to commute to work will listen to this thing

613
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,680
Because that's you know, you want to know what the everyone's doing then I want to my favorite one

614
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,920
And now I do a gaming channel and then I would the one that I you know, I think that might some people might kind of get into

615
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:24,280
Is kind of the thorax favorites, which is which is not going to be just computer stuff. It's going to be what I think

616
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,360
You know, there's going to be some there might be a national geographic podcast or maybe

617
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:35,800
Local podcast okay and tucky and but you know, I'd be like my news of course and then may I might have John Madden's

618
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,800
Yeah, of course John Madden's

619
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:45,160
KCBA John Madden's got this great show. He does locally on the radio that they podcasted I think and I would put that in there for sure

620
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,120
Because it's really funny and people who don't like sports by the way

621
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,800
I won't like this channel because I'm kind of a sports nut as you discover when my phone accidentally called you

622
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,640
And I'm driving around when you're listening to that room guy was that what it was?

623
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:03,960
Jim Rome is the best yeah because yeah, you but phone me like three times today and hey, you know what it was I

624
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,000
Sitting on the other thing is bouncing around on the seat and it called you and then you caught me listening to Jim

625
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,200
Rome or one of the other sports talk. It's embarrassing

626
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,440
To the fact that I listen to this stuff

627
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:21,240
But I tell you the truth Jim Rome to me is one of the greatest broadcasters that we've seen in this country for decades

628
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,080
And for a lot of different reasons it's not just because he's he's very entertaining

629
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,640
He has a style that's very distinctive

630
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,640
He has a following. He doesn't you know, you don't seem at Hollywood parties

631
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,880
He just does his own thing. He's got his own little world around him and he does this so well

632
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,120
He's of course making millions of dollars, but

633
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:45,640
It's like really you know when I first turned my thought it was like, who what? Who is this maniac?

634
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,080
This is the weirdest shot I've ever heard because he's actually developed his own language. Is he but he's he's syndicated?

635
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,480
He's on one of those huge radio syndication systems. Okay

636
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,680
John John oh the premier

637
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,040
Radio network is that what it is. Yeah, one day we'll go get him

638
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:09,160
Hey, you know what he needs to be podcasting more because right now they have you could pick up some of his material

639
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,960
But he he charges and it's a it's an awkward situation. It's not the same

640
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:20,120
Yeah, he'd be ideal actually his show is this is just but anyways good drive time stuff for me

641
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:25,480
But although I'm gonna probably get that my card doesn't have that cool connection where you can

642
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,920
Jack in your iPod

643
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:35,640
Yeah, I had a new car. I got a new car. Well now you're working for pod show boy. We got we got a we got a lot three years

644
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,640
I'll be able to get a new car

645
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,600
On on layaway

646
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,520
All right, John man, that was a that was actually a longer chat that I intended but I really appreciated

647
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,840
I'm a talkative guy now, but that's groovy man, so we'll look forward some time next week and

648
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,600
You know anytime we can you know shoot the breeze on on my show

649
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,560
You could do this is a two-parter

650
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,200
Fuck that you know I don't like that

651
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,520
You know you're a dick

652
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,840
Seriously John it's gonna be a lot of fun for sure. All right, I hope to see you out here soon when you get out of

653

654
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:20,600

Devorac

659
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,800
So I hope most of the initial questions were answered

660
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,000
I think it's very interesting to see this response and

661
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,760
So it looks like

662
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,280
Next week everything's gonna start kicking off. All right. I just I have to go to bed. I'm sorry. I just I have no more

663
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,760
Happening to me a moody

664
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,920
Data source code dot com is where you can find uh, it was not a lot of links of course to the the song today. Oh

666
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,520
Thought that discussion between John and I was boring

667
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,360
But I didn't help you completely fall asleep. Try a tyrant opn
