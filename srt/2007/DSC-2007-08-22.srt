Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Fantastic, it's metal curry.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You hoped you'd last but still you'd never known.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Tell me that you think you knew it.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now you feel you need to know it.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You don't know what it is.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Tell me how I need to know it.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I might have thought you'd do the things I say.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're still outside freezing for this anyway.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You'll feel you'll never know it.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Tell me how I need to know it.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're still outside freezing for this anyway.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Tell me that you think you knew it.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Now you feel you need to know it.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You don't know what it is.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Tell me how I need to know it.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Still I know I need to know it.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tell me how I need to know it.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Tell me that you think you knew it.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Now you feel you need to know it.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You don't know what it is.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Tell me how I need to know it.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Fire eggs, a lot of things are using that work.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's over.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Which is pretty much sums it up for the the curry coast vacation.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And kind of the way I was feeling just before getting ready to do this show, which is coming to you from the the Magnum.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you don't know what a Magnum is.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I suggest you go to Google and you check out Dodge Magnum.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It is the the only rental car that was available to us and the one that I picked up in Savio, New York, which we've used today.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
To cruise over to the Roosevelt field mall, which is in Garden City, New York, about 30 foot, about a 40 minute drive from from Savio.

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So we took the ferry 10 o'clock this morning.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I had the whole family.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've got, of course, the lady Patricia and Christina and then my sister willow and her two darling kids.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Sabina and Mateo, Sabina 7 Mateo is a nine years old.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I have to tell you for two kids who have been pretty much stuck inside the beach house looking out at the waves crashing down upon the breakers because of just horrible horrible weather.

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They have been absolutely delightful.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I mean, of course, you know, they've been playing scrabble and thank God for the Disney channel and high school musical too.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Boy, that's a real life saver.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So back to the good old days. Here I am sitting in the car in the parking lot.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've got the window cracked just a little bit. So, you know, just for some basic air to come in.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I've got the car engine running.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm running on battery power. So hopefully, let me just check and see what what I've got left on the old via here one hour and 15 minutes. That should be okay if the time is correct.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I got to tell you, I was pretty down last night yesterday. I was just down in general. You know, of course, the weather wasn't helping.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And when the weather's crap, you know, you figure, well, I'll sit inside. I'll do a little bit of work or maybe I'll prep the show and I think everyone else was inside on the island and was surfing.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In fact, I timed it at 902 AM. That's when I presume everyone's up. The stores that are on the island are open for business and bandwidth goes down to a crunch.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Not just down to a crunch, you know, just to a little drip through a straw, but connections actually breaking. It makes Gmail renders Gmail pretty much useless.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Unless you use the HTML version, even that seems like a long URLs have a real problem in a low slash broken bandwidth environment.

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And I was thinking, you know, I worked 12 hours a day, typically. I'm always trying to find a spot, you know, I need about three hours to do the show an hour worth of prep about 40 minutes to an hour worth of recording and then there's always show notes and uploads and all that stuff.

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And I was like, man, I might as well not do the show at all. It's almost impossible for me to commit to it. And I was feeling really, really down about it. Just like, you know, crap. Why don't I just focus 100% all my energy, all my time on pod show.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And then when, you know, when things let up a little bit and we have enough people installed and can take over some duties for me, then I'll get back to the source code and I was really, really planning on shutting it down for a little while.

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And then I listened to some of the comments that came in today and gosh, I really feel much better.

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I had a money and see where I was listening from Camden and London. It's just coming up to one o'clock in the morning. I'm just outside work, lean it.

67
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm really satisfied on a PhD student and I've just finished literally four years' worth of practical work like PhDs or where it becomes a lab again.

68
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I'm the nurse to you. You've been my constant lab buddy for the past years since I started podcasting.

69
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And since you've been around the this time, I thought since you've been around with me with a daily source code that you should probably know that I finished my practical work.

70
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Thanks very much for the show. I'll keep listening.

71
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You know, so first of all, congratulations on finishing the PhD and, you know, you hear stuff like that and there's a whole bunch of other comments that came in and like, wow, there's a lot more going on.

72
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There's a lot more of a relationship between me and you guys out there listening and it would be, it almost be like breaking up with your favorite girlfriend, you know.

73
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So, thank you. That call, that particular call really made a difference it really did.

74
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I just so you know, the setup. I've got my a via my Sony via running cast blaster, of course. I've got the the wireless microphone pair set up. I've got my headphones on.

75
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You know, people are driving by here in the parking lot looking at me like, what is that fool doing?

76
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Roosevelt Field Mall. Roosevelt Field Mall. Roosevelt Field actually, a very important aviation history. This is the, when it was still a field before they erected this humongoid structure.

77
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It, a lot of famous flights were made here. Probably the most famous was Charles Limberg who took off from here to arrive in Paris, like 33 or 33 and a half hours later.

78
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And yeah, it's kind of interesting to be sitting on, I guess, what formerly were the fields knowing that this was a place of such historic importance in an aviation history.

79
00:08:43,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I got just tons and tons of comments I want to get to. This is one that I'm very proud of. This is from Blake Morgan. Now, I played, by the way, had I known that the Blake was going to call in. I probably would have, would have downloaded maybe I'm amazed.

80
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Maybe I'm amazed again, because it's such an awesome version of the Paul McCartney classic Blake called in and just really gave me some very exciting news, which is all a part of the pot safe music network and the platform and the revolution that we're all building together here. Listen to Blake.

81
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Adam Curry, daily source code. This is Blake Morgan from New York, Colin in. So your spin of maybe I'm amazed on Tuesday has changed everything here with our release of this record.

82
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And what we're doing at the label on a personal note, first of all, again, you're, I shot you an email about this, but you're, you're call out at the end of the, at the end of the song and something I will never forget. And it's going to be my press kit forever, but much more importantly, the reaction out in the actual world was unbelievable. We had such a humongous bump on iTunes that we're still trying to pick up the pieces.

83
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Maybe I'm amazed has become the most successful download in engine company record history. It's the single most downloaded song of my career and briefly it topped iTunes on Tuesday after your show.

84
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And what's more is that it's carried through for the remainder, you know, for the last couple days, if you go to iTunes and you go to my page, Blake Morgan on the page and you look at my top songs, you're going to see a gigantic bar across the screen.

85
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:32,000
For maybe I'm amazed and these tiny little, tiny little bars next to it for all the other songs, which is just put, you know, the massive amount of downloads that we've gotten for that song in comparison to everything else.

86
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I did National Radio on Friday, National Syndicated Radio Show, the Lisa Bermback Show, she was terrific, I was on for half an hour and we got absolutely nothing close to the bump that we got from you spinning that song once on your show.

87
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Anyone who thinks that podcasting is not beating out to restroom radio is insane because it absolutely is certainly in this case.

88
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And what's more is that today on e-music, which is the second biggest music retailer in the world, five of the top 20 albums are albums from our record label.

89
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
My record that may be on May is on and four others, we have five albums in the top 20 and they have a catalog of 20,000 records.

90
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So we are kicking ass and you have led the charge and really changed the nature of what this release is like.

91
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So I'm here to say thank you and again, if anybody doesn't think that shows like yours and what you're doing and what PMN is doing is really the way of the future and make a different certain thing because it really is.

92
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So thank you and so glad you dug the track and I hope to talk to you soon man.

93
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Be well.

94
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Alright, Blake Morgan, everybody.

95
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
They, wow, big difference when the mic cracks, huh?

96
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, first of all, I'd like to take thanks for it, but I can't really, I mean, this is the work of thousands of people and of course, thousands of daily source code listeners who were tuned in, you know?

97
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And I think that we are at several tipping points where it's some form of critical mass that's taking place where indeed it makes a lot more sense for you to start your own label to record your own stuff.

98
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Do it at your house, do it on pro tools, get it out there, release it, get the CD on e-muse it or CD baby and put your tracks on iTunes and and then promote it.

99
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
There are many different avenues, podcasts, music network being one of them and all these independent shows.

100
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's phenomenal, it really, really is and I obviously couldn't be more proud of what has happened and encourage anyone who is thinking of doing something in music to check out the different options that are available.

101
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I actually have asked Blake and he's a real busy guy, I've asked him if he could put together some kind of like a small video clip or something.

102
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We're going to produce it, I've asked Mark Yoshimo to help out with that, you know, for him to put together maybe just like a three to five minute blurb that'll be on the podcast music network that shows people.

103
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What steps you need to take to really do something independently, it's not just putting your music on the podcast music network obviously there's a lot more that goes along with that and there's a lot of things that you can do and a lot of them very cheaply if not for free.

104
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So look for that very soon, God, I'm so happy about that and the next show I'm going to play the track again because it's just an awesome awesome version.

105
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So one more day on fire island which besides the weather has been quite delightful.

106
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The vibe is nice, all the people on the island are nice, it's you know it's just in general it's it's really really been nice and well there's some some history to it.

107
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I think I've discussed most of it, but if not here's a here's another call about it.

108
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Hey Adam it's burning, I'm listening to your chat about fire island and it is a beautiful place but a little bit about the unusual history behind it for a long time in the 70s and the 80s and I'm not sure whether it continued on into the 90s.

109
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But fire island was considered to be a gay highway and all of the beaches were predominantly gay beaches so it was that kind of a place.

110
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Doesn't mean it wasn't beautiful but it certainly does have an interesting history beyond the more ancient but the more recent is also of note.

111
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm not sure how it is now I'd be curious to hear if you noted anything like that when you were there or whether that history is behind it.

112
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I hope you had a good trip to New York, I'm sorry that I didn't get a chance to hook up with you but maybe the next time you're here, talk to you later.

113
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll definitely be in New York again soon, you can count on that and for those of you who know of the TV program Little Britain.

114
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There's this great sketch where there's this guy called David and he says I am the only gay in the village, well guess what we are the only non-gays in the village.

115
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't know if it's considered a highway but I think the community there is pretty much 90% gay lesbian and whatever else you can think of in those categories and of course that doesn't make any difference to us.

116
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Actually, if anything, it makes it really nice because everyone's just so friendly.

117
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No one's worried about what people think about you, what you look like the dress code is completely casual, you can go into.

118
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There are a couple of actually I think there's two nice restaurants and you can walk in there and you're in your trunks if you want in your swimming trunks.

119
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The clothing appears to be pretty much optional on the beaches, although you definitely want to wear something with the weather the way it is.

120
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But it's great and I have a feeling that it being a gay hideaway is probably been that way for a long time.

121
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
In case in point, we have proof that PW Fenden was here in 1972.

122
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Come to podcasting.

123
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Don't be alarmed or negro.

124
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Two guys in a mic.

125
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What's happening in the world? You all are not ready.

126
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
A little bit of sports, a little bit of entertainment, a little bit of comedy, a little bit of seriousness.

127
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And you got two guys in a mic.

128
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
EFP and page two.

129
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Senior writer, Elsie Granis and thanks for joining.

130
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Hey, thanks guys for having me.

131
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I think I was on the idea of that.

132
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You know, friendship is a two-way street.

133
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And just as you want with the fear of friendship friends, you want what's best for you.

134
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Right.

135
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's true.

136
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You know, but you're making a very, have a fit in my collar.

137
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You're making a very intelligent and logical decision in a problem that's within the heart.

138
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Two guys in a mic.

139
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If you were driving under the influence, you need to snatch your hands off the road.

140
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't want you running into me killing me or killing my family.

141
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And that rant was brought to you by me.

142
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I got to say one thing.

143
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That's pretty what man loves the show.

144
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Really cool show.

145
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll definitely turn in again.

146
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's two guys in a mic.

147
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Every Tuesday, eight o'clock Eastern on TalkShoot.com.

148
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You know, I got to find out.

149
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That sounded like a combination of Mark Yoshimuna and M.Coff

150
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and Tony Price from Costas World.

151
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I quite sure I definitely got to check that one out.

152
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You know, of all the comments that come in,

153
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and I screen every single one of them.

154
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
There's only one person that I will play unconditionally,

155
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
without even having listened to the comment as I have not done with this one.

156
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's just titled Korea.

157
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It could only be from the one and only.

158
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Comics trip.

159
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Comics trip.

160
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Comics trip.

161
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Comics trip.

162
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Comics trip.

163
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Comics trip.

164
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Comics trip.

165
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Comics trip.

166
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Comics trip.

167
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Comics trip.

168
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
How the Adam Kerry.

169
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Here is your Polish friend, CSP.

170
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Adam.

171
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I have a question for your Uncle Dunn.

172
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I remember a story about Grandmother,

173
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
that one Korean friend, Talk nuance.

174
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
She was taken to Japan by Japanese and violated.

175
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
My question.

176
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Is it true that hatred towards Japanese steel is ripe

177
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
in both Korea's North and South?

178
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You're all.

179
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
All right, CSB.

180
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Well, as you know, I'm still working on how exactly we're going to capture Uncle Dunn's story telling.

181
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is a question I can ask in regardless,

182
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
so I'll be talking to him next week,

183
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and I'll ask him.

184
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I have no idea.

185
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And of course, I think times have probably changed.

186
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So it may not be that way anymore.

187
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
If you've been following Curry dot com,

188
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
you probably saw I posted,

189
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
well, from time to time,

190
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
we'll just post channels that people are making with our,

191
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
with cheddar, our channel editor,

192
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
which is now a feature that is available to every single,

193
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
account on potshot.com.

194
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, man, wait until you see the new dashboard

195
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and the stuff that's coming,

196
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
which I don't know if we're going to have one big like switch.

197
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I think we'll be rolling pieces out

198
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
bit by bit,

199
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
but some of them will be pretty drastic,

200
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and I think we've leaked a lot of the,

201
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
a lot of the nagging bits of confusing interface, etc.

202
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I found a great channel,

203
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
which I think actually it popped up.

204
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
How did I find that?

205
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I might have found it through one of my ego filters

206
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
or like a filter for pod show or something.

207
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
For fantasy football,

208
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
which is a great,

209
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
a great channel to follow along with,

210
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
particularly now the football season

211
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
has just begun or about to begin.

212
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And well, the guy who built the channel sent in a comment.

213
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This is Mark,

214
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and this is John,

215
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
from Pixkin Radio.

216
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We put together a fantasy football channel on pod show.

217
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's right,

218
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
it's a collection of quality fantasy football podcasts,

219
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
along with our show,

220
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
a weekly injection of fantasy smack

221
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
to feed your addiction.

222
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That's right,

223
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
so get on over to

224
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Pixkin.potshow.com

225
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
to add the channel to your iTunes

226
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
or pod catcher in joy.

227
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah,

228
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and there you go,

229
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
a promo for a channel.

230
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It can't get much more nuttyer,

231
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
but I think it will,

232
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and as we improve on the channel editor,

233
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
by the way,

234
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
an idea there is to,

235
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
to put a single episode,

236
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
like an intro or something at the,

237
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
at the front of the channel,

238
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
so whenever someone gets it for the first time,

239
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
or whenever they get it,

240
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
or whenever they refresh it,

241
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
basically,

242
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
they'll get your new intro to the channel.

243
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
There's a lot more that we can do

244
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to help people package this,

245
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
and of course,

246
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
widgets on the other end,

247
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
so you can put it on your page,

248
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
anywhere you want to,

249
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and your Facebook,

250
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
or your MySpace,

251
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and I'm very,

252
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
very excited about that,

253
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and really happy to see that this thing

254
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
is gaining traction,

255
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
because it's,

256
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
well,

257
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
it's what I had hoped for,

258
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and it's really changing the way

259
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
that people are using RSS,

260
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and without even knowing that they're using RSS,

261
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and mashing stuff together,

262
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
coming up with,

263
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
with entertainment.

264
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It really is.

265
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You don't even have to,

266
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
create a show to,

267
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
to entertain,

268
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
just put together a channel of great stuff.

269
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's a fantastic way for other people

270
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
to find programming,

271
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and when we start putting our connections together,

272
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
you'll see that it's really awesome

273
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
when you,

274
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
when you find a channel,

275
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
see who else is subscribed to that channel,

276
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
what other shows they have,

277
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
a really reminiscent of the old Napster.

278
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Remember when you could go into someone's hard drive,

279
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and look at all those songs they had,

280
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
after finding one song,

281
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
you could just say,

282
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
oh, let me see what else this guy,

283
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
or gal has,

284
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
that's the kind of,

285
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
the kind of social network that,

286
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
that we've envisioned,

287
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and it really,

288
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
really is starting to come true.

289
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
All right,

290
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
let me see,

291
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I got so much stuff to get through,

292
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
let's play this one real quick.

293
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Right,

294
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
my name is TQ White.

295
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I think that regarding the eye player issue,

296
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
you got it exactly wrong.

297
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The fact that it's a peer-to-peer application,

298
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
makes the net neutrality consequences,

299
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
even worse.

300
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
All right, let me just set this up for a second.

301
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I was talking about the BBC eye player,

302
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
when you actually install it,

303
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
it installs peer-to-peer software,

304
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
which you cannot turn off,

305
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
called Kentucky.

306
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So essentially,

307
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
your machine,

308
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
whenever it's connected to the network,

309
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
whether you like it or not,

310
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
is a part of the infrastructure

311
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
that the BBC is put in place,

312
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
so they don't have to pay for bandwidth.

313
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And I don't really have that much of a problem with it,

314
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
but,

315
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
well,

316
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
listen to the rest of the comment,

317
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
and I'll tell you why I think peer-to-peer is a virus,

318
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and why it is a problem,

319
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and why it has nothing to do with net neutrality,

320
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
rather with that PR,

321
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
bad marketing,

322
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and the infrastructure.

323
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Here's what's going on.

324
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
People pay for their bandwidth,

325
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
to their home computer.

326
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They are supposed to be allowed to use that bandwidth

327
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
for whatever the X they want.

328
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
If they choose to use it for a peer-to-peer application,

329
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
so be it.

330
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's what they want to do.

331
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
In my estimation,

332
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
the net neutrality concept says

333
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
that we do not want the faceless bureaucrats

334
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
in the internet service provider organizations

335
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
to be deciding how we use our network bandwidth

336
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
that we pay for.

337
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Okay, I just got to stop you there for a second.

338
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Okay, so here's the problem.

339
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The problem is, of course,

340
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
that the ISPs,

341
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
the people who deliver internet to your home,

342
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
never, ever in a million years,

343
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
never thought that this would happen.

344
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
They would just think, in fact,

345
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
it's called ADSL, a synchronous digital subscriber line

346
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
because you get just a little bit of upstream

347
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and much more downstream

348
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
because they're thinking,

349
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
well, people are going to consume.

350
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
No one ever thought about people producing

351
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and serving stuff and sending stuff up the pipe,

352
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and they also never really figured

353
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
that you might be consuming 24-7.

354
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Like, okay, I'll click on a page, the page comes in.

355
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And of course,

356
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
there's a lot of shared resources on these networks,

357
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and the entire internet is based on overselling

358
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
the pipes that they have available.

359
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So there's a lot less bandwidth

360
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
than they're selling,

361
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
because they never expected

362
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
for these types of protocols to be put into place.

363
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So, of course, if they had said this 10 years ago,

364
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
or maybe, yeah, about 10 years ago

365
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
when broadband started to proliferate

366
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and say, well, you can't do this, you can't do that.

367
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It would have been a very different story,

368
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
but they never did,

369
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and they can't back out of that now.

370
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But when it comes to the resources of the network,

371
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
if everyone is using their network connection that way,

372
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
then it'll bring the entire network down,

373
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
or at least that segment.

374
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That's just a physical fact I would say.

375
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So, it has nothing to do with net neutrality.

376
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It only has to do with net neutrality.

377
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It only has to do with the fact that they cannot sustain their network.

378
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So, I think we're going to be looking

379
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
at an upgrade there for the ISPs,

380
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and of course, as a whole backstory to that,

381
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
that the telco has got all this money,

382
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and they should have been spending it

383
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
on building out their infrastructure,

384
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
which they probably didn't.

385
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
They probably spent it on a whole bunch of hogwash marketing,

386
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and which is a shame,

387
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
because, you know, as I said on curie.com,

388
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
my blog, you know,

389
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I think the broadband in the States

390
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
is really pretty lame compared to,

391
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
certainly compared to the experiences I've had in Europe,

392
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
whiteness the mesh network on Fire Island.

393
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And again, that's just the oversaturation of the network.

394
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So, it's not about net neutrality, it's about lying.

395
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's about lying that they have this fantastic network,

396
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
and all this bandwidth that you can consume,

397
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and they really don't have it.

398
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
They've oversold you.

399
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So, I'm down with you on that.

400
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Unfortunately, I just don't buy the net neutrality part.

401
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
All they're trying to do is trying to,

402
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
basically make their network usable for everybody,

403
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and if you've got a whole bunch of peer-to-peer applications running,

404
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
running continuously, that's a problem for them.

405
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So, it's a different fight, okay?

406
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's not about them determining what content you can,

407
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
or you can't see.

408
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And by the way, a lot of the peer-to-peer stuff,

409
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
of course, it's illegal.

410
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We'll just say that the BBC stuff is not illegal,

411
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
but that's really what the problem boils down to.

412
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I don't think it's about net neutrality.

413
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Let's see what else you have to say in this comment.

414
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The idea that they want the BBC to pay for this bandwidth

415
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
is doubly silly, because the BBC isn't doing it.

416
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I suppose that you could imagine,

417
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
you could say that the peer-to-peer applications

418
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
are sort of a virus to the extent that

419
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
an application that gets into someone else's head,

420
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
that they want to use that causes them to behave in a way

421
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
that is beneficial to the BBC,

422
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
is a valid way to look at it.

423
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
However, what you've got here is people that are paying for bandwidth

424
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
that are using it the way they want to,

425
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
and the internet service provider is saying,

426
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
hey, well, you happen to be benefiting the BBC,

427
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
so they gotta pay.

428
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
In fact, I believe that that's wrong.

429
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Hope you're having a good day.

430
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'd like your vacation.

431
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Nice podcast.

432
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Good luck with your company.

433
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Bye-bye.

434
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I think I appreciate it.

435
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So I believe me.

436
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm definitely against the man.

437
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's just there's a lot of confusion about what net neutrality

438
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
is really supposedly about or is supposed to be about.

439
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And I just don't think this is the issue.

440
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
This is about them.

441
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Just not having the resources to,

442
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
you know, they've sold you a bag of goods, essentially.

443
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So I'd call it false advertising before I call it a net neutrality issue.

444
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Let's roll another promo here.

445
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Hey, you.

446
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Do me a favor.

447
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Go over to your radio, flip it on,

448
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and tell me what you hear.

449
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
The same old crap, right?

450
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
But what did you expect?

451
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Wait a minute.

452
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Let's take the test right now.

453
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Okay.

454
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Actually, that wasn't too bad.

455
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'd get a little bit of chocolate cognate, no body.

456
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So let's scan the dial here.

457
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Nothing.

458
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
What?

459
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It was real.

460
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What?

461
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Trying to find the speakers.

462
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay, that's boring.

463
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
What's this?

464
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Z100 boring.

465
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
boring.

466
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
boring.

467
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Okay.

468
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah, you're right, same old crap.

469
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That's where podcasting comes in.

470
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Look, there's hundreds of thousands of podcasts out there,

471
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
and thousands of music podcasts as well.

472
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm but one of them.

473
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
What do you think I'm doing this promo?

474
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm Potcia Radio.

475
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I feature one artist per show.

476
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You're going to hear some music.

477
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You're going to hear the background of the band.

478
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You're going to find out where you can buy their cities

479
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and where you can see them live.

480
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So, after you listen to all the other podcasts,

481
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
give me a try.

482
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
My name's Brent,

483
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and you can find me over at PotciaRadio.com.

484
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
That ground music provided by the band,

485
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
46 Bliss.

486
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I love it when people use podcasts,

487
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
music and promos,

488
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and credit them in the promo,

489
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
which actually melds right into this next question.

490
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah, this is Chris and Philadelphia.

491
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You may not know,

492
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
but I'm a digital artist.

493
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm working on some video stuff.

494
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I've always been visual person making art in Photoshop.

495
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's very quiet.

496
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
There's no audio.

497
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And now I get up in video.

498
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I need some music in there.

499
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I have a question about the licensing for Pod State music.

500
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If I call my art a show and produce it

501
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and report it as such on the Pod State music network,

502
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
can I make a video that includes a soundtrack

503
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
that is Pod State?

504
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Is that something I can do just download

505
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
from the Pod State music network?

506
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Or do I have to work out something

507
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
individually with the artists

508
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
which I'm sure would be not too hard either

509
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
because it's on the piano.

510
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's a quick question.

511
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Hopefully you can answer on a show or something like this.

512
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
All right, ma'am.

513
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So the short answer is yes.

514
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Of course, that's a valid use of Pod State music.

515
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
There's a little bit of a longer answer to it.

516
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I need to know a bit more about what you're doing.

517
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But yeah, you're certainly allowed to do that.

518
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Of course, you do have to credit the artist

519
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
in that piece of work and report it back

520
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
to the network.

521
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Please, everybody continue to report your plays

522
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
back to the network.

523
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's very, very important for the artists

524
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
who are making their art available.

525
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So yeah, it's what we call, I think,

526
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
a derivative work, just call it a mashup.

527
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Now, how you use it is where you're probably

528
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
your safest bet is to contact the artist.

529
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
For instance, if you were to sell these

530
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and duplicate these, there could be some issues there.

531
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So it's always a safe bet just to contact the artist

532
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
if you want to do something like something of that nature.

533
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But the whole point is you should be able to use

534
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
music for a show regardless of what it is.

535
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
If it's a video show or if it's pictures

536
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
that you've done would like Ken's burns effect

537
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
or if it's in enhanced podcasts,

538
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
it's all kind of multiple sides of the same coin.

539
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
So should not be a problem, but it's always nice

540
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
to reach out to the artist and let them know

541
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
what you're doing with it.

542
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And who knows, maybe there's more you can do with that artist.

543
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
That's how great connections are made.

544
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It's a really up-point-cost,

545
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
it's like a custom on technique,

546
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
but it's not scared.

547
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's a weird point,

548
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I like a point,

549
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
net-sniz-tek-gest-reck-cost.

550
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:44,000
No, you should know it.

551
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Do you see 654?

552
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I should have played that one at the beginning of the show,

553
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Gustav.

554
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'd have a 10-email thread with Gustav.

555
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
He's from Sweden,

556
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and he sent me a message saying,

557
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
hey man, I want to do a show.

558
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
What software are you using?

559
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I put it into cast blaster,

560
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and then he said, oh, this is fantastic.

561
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'll let you know what I've my show up and running.

562
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And I said, I sent me a promo.

563
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
He said, in Swedish, I said, well, yeah, of course.

564
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Why not?

565
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I didn't understand one word of it,

566
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
but yeah, absolutely.

567
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Now, from Sweden to home with the Beatles.

568
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Hello, Adam.

569
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's a call on my beautiful England long time list

570
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
that's from the days when you came in from Belgium,

571
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and moved to Gilford, fabulous show.

572
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Love it, listen to it all the time at the essay.

573
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Just thought that it'd be something maybe

574
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
of interest to you.

575
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I was on the scope of a show website,

576
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and he demonstrated a new application

577
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
to me called the VOD, the EODIA.com,

578
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
which allows you to do a live broadcast,

579
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
a live video broadcast on your laptop,

580
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
which then archives as well.

581
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Which I thought will be great for you.

582
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You know, will be great for us as listeners.

583
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So we're able to see you, perhaps,

584
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
through a part of the show.

585
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You can schedule it so we can all watch it a certain time,

586
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and then we can watch the archive, if we miss it.

587
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
If you go to www.VODIA.com,

588
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
you'll give it to say,

589
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
well, it's all about.

590
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I've used it on my blog,

591
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
which is the virtual travelcast.com.

592
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Just thought it'd be good,

593
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and I would really like to see you doing something like that.

594
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Anyway, thanks for the show.

595
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I really enjoyed the folder.

596
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I can't imagine what a sponge it does to be honest with you.

597
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Sorry.

598
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah, man, great.

599
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah.

600
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
No, if only I had time to figure all that stuff out

601
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and set that up.

602
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
One day, one day, we'll get that on some kind of schedule.

603
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Something else I was going to say,

604
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and then I felt my iPhone vibrate in my pocket,

605
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
someone's trying to get a hold of me.

606
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
God knows what that's all about.

607
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
See, I was talking about, no, I don't remember.

608
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It's completely gone.

609
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'll tell you what.

610
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I've got about 17, not about.

611
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I have exactly 17 minutes of battery power left,

612
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
so I can play one more song, say goodbye,

613
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and then if I run inside into the mall next to the Apple store,

614
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
where there's a fantastic leather couch,

615
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
just by the way, big up, big props to Apple

616
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
for having a humongous bandwidth available on Open Wi-Fi.

617
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Here at Roosevelt Field Mall,

618
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
really, really appreciate that's Devo.

619
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
That's fantastic.

620
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
That's the way it should be, man.

621
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I really, really love that.

622
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So then I'll be able to upload.

623
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Well, then it's back to fire on one more night.

624
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
We got some sun predicted for tomorrow

625
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and tomorrow evening we fly back to the UK.

626
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So I'm going to leave you with a band from just around the corner,

627
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
more or less, from Connecticut,

628
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
they're called Echoing August.

629
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I think you'll like this.

630
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's got a couple of good plays on the pot,

631
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
it's a music network.

632
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm looking at the pot blazing here.

633
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's titled, The Song From Yesterday,

634
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
on Your Journey.

635
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
What should I say to Chuck?

636
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
They had a source coming.

637
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I dealt this year.

638
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And you know that I'll be there.

639
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I want to go there.

640
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm as lucky as being there.

641
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I want to know that if you feel the same.

642
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And you know that I'll be there.

643
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
But looking back on what I said before now,

644
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I'll take my chances.

645
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It's not my problem at all.

646
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It's my pride fighting for it.

647
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
No, no, no.

648
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's just a beautiful day before.

649
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You did not know what I'm about.

650
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Still isn't your head no doubt.

651
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Can't believe that I have still around.

652
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Where you come and like time and kiss on the back of the floor.

653
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Like tons and tons with it before.

654
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And you know that I'll be there.

655
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
But looking back on what I said before now,

656
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'll take my chances.

657
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's not my problem at all.

658
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It's just my pride fighting for it.

659
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You did not know what I'm about.

660
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Still isn't your head no doubt.

661
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Can't believe that I have still around.

662
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:57,000
But looking back on what I said before now,

663
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'll take my chances.

664
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's not my problem at all.

665
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's my pride fighting for it.

666
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
No, no, no.

667
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It's just a beautiful day before.

668
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You did not know what I'm about.

669
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Still isn't your head no doubt.

Still isn't your head no doubt.

694
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,360
Well from the timer here on cast blaster, I

695
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,000
thought that song was going to last about a minute and a half longer.

696
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Apparently it's the longest fade out in history,

697
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
but just about perfect, to hit our 40 minute mark for this daily source code episode number

698
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
604.

699
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
With some luck, y'know I might record one on the

700
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
plane home.

701
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
We've got time tomorrow, I'll see what

702
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,980
Of course Friday over the weekend next week is going to be absolutely chocolate block in London with with meetings

703
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,040
But I guess I'm just going to have to resort back to a little bit of the older format

704
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,420
And just record wherever I can and do whatever I can bringing you the true meaning of source code

705
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,420
Just the crap that's running around in my brain
