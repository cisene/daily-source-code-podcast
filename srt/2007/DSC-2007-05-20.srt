Me, I think not so much.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Here, here.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
One tram on Fred.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I shall kick your arms.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But get these two on trivia games show.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Bone and watch the fetters fly.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, I think since he was into pain, it's probably dentist.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's go with the meta couple.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, that's gonna leave a mark.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Tell you how to pivot on here.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, this for Todd. We're rolling. Go ahead anytime.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Where's my drink?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hello.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Mark.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Adam?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Are you okay?

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Mark, I don't feel well.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you need to go to the hospital or anything?

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No hospital.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll just rest on the couch.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Dude, you think you should call a doctor?

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It happens all the time.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hey, is there anything you need a water?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
A blanket?

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A fat split.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can't roll you a joint right now.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What are you on anyway?

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
More fun with the demoral chaser.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mark, I'm so broke.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't know what I'm going to do.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Um, you have a 16 million dollar airplane.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I know.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I just told it for three bags of weed.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What? What the hell are you thinking?

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I was so high.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Where are you right now?

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I think I'm on the highway.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And I think I smell poop.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Dude, that is foul.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I hope it's not mine.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Come to think if I hope it is mine.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Adam, you got to get home.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Come.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I have no home.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm haunted.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This biased.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Leaving like an animal.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The jungle is my home.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But I feel sure the world that I can be it's master.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I shall perfect my own race of podcasts.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
A race of atomic superpodcasters.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's for a comfortable world.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, then.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Good luck with all that.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hey, listen, before I go,

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I want to ask you about the blackberries you were going to get this stuff.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You know, I want to know if I could get a sidekick instead that said

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Nemkoff.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Nemkoff.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Sidekick.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Fuck you.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Nemkoff doesn't deserve the smell.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
My shit.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, so blackberry is then.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, anyway.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This has been fun.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You know, I got some things to do.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Uh, so I'll catch you later, Adam.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So I'll bring up Nemkoff.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You think it takes talent to do BCH?

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No, it's all makeup and cursing.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Count this in a slat.

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're listening to the daily source code with Mark Yoshimoto-Namkoff.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I got it.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I got it.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Starts like a whirlwind.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Thinking about your girlfriend.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Making lots of time.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And you've been down there.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You've been on a ride a song.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Been working on it long.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And so we get mix it down.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You can't be free.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But then you come to learn from the man.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He was to slap a little steak on your plan.

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Just be little words.

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't you know it to work anymore.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We want it to be like we want it to.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We want it to be like we want it to.

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We want it to be like we want it to.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We want it to be like we see.

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We want it to be like we see.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And you can't lock it down.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can never put it down.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Shout it out.

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's never music free.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've got it in my pocket.

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I've even went and bought it.

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I didn't steal it.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, I never would.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I said don't make it look like.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Just another crew.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Because I'm doing what you said that I should do.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So take a deep breath now my friend.

We want it to.

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We want it to live like we see.

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That you can't lock it down.

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You can never put it down.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Shout it out.

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's never music free.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We like it to see you.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
To anything yet,

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
To anything unless we all stand up.

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We want it to die.

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And it's not that not as nobody around.

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Everybody's not enough.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No.

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's the way it's gonna be

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We want to tune like we want to

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Break it while we want to

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Break it up so everyone can see

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let your can't lock it down

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If you've never put it down

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We shot it out and set the music free

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We want to tune like we want to

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Break it while we want to

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Bring it up so everyone can see

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let your can't lock it down

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If you've never put it down

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We shot it out and set the music free

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Set the music free

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Jeff Smith set the music free

156
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The Jeff Smith saying fuck you DRM

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I love it and you can get that song at music.podshow.com

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hey everybody welcome to the daily source code episode 5-8-5

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And yes it is for 20

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You know what that means

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You know what that means Mike right

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I do know what that means

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Actually I'll talk to college

164
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Mike and I we are very glad

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
To be back in LA

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The bangers and mash thing I was confused about how that works

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, I can't tell you why Mike and I had to leave London so quickly

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But it involves a duck queen Elizabeth and the jar of gasoline and a spatula

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And I think it was a spatula through it over the top

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, that was that was a little too far

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah, but I'll tell you that that queen

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You you saucy minks you she's a gamer she is and the carpet does match the drapes

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I mean you know in the living room

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You know they're very cultured people

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What did what do you think I meant?

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Did you think I meant that dirt

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
No because it doesn't match the because she shapes so it totally doesn't match

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's the spatula it's the spatula exactly so

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Who who knew who knew you know you drive on the left hand side the road and you would

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Who wow whatever

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't know but

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You know at the airport though when we landed on on our flight

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You saw the right who was in first class it was that actor

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,400
That the one that you look like she she'll a buff the buff the beef right

186
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,800
Like a buff yeah, yes, yes, he was there and

187
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,800
Yeah, he was he was like hanging out and I got it. He was wearing some really tight pants

188
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,680
And

189
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,680
Go ahead

190
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,000
I was gonna say I was not impressed now. I was not impressed either and and the funny thing is that

191
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I realized that

192
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,040
His name Trent the way you translate isn't she yeah actually is the is um

193
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,880
Well it means oh where where where is

194
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,680
She'll a buff so means is and name actually translates to where's the beef

195
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:48,200
It's obviously not in his pants, but that's a whole other story exactly so yeah check the flicker pin

196
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Exactly so

197
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,640
You know, I wanted actually I want to read this email right up right off the bat. So Charlie Row

198
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,200
Sent in this one he says I love that the pale wookie

199
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,200
Give you his show while he's on vacation the pale wookie

200
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,920
I just thought and he said I thought I'd give you an update on what's happened since the Christmas contest well, you know

201
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,160
Charles Rivera is the guy that basically won the

202
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,640
You know we put an episode of PCH host an episode

203
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
Basically it wasn't really an episode of PCH, but

204
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,360
Get into our time slot on serious be a series DJ for a day and we put it up for auction

205
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,320
All proceeds going to the David Foster Foundation

206
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,600
So we put that up around the holiday season and

207
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Charles A he basically

208
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,680
Charles A rovere I'm wondering why he calls himself Charles A so I'll just come Charlie Row Chuckie Row

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,680
So Chuckie Row

210
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,680
one and

211
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,680
you know, he was

212
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,120
We put him up on serious in the serious slot and he said I thought he'd give you an update on what's happened since the Christmas contest

213
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:09,080
MSB podcast.com is now a multi national multi linguistic phenomenon since I found another MSR and Amsterdam now

214
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,960
It's a podcast now he's a podcaster with MS

215
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,880
Which is to me. I think is pretty amazing because

216
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,280
You know he's got MS. I mean he's got a monkey scrote him and

217
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,760
Not a lot of people can podcast with a monkey scrote him and

218
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,880
It's hard to still that long. Oh wait a second. You know what this is a different MS. I'm sorry. No, no, I'm

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,600
I'm thinking of the of Jersey Todd's MS. This is no he's got multiple sclerosis

220
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,800
So he he actually started out with one sclerosis and he invested heavily

221
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,000
In sclerosis and now he's multiple. Yeah, he has he's the Donald Trump of sclerosis now

222
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Wow and so he said

223
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,760
So he's got the MSB podcast.com which is not about MS. He just plays a lot of great tunes and stuff

224
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:04,440
He says because of the focus of my cast it was possible for me to get her to start her own podcast and for me to provide the wire

225
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
I can tell you that's a freaking thrill

226
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,400
You give up control, but you get back so much in return

227
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:15,880
So I'm Charles A from the MSB podcast.com. So see see how it worked out. That's awesome. I'm so happy

228
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,360
But I see it's touching the masses

229
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,960
Exactly in it again in an appropriate way this time

230
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Exactly, yeah

231
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,160
About fucking time. Well, you know court orders and all that so

232
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
But I love the fact that

233
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I don't really care about what happened to his show so much. I just love the fact he caught no

234
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,880
I love the fact they called Adam the pale wookie

235
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,840
That that's pretty good. I love like that. Oh, so I guess I guess if Adam's the pale wookie

236
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
That makes me a job of the butt

237
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
And that makes you are too dildo

238
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,680
Excellent and let's see that would make let's do jersey tie can be princess lay a burg

239
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,000
And let's see and comic strip blogger is specimen jar jar banks

240
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
So there you go

241
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Oh, yes, it's Friday

242
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,720
It certainly is how can you tell?

243
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,800
So it's so speaking of CSB right?

244
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,400
So I yeah, we had that call with CSB

245
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:28,280
And yeah, yeah, exactly and but what what really happened the true story behind it

246
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,960
It you know, we did it over Skype because God knows where he is

247
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
And

248
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Two blocks away, but

249
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,000
So Skype fucking crashed the first time of course like fucking Skype does it just locked up

250
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,400
And uh, it's

251
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,720
I tie it it really it really annoyed me so because we had a great call going

252
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,840
But it it locked up like Mary Kate also in at knife point so but

253
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:06,760
We we have a transcription because I have the text calculator plug in for Skype

254
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,840
So it transcribed the whole thing I actually have a ticker tape machine that it transcribed it all too

255
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
So what I figure we do

256
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,440
Is Mike have you and I we should why don't we reenact?

257
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
Okay the conversation

258
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Okay, so

259
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,600
Basically you want to be well how about how about if we since it's gonna be a and a reenactment right?

260
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Why don't you play me?

261
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,680
And I'll be I'll be CSB and you know, well, uh, well, you know

262
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,000
Well basically try to make it seem exactly like it would have been had we recorded that first

263
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,240
ill-fated phone call

264
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,840
Try to figure out how to sound like if I squeeze my nose and say fuck a lot

265
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,480
Perfect you got it

266
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:04,040
Bingo okay, okay, all right, so okay, so ring ring ring ring and I go hello

267
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,320
Oh, he's this it's Mark you'll show out an app cafe CSB what what the fuck happened hey

268
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,120

269
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,320
And now I am I am too busy beating off. I cannot talk to you. What do you a fuck do you want?

270
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
I just have a couple more questions

271
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,000
What what the fuck is your real name?

272
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,720
Mike my real name is Cheryl

273
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,320
But that is not that is not a concern of yours that is no concern of yours

274
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,640
Oh, oh people want a fucking know what your real name is

275
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,120
I just have a couple more questions

276
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,560
What's it like I have fucking sex with your grandparents?

277
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,960
It it is it is all right. There is no shame in having sex with your grandparents

278
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,960
They the grandmother's bosom is warm and soft and smells like soup

279
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,520
So I there is nothing wrong with that

280
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,320
Did you do both of them at the same fucking time?

281
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,640
But maybe maybe I did maybe I did maybe I did it. I have not telling you yes, baby

282
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,040
I guess I did okay, so what oh?

283
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,240
How the fuck are how old are you are your grandparents still alive?

284
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,760
Hey, well, that is not because any concern of yours

285
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,680
Maybe maybe maybe sex with my grandparents involved they shovel in some digging, but that is no concern of yours

286
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,560
Cucksucker mother fucker. I hate you

I mean maybe I yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe I am

289
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:43,800
So one one one last question. Is this Kevin Rose? No no comment and

290
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
And seen

291
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,280
There you go. I think I nailed you I think you did too. I think that was a perfect imitation of you

292
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
I though you meant that way

293
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,640
Well, yeah, I see I still don't know what happened the other night after we went to the pub and had the bangers and mash

294
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:20,280
So what do you think the spatula came from? Hey, myocard stericons didn't he end it's free by Friday here already and

295
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:27,720
Well, I was listening to DC 584 and that that was in tents with CSB. I was waiting for

296
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,400
I don't know I don't know he had to get thrown across

297
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,120
I don't know how far away he is from the curry man over there, but

298
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:43,160
Oh, I was holding my breath at he was nuts, but you know, it was laughing as well

299
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,520
I yeah, I that's my reaction anyway, but

300
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,600
Get it up on the book publishing podshow press that that just sounds wicked

301
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,760
My my god something that I've had you know just sitting around you know tucked away

302
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,000
You know not not how I had him touch that that's that's a comment for another day

303
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,800
But I've had this story called war plan. You know just sitting

304
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,320
On let's spend online, but you know I haven't really talked too much about it until now

305
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,200
You see it's a short story fictional that I wrote a very long time ago, but I decided to you know

306
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:30,520
Give the podcast novel to go so you know I you know rewrote little bits of it and stuff and made it into like a little short story podcast

307
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,920
This five really short chapters you can find them at warplans.com and

308
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,720
And I've had the idea well say you want to be a writer as you know anyone can pretty much be one

309
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,560
We've podcasting anything like that, but you know it takes a lot of effort to think of ideas and you know

310
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:55,240
Creating cover art and everything like that so what I thought is everyone can get together as a community and submit ideas

311
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,240
And it can become a fully like ginormous novel like

312
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,320
Scott singular type of novel, you know probably not that big, but

313
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,520
Everyone can combine their ideas and hey don't be like the basically the cover will just be

314
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,080
Tiny little text of every single person's name who's an author on it

315
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,600
So do you think that'll be just an awesome idea just combining everyone's ideas together if you want to

316
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,760
Listen to what it will plan calm, but if you want to send a contribution to one of the chapters or something

317
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Email warpland at gmail.com

318
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,400
I just I just think it's great idea and if anyone yeah go and check it out

319
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:38,520
Lastly on my other podcast the pod show about nothing Monday world out that was just an awesome day for me

320
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,880
That was just basically speaking to my idol and you know

321
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,440
It's not too often in life you think you get to do that. I mean unless you some years reported you know interview someone

322
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,000
You're telling you been doing this. Yeah, some boring interview

323
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,960
I was on Skype with JC Hutchins the author of seventh son, which is JC Hutchins.net

324
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,240
And I spoke to him, you know for an hour. We'll just chat and think in a crazy ideas of how seven thund can

325
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,040
Is going to become a film and stuff and you know

326
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,920
I don't want to give too much away, but that interview is going to be on the podjab

327
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,240
And I think in the next week or so it's going to put all the it's it's like an hour long

328
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,280
You know, it's going to have to maybe cut it in a bit. So I think I'll just throw the whole thing up there just you know you can listen to

329
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,240
DSC 584 which went for like two hours on a phone call with some Russian

330
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,640
You can listen to it giddy up interview with JC up ease just awesome and you know

331
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,360
I I just can't say enough about him checking out JC Hutchins on it

332
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:46,760
I'm going to go get food barred right now and I don't know jump in the Pacific Ocean or something like that

337
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:10,120

So I would probably have enough to sell so I decided to try it right now

Now we can get to the real show

365
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,720
You know every week every week I get two emails from the same two guys in Ohio that listen to my series show

366
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200

Jeff Chikone who said he said CSP is a fucking idiot

374
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,600
No, but he but he qualifies it. He doesn't just make a you know

375
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Right, he says he says

376
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:17,400
To ask you why you say fuck all the time and not realize that is because you're from Philly

377
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Makes him a fucking idiot

378
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,360
Wait wait wait wait. Do people in Philly say fuck all the time you think so

379
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,920

00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,800
But I love that and I got this email. I got a bunch of great emails. Let me just read a call a couple of these

383
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,600
Mostly because we have to fill time. No, I'm just kidding. We got this email from

384
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,560
Says deer Narcassie Mofo Dumbkov on behalf of both of

385
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:03,320
On behalf of both well-adjusted heterosexual listeners of the daily daily cold sore. I would like to bestow upon you the anal

386
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,400
yearly Don I'm a sword for pubic service

387
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,080
It's only because of your tiresome efforts that we who assume and spit out the RIA laden

388
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:20,680
The RIA laden come can be fried my head is off to you from the bottom of my bottom

389
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:28,360
Long may you rain long may your rain be in your hands keep the stiff in your upper lip

390
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,320
Sign Eve Kersky I'm Siberia Russia

391
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,120
Yes, my friends Veta is shaved, but she does not have razor burn

392
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,040
Do you think she uses American mock three razor?

393
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,480
We want you to come see who I'm to Siberia this winter to put the the goo in our log

394
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,480
for

395
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,280
Gulag are you man enough to do this thing?

396
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:59,080
I am supplying picture of me in Prague so that you can see Eastern European men are not interested in having me

397
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,800
We are having so many women who need to have a big bottom boom that is why we

398
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,720
Always like men from the United States we have so many orgasms that go on fulfilled

399
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Thank you. Thank you. Eve

400
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,680
Kersky, so so we're going to progress. I guess we're going to Prague

401
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
I'm thinking that's CSB's cousin so

402
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,760
Maybe or Simon's twin possibly

403
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,320
And let's see here we go Andrew heron writes in

404
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:37,880
Love what you've been doing with the hijack DSC. I only listen to 583 because I didn't get to download it before the server move

405
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,120
I couldn't pick your previous fake savants, but the prolific promo

406
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:53,720
Another note you might oh, I managed shadow falls bubble. Okay. No, I'll actually I'm going to write to Andy back because there's some stuff in here

407
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Some personal stuff just me and Andy

408
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,880
They talked about some stuff that I know the rest of the DSC listeners don't want to hear this point

409
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,880
But he's talking about the you know shadow falls number one with a bullet and God forbid

410
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,800
I should you know plug my shows any more than I do, but you know

411
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,280
So according to CSB

412
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,840
Why do you plug your shows? Why do you plug everybody shows?

413
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:21,960
Maybe because I want people listen. Okay. I don't know I don't know tired of my dog and I sitting here listening

414
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,160
What exactly so anyway, but thank you. I Andrew. I appreciate that and

415
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,760
I got to tell you that was a thrilling email. I'm sorry. Yeah, I see I should screen this stuff before

416
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
All right, there that's well, you know like I got it

417
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,720
It's probable it sounds like mice oh my god

418
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Bite me FCC dot com

419
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
That's right. You see radio positive. That's right

420
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:54,520
So it's it's probably about is well, you know what's what's even more interesting is that in the mail yesterday

421
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,840
I open up my mailbox and along with all the crap that's there and you know credit card solicitations

422
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,040
I got a piece of someone else's mail

423
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,920
And yeah, this is almost like I couldn't believe it because you know

424
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,160
I've gotten mail before for you know people across the street or whatever

425
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,640
This is literally a piece of mail for someone who who lives

426
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
Maybe six or seven blocks away and

427
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,880
They have the same house number, but it's a different street

428
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,560
But what makes this piece of mail so interesting is that it's the

429
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,120
Newsletter

430
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,320
For the national right to life foundation the April

431
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,480
2007

432
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
And I was like oh

433
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Thank you god

434
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,920
And on the cover is the national right to life convention for

435
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,560
2007 in Kansas City June 14 16 so pack your bag like

436
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,400
Oh, man, we're going so you can do some live in

437
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:03,000
Or semi-life oh my god, so it's like you know and it's amazing because

438
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:10,920
It's like you look at the sensationalistic nature of the way they cover their quote stories in here

439
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,600
You know and it's like a

440
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,520
President and congressional democratic leaders face off on embryo killing research

441
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,280
That's the headline on the front page, you know, it's like they have to use like embryo killing and

442
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It's just that's a good term and

443
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,680
And you know there's an interview with bioethicist

444
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Wesley J Smith

445
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
You know and it's just like

446
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:45,080
See the sad things that they probably know who that is yeah, and that that's the thing is tough means well he's a bioethicist

447
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,120
You know what is that exactly that's that's a fucking made up word, you know

448
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Much like podcasting so it's

449
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,600
Kind of you know and then and it's just it's amazing to me

450
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,720
I haven't really looked through it yet because I'm afraid to touch it

451
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
But it's

452
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,480
It seems to me ironic this shows up in my mailbox the very same day that

453
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,800
The I don't I don't know if maybe my postman's a PCH listener DS elistner, but

454
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:22,840
entirely possible I guess but the very same day that the US Supreme Court issues a ban

455
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Unpartial birth abortion

456
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Now, okay, I'm not gonna claim to know what partial birth abortion is

457
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:37,080
I'm not sure I want it. Yeah, yeah, it does sound a little a little kind of gooey. Yeah, actually that's

458
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,040
So I was gonna say chunky, but gooey's probably gooey's probably better

459
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,160
And that's the thing, you know, it's like here's here's something that has been legal in this country

460
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't know a partial birth abortion is but it's a procedure that's been legal in this country

461
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,800
You know for like 30 years

462
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,720
I get you know what I think the thing is isn't this like the 30th anniversary or roe v Wade or something or 40th or something?

463
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,840
Yeah, it is and so they overturn this procedure and

464
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,800
It just seems to me it's like all all the

465
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:21,480
Advances that we've made in personal freedoms over the last 40 years from civil rights to you know women getting the right to earn less than men

466
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,520
You know all those freedoms that we've gained in this country

467
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,440
Um

468
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,440
We're about to lose them

469
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,480
Because we have this conservative Supreme Court

470
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,280
You know a spanky in the White House there or Sparky what do you call?

471
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
What do I yeah

472
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,080
Spanky so spanky the bush my sister spanky. I'm sorry. I was looking at partial birth

473
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
Okay

474
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
I'm listening

475
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,360
But you know it would be better if you looked up partial birth abortion with your pants on

476
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,360
It would make me feel a little bit more comfortable

477
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:01,160
Probably true. So anyway, so spanky, you know a point a bunch of fucking clowns to the Supreme Court

478
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,200
Who you know a bunch of totes and he was gonna appoint this Harry and Myers

479
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,360
To the Supreme Court you remember that whole thing yeah, I do I mean, come on. Here was a woman who's qualifications to be on the Supreme Court

480
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,400
Or that I guess she perfectly fit underneath George Bush's desk

481
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,280
So you know she should be on the on the Supreme Court

482
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,480
Underhead was right and the same thing with the guy that they made chief justice whatever that fucking smiling

483
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,320
Gonzalez, I don't know the chief justice. Yeah, I can't even remember that

484
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:41,400
Yeah, it doesn't really know he always had that smile on his face like you know, yeah, I'm getting away with this

485
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,280
Yeah, I'm getting away with so it's the same grin the bush monster has yeah exactly like oh, yeah

486
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:55,880
It's kind of like that can fuse look what I got away exactly. That's exactly the look that's the look that you and I had on the plane

487
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,920
After we ditched the you know the the bloody glove in the spatula

488
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,080
So

489
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,920
Anyway, anyway, okay, you know looking looking at partial birth abortion

490
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:15,240
It ain't pretty. Yeah, I can't imagine as I can't imagine any abortion procedure is pretty, but but the thing is you know it's like

491
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,280
It's one of those things where it's to me. It's like the issue of flag burning

492
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,000
Now

493
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
To me and call me crazy, right?

494
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,440
There if you're in a country that

495
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,840
Professes freedom as the main tenant of its existence

496
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:43,000
Right there is no greater proof that you have freedom in your country than the ability to criticize your government

497
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:51,480
Right there's no greater freedom in your country than to basically take the symbol of that country

498
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,440
And the file it right to set it on fire

499
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,920
I'm not saying wipe your ass with the flag

500
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,000
Right, yeah, but but to set the flag on fire to me is almost like yeah, I mean I wouldn't do it

501
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,760
You know

502
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,440
As much as I criticize the government in this country and would probably criticize any government that was there because they you know

503
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:18,040
All governments do fucked up shit. They all suck, but you know, it's like well, what's what's the saying on UC radio

504
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
Pacho suck less more offense

505
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,040
Yeah, so you know we would like to have that happen in Washington, but

506
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Yeah, good luck

507
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,200
But yeah, so to me it's like the same issue, you know, it's kind of like when you start to say well you can't do this

508
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,840
And you can't do that

509
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,800
Then are we really a country based upon freedom or

510
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:46,840
Convenient freedom, you know, it's like oh well you can do this, but you know this might disturb some people

511
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:52,760
So you shouldn't do it and you know, well actually make it even worse than shouldn't you can't do it now

512
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:59,400
Yeah, that's a good term convenient free. Yeah, and and that's what we're turning into because it's a country of convenient freedom

513
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,680
Just because you know somebody's feelings might be hurt

514
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,320
Well the whole thing with flag burning just I mean to pick that issue

515
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:12,280
I always kind of thought of it as like a three-year-old throwing a tantrum. It's if you pay attention to it

516
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,280
They're gonna keep doing it and it becomes an issue if you just kind of let them do it and ignore it

517
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:22,600
It'll stop because it doesn't really mean anything. No, it doesn't mean anything and that's that's exactly the point

518
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,840
It's not like somebody is like burning down the flag and the White House

519
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:35,720
You know, that's what that's wrapping it around a body and then right exactly exactly that's the point if you were wrapping the flag around nuns and orphans and then burning it

520
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,640
Then I have it right exactly so

521
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,120
Especially if the nuns were hot, but that's that's a whole other topic for a different day

522
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,960
But anyway, so anyway, you know, I'm not I'm not gonna pry it on about this, but it's just

523
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,040
Amazing to me the kind of funny stuff that ends up in your mailbox

524
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,360
That that's pretty lucky. It is it was at a total stroke of luck. I couldn't believe it because I said you know what

525
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,400
I can kill 13 minutes a daily source code time

526
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,680
This this is bought me 13 minutes of programming

527
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:15,240
You know, let me ask you a question about your mailbox. So when you open it, do you open it standing off to the side and kind of covering your face?

528
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,400
You know what I do? I actually have a remote control switch that pops open the front

529
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,240
So I

530
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,640
Send my Layotion house boy out

531
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,880
So open it

532
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,520
I don't know the name of this one because you know they all

533
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,200
They just come out. I don't exactly

534
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,960
And that's M-A-I-L so yeah, yeah, but anyway, so

535
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,920
Yeah

536
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,600
Hey, did you want to a gulfard angle and quick test please

537
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,440
Just a Lewis Carroll the author of Alice in Wonderland is buried in gulfard?

538
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,960
No kidding. I did not know that. Yeah, he actually he actually wrote the book

539
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,000
Alice in Wonderland and looking through through the looking glass while living in gulfard. Wow

540
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,760
Yeah, he's in the Mount Cemetery right there. Wow. Well, let's see. You want to know another question?

541
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:13,240
Okay, let's see uh this is a this is an important one the gulfard police force has

542
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,440
1,921 officers which is a down 33 officers from last year

543
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,520
Okay

544
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:31,320
That's what I do here. I find the fact. Wow. Let's see that's interesting. See I wonder how many of those officers actually take the time

545
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,920
To patrol the area around the the glory hole and the wall behind Adam's house

546
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Yeah, I didn't see any

547
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:49,000
Yeah, well, you know as because I spent so much time staring through the glory hole, but

548
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:58,760
But anyway, so but I'm I'm glad to be back on your soil. I'm just glad to be home

549
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,360
We'll jet lag, but I'm glad to be home because I was starting to pick up an English accent

550
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,480
You I figured fucking if Madonna can do it. I can yes, so tell you

551
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
I hope hip hip in all that jolly good

552
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:16,840
I've dropped my ages now so everything's like an omen in early and I got to get em now. Oh mow

553
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,120
Yeah, you know mow

554
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,960
So anyway, and so when we landed right

555
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,200
I was actually I've surprised to find out that they voted San Gio off of American Idol

556
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,680
Did you see that? I know it's hard. I'm going to drink

557
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Yeah

558
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
I didn't see that and I

559
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,080
I'm actually

560
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,040
Relieved

561
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:49,320
Because I was tired of hearing about it. Me too. I really was too, but you know, and I love the fact that you know, everybody was claiming

562
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,040
That

563
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:58,440
San Gio was staying on American Idol because well not everybody, but people were saying that was because of the efforts of a website called vote for the worst

564
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,200
dot com

565
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,400
And they were prodding they were saying vote for San Gio because he sucks and we want to undermine the whole idol thing

566
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,560
Which is what what they claim they did with the fucking gray-haired guy

567
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:16,520
Oh, yeah, uh the guy looks like he's having a seizure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it looks like joke cocker young version

568
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,560
Yeah, so I was looking on vote for the worst dot com and

569
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,960
You should see the the hate mail they get it's fucking amazing

570
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,600
You got to go to vote for the worst dot com just to see the hate mail

571
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,600
Yeah, yeah, let me read something this is from the mail bag update

572
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Was this April 10th? I just picked one a random because they're all very similar

573
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,000
This is all sent all in caps, okay?

574
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,520
You know good and trusted come stains you made my favorite go

575
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,800
I guess there's some her favorite go vote up in case in case built like all one word

576
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,680
Your why oh you are two t-o stupid to know which one I mean

577
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:05,800
Gina glocks and she was by far the best this year how dare you send her away when that pony hawk asshole San Gio stay

578
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,320
I'm reading this verbatim

579
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:15,000
This is warm other fuckers. I will be contacting my lawyer to sue your ass

580
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:23,640
Stearns, I guess you means Howard Stern and all the members of your evil cult cult oh with an exclamation point in an eye

581
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:31,400
That's because it's called I will revenge Gina and you all will be poor living in a cardboard box if box if

582
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:38,520
Box if San Gio had a brain in his head he would sue you all also for mental stress and slander

583
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
See you in court

584
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Dave and the rest of you dogpugs signed

585
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,200
Candence her name is not Candace Candence Candence

586
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,720
So where's she from it doesn't say where she's from and then

587
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,080
And I love the next one. I will indeed yeah exactly and there's another one

588
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:02,360
This isn't a right website. You should delet d-e-l-e-t this website

589
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:09,720
I am going to protest to have you delete this website and send it to you. I will get a hundred names on the list and send it

590
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,560
signed l

591
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,640
l-l-e

592
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
So I mean

593
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,280
This is what it's come yeah and you know it's amazing because it's obvious these emails are from

594
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,360
you know

595
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,520
Pre-teen girls

596
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,400
The vote for the worst has angered

597
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,960
Pre-teen girls and young teenage girls. I mean obviously the most annoying demographic on the planet as it is

598
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:44,840
If you if you you know, and now they've got a rally exactly if you've ever been to a movie theater at the same time as pre-teen girls

599
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,600
You know exactly what I'm fucking talking about

600
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,720
yeah, and

601
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,600
So it should be legal to slap pre-teen girls who talk in a movie theater

602
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:01,240
There really you know we were sitting in a movie a couple weeks ago and these two girls were in front of us text messaging each other during the movie

603
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,240
Yeah, each other

604
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,600
Text messaging each other during so so there you go, so for the right I just wanted to slap the back of their

605
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:14,360
Don't grab their hello kitty berays and just smack their heads together

606
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:22,520
Yeah, exactly so so for the rest of you who may not know what it's like to be around American pre-teen girls

607
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:30,840
This this may give you an example, so so so American pre-teen girls are all up in arms and all pissed off about vote for the worst dot

608
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,760
So well, I'm just glad Sanjay is gone

609
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,120
Really, I mean, I don't watch American idol. I just don't care, but I'm just tired of hearing about him

610
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:47,000
Yeah, I am too really, but I just I just love the fact that they've angered all these young girls to send these emails

611
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,560
And yeah, well, which is actually

612
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,160
It's not too unlike

613
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,600
Some of the hate mail that we've received over the week

614
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,640
Yeah, doing daily source code. I won't read anything verbatim, but

615
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:09,160
There was there was one. Oh god. This is a great one. Oh my god. You got to go to um daily source code dot pod show dot com

616
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,400
And some some guy because you can see his picture name

617
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Renee and

618
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,040
Hello in in America Renee is a girls name so

619
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:29,240
Said basically I love this he he's so pissed he said I have temporarily I've temporarily unsubscribed a daily source code

620
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:34,760
It's like something like nemcoff sucks and I've temporarily unsubscribed a daily source code

621
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,680
You know, and I will never listen to Pacific coast hell away

622
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:46,040
And I'm like oh Renee say it eight so please come back come back to PC age

623
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,400
Like this guy ever listened to PC H to begin with

624
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:57,400
Like this is the kind of like douche bag that we have in our PC H demographic

625
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,800
Our new specs are totally yeah, exactly we have a totally different group of douche bags

626
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,800
It lives into us so

627
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,720
That's too much I was missing a download. Oh my god. So oh, man. So yeah

628
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:22,200
So yeah, so yeah, so he might maybe he missed a PC H at 583 so I don't know

629
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,200
But yeah

630
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,080
So it's a shame, you know, I think there was a there was a problem with the feed

631
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,600
Actually, you know Adam said there was a I guess was he had a radio user land feed he has like three or four feeds

632
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,080
So it was a problem with a one a one or two of the feeds

633
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
Um and I think

634
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:46,680
One or two of the shows this week. I think 583 didn't get out to I got a bunch of emails from people like the jamcast guy

635
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,920
Said he didn't get 583 or something

636
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,560
You should just put it up on the PC H oh

637
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,680
Fucking fucking great idea gold star for you. You know what I'm gonna I'm gonna put PC H or the NTSC 583

638
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:05,080
In the PC H feed what yeah, why not exactly so you can get it on iTunes

639
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:11,400
But we got that and there was like some other thing like of course comic strip blogger was like he was like ragging on you like oh

640
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,240
You're you're your guest to say they are skissing and blah, blah, blah

641
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,360
And then and well, that's me. I mean, yes, exactly yeah

642
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
You're the PC H yes, man, so

643
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
Exactly

644
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,800
See you just agreed

645
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,800
I did you agreed again

646
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,800
Yes, you keep agreeing with me

647
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,440
I

648
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,440
Then what I love is that

649
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:42,920
So after comic strip blogger the same thing happened like a couple of days in a row that right after him some other fucking like

650
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,640

00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,640

652
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,000
You know agreeing with the all this socks and all that and I'm like

653
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,560
Guys, this is a fucking podcast

654
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,560
You don't have to listen to it

655
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,160
But I love the fact that this one guy who's like

656
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,440
Digital dildo or something like that whatever is fucking

657
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,000
Handle is on pod show

658
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,920
This is fucking jiz bag. He fucking hated Monday show, right?

659
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,920
But then he also hated like Tuesday or Wednesday show as well and I'm like

660
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:21,400
That just I love that that he listened to it again because he knew he would hate it

661
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,520
Yeah, I get email like that but see that perfect people bag on me and then they keep listening to the show

662
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:33,560
What do you do you cannot ask for anything more than that people who listen to you because they hate you?

663
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,840
That's fucking awesome

664
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,360
They get a little gold star when it shows up in my Gmail like god just so I know who they are

665
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,440
Yeah, so a digital digital douche nozzle or whatever you are

00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,440
Just you know hey just saying hi to you today so anyway

667
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,720
Yes, all right

668
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,320
Um

669
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,320
I think we're done for today. Oh

670
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,840
You know here. I'm gonna do my um, you know a final thought for the week. Oh, yeah

671
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,840
Yeah, so

672
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,920
You know what I need some music. I think you need to like hum or something like that

673
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,200
What do you want? Um, I don't know uh

674

I'll girl for me. Okay

675

Me me

676
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,680
My final thought for the week. Oh, you know what you better not that's that's probably not pod safe

677
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:29,080
Yeah, well, but I'm probably not humming it right. Oh, okay. Yeah, so change it change it around a little bit

678
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,840
So I can home stop foot at one. There you go. Humps um stump foot at one man

679
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,440
Okay, oh, let's see stop foot

00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,120
Now that won't work. I'll change girlfriend you can you okay

681
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,800
Why not so the final thought for the week

682
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,360
I first of all. I want to thank everybody you hung with the DSE

683
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,240
for this week

684
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,880
Hung being the operative word

685
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,200
I'm so distracted by mics humming, but it's okay

686
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,680
And you know it I got to tell you podcasting is all about choices. It's about making

687
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,880
choices of what you want is your entertainment and whether you listen to something because you love it

688
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,600
Are you hated you're still making a choice and you're saying you know what fuck corporate media?

689
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,080
I want to listen to podcasting and that's to me the most important thing

690
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:23,720
About what we're doing here in new media. So I just again. I want to say thank you to everybody and

691
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,720
next week

692
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:32,840
Um it reverts back from the daily cold sword to the daily source code when Adam comes back from his gender reassignment surgery

693
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,840
And um I guess he'll talk to you then

694
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,840
Yeah, I didn't really have anything good. I was just rambling so

695
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,680
But I

696
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,200
I have no idea

697
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:52,920
It was nice by the way. It was nice. Yeah, thank you. I used to be a jazz singer. So I went to the next shows when the three o'clock

698
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,920

00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,440
He sent me something when it insert in the show so Jerry just want to let you know that well

712
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,080
Actually I'm going to insert in the show before I talk about Jerry so it's almost like a day-chavu kind of thing

This might catch you later

722
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,760
You would feel I love the kind of boy

723
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,320
What a girl like me

724
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:54,040
Never let's do love your words to know the danger you could be

725
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,040
If you come

726
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,840
Wow

727
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,800
We get back I should have seen you again

728
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,680
But then when you were finally

729
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:33,680
And I know I'll never trust you in the way

730
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,680
But what am I to be?

731
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:44,680
Because if you come home

732
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,680
Now I won't be here

733
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:55,680
And if you come home

734
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,680
Now I won't be

735
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:05,680
And I know I'll never trust you in the way

736
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,680
And if you come home

737
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,680
Now I won't be here

738
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,680
And if you come home

739
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,680
Now I won't be here

740
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,680
And if you come home

741
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,680
Now I won't be here

742
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,680
So I'll never trust you in the way

743
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:38,680
And if you come home

744
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,680
Now I won't be here

745
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:51,680
And if you come home

746
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,680
Here

747
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,680
Mark

748
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,680
Mark

749
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,680
What's going on then?

750
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,680
Ben Patterson here

751
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,680
Yeah, I'm sorry to get you cut off in the last couple episodes

752
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,680
You see when I said I was resisting my captors and dancers

753
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,680
I didn't mean that it relevant to you expect that more

754
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,680
That guy is kind of irrelevant

755
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,680
You wouldn't know where to find a podcast

756
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,680
Actually I was resisting Adam's advantages

757
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,680
You see I guess somebody left the N800 in the closet with him

758
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,680
And he's been calling in

759
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,680
So that was Adam beeping in

760
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,680
I guess he's trying to find people to join him in the closet

761
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,680
I guess he kind of likes it in them

762
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,680
I don't know

763
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,680
That's his business

764
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,680
Anyway

765
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,680
I really enjoyed the comments

766
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,680
By the gentleman Jonathan Billock has following the comment yesterday

767
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,680
A sister of the cultural cool man

768
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,680
As a late great electric lester bang one throughout in

769
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,680
Autotic reactions and coberator done

770
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,680
We're all being sold a culture of cool

771
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,680
Every piece of culture, every piece of art

772
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,680
Any piece any product we buy

773
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,680
We're buying an extension of ourselves

774
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,680
We're expressing ourselves through what we buy

775
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,680
How we dress the culture we create and consume

776
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,680
There's nothing necessarily or inherently wrong with that

777
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,680
But John was dead on with that comment

778
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,680
Especially about independent musicians and making it big

779
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,680
So anyway, I'm going to go before Adam calls again

780
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,680
Don't tell him I don't want to join him in the closet

781
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,680
And Doug Morris

782
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,680
Good luck finding me man

783
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,680
There you are Mark

784
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,680
Hey Mark, it's Noah from Santa Barbara, California

785
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:38,680
I was just kind of to tell you that I was going to do a source code today

786
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,680
And you're going to do with comic strip blogger

787
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,680
Man that guy's full of fucking shit

788
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,680
Let me tell you, he's asking me questions like

789
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,680
What have you ever created?

790
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,680
Jesus Christ dude

791
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,680
Let me just point out that I've been listening to the data

792
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,680
To specifically grow cell ways

793
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,680
And another one of six or one or nine or something like that

794
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,680
So it was a lot like two years

795
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,680
And they don't need to do my days

796
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,680
All the time, it means the work can be used to school

797
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,680
Fucking love piece of shit

798
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,680
So do stuff out on every day

799
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,680
Number one with the bullet

800
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,680
Fucking awesome

801
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,680
Okay, just in the shot up and I'm glad that I got it at the end

802
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,680
So I didn't have to wait for week to week to download it

803
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,680
Because I was just going crazy

804
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,680
Doomsday club on chapter 11

805
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,680
But I just bought it on Amazon because I can't wait week to week for it

806
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,680
So I'm just going to read from chapter 11 on like eight blocks

807
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,680
Just some great deal on Amazon

808
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:38,680
And also a bone, so listen to that

809
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,680
I just don't know, I don't want to steal what this guy's talking shit about

810
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,680
He just sounds like a fucking idiot to me

811
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,680
And yeah, so anyways

812
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,680
I like what you do with the daily source code

813
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,680
Really funny

814
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,680
Come back to PC it soon

815
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,680
Yeah, just a lot of shit man

816
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,680
You turn me on the podcast and actually turned on man

817
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,680
I don't mean like sexually but actually sexually from my ears

818
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,680
Yeah, anyways

819
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,680
So yeah, I'm going to keep it up

820
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,680
And when it's done how this shot out to my friend Derek and Minnesota

821
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,680
You got fucking clear

822
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,680
And yeah, he actually told me the other night that he had clay

823
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,680
You know, there was some massive shots and

824
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,680
Ryan C. Crescent has a chance

825
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,680
We're going to clear anyways

826
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,680
Okay

827
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,680
Yeah, I wanted to drop a comment regarding

828
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,680
Yeah, really industry

829
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,680
Good champagne and all the other conglomerate assholes that are

830
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,680
Fucking out what should be a decent industry

831
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,680
But anyways

832
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,680
Yeah, the big champagne stuff

833
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,680
Talk come they don't share the entire research with

834
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,680
Like everybody just approved their flight

835
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,680
And that's just the RIA

836
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,680
Is it only because they're being paid by the RIA

837
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,680
I mean, when somebody drops like 30 bucks to see the entire report

838
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:03,680
And maybe that wouldn't satisfy people to reduce their number of downloads

839
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,680
Probably not, so I need this to say

840
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,680
You know, where's open disclosure

841
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,680
That's I guess that's really my point

842
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,680
Everybody knows that the whole music industry

843
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,680
It's been, you know, basically ripping off the public

844
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,680
And C.D. sales anyway

845
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,680
And a lot of people don't even remember the fact that the RIA

846
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,680
And the sales are sued by the federal government

847
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,680
For protecting the price gouging that they were doing

848
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,680
Remember when C.D.s were 20 dollars now that they're keen

849
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,680
That's a reason for that

850
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,680
Anyway

851
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,680
I kind of dropped that message

852
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,680
