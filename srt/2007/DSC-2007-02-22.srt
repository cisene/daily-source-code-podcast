Hey, Adam, you ever play that game where you pass a phrase from person to person

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and then you see what it comes back as after it's going through several people?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, try to do that at the podcast music live through a combination of Skype and second life

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In a world where TV networks, movie studios and record labels

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
still think they can govern what you see in here.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000

The young pumps.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Apparently making some noise in British.

Hey everybody how you doing coming to you from the curry condo. It is the Daily

108

109
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,000
California for a second time on the new time schedule for the year so it's

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,280
going to be about a week of course as you know delayed so I'll be leaving

111
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,800
and I was at Thursday. I got to get back because Saturday evening at the

112
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,440
Lady Patricia and I'm not this coming Saturday but next Saturday we have a

113
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,920
dinner a dinner at Dawson. A dinner date with one of the head honchos of

114
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,160
BT at his house. Oh man speaking of posh people which we'll talk about later

115
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,760
of course. The young punk's by the way and not coincidental that I played

116
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,960
that I got an email from Nigel from podcastlive.co.uk who of course was

117
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,400
instrumental in getting Howard Jones onto the pod save music network. He says

118
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,760
he broke the young punk's to the podcast community on Sunday. Today he got a

119
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,600
message from their management. The young punk's are on news night tonight and

120
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
we're on all local BBC radio this morning which went out to 10 and a half

121
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,400
million people coverage in the mirror in the Daily Record as well. Hey hey hey

122
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:58,920
getting some shit done with that pod save music fantastic. Oh man I'm thankful

123
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,720
that as plenty of stuff that came in while I was traveling I am tired. I really am.

124
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,800
This is like a mid week thing you know when I was kind of prepared to go

125
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,320
on Sunday it's very different and I didn't watch any movies on the flight.

126
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,480
Right about half of a book I'll get it in a second for you and I'll tell you what

127
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,920
book it is. Oh it's how the world was taken over by mumbo jumbo or something

128
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,000
like that. Pretty interesting book. And I don't know what happened though but I

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,880
am. My back really really hurts left side lower like lower back which is

130
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,240
very close to the area where I had which I heard when my motorcycle accident

131
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,960
three years ago. So I get I'm old. It's just acting up. Oh what can I do? Oh yes of

132
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:50,720
course there's always Amy Mac to save the day and make my ass nice and firm in

133
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,640
the process.

134
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,080
Adam it's Amy Mac. Hey baby how you doing? I'm glad to hear you feeling and

135
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,040
sounding better. Yeah. Although it seems that every time you get sick I end up

136
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,480
with it a week later. For two people with a sea each other it's a little

137
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,640
strange. Anyway today we're doing an airplane with it. We've had and switched

138
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,120
mics. Good. I only have one with me so I have to use this.

139
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,160
Start standing with a part. I'm standing though that's good. Okay

140
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,840
shoulder your arms up to the side. Arms out to the side. Even with my shoulders

141
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,240
hip. Now bend forward until your chest is facing the floor. Okay. Now take the right

142
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,320
leg and lift it behind you. From the side you should look like a capital T or an

143
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,800
airplane on a stick. Or an asshole. Great. Now bring everything back to the

144
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,040
starting position. I could feel it though. I could see it. Which legs I've been

145
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,360
bend over and lift the left leg at the same time. Go as far as you can without

146
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,800
tipping over. Really want to lift that leg and squeeze the butt. Good. Now

147
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,720
I'll make and do seven on each side. Okay. I'm doing real quick. Okay. Remember to

148
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,360
breathe through the whole thing. You make it sound so easy. Make sure that standing

149
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,240
knee is slightly bent. Yeah. Yeah. It's the left one that really hurts

150
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,920
Amy. Squeeze the butt and the abs to prevent falling over. With the back

151
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,960
hurts it's not just the butt. Really try to lift that leg and keep your back

152
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,840
straight. Oh, this is great job. No. I mean, I can not plan for us to save the

153
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,440
world. The ass reciting. This all holds until I get the hang of the whole video

154
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,280
thing. There's so much to do for a little show. I'm not surprised but it's

155
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,000
definitely not routine yet. Okay. Well, I hope you have a good visit at HQ. Thank you

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,200
Amy. Amy. Let me tell you something. And by the way, Amy is doing a couple of

157
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,520
shows. She's got video going on. Of course, she's got fitness attack where

158
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:46,080
they me Mac. I'm all out of breath from the exercise. Amy, I guarantee you

159
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,920
if if you are going to do a video version of exercise, it'll be a ratings

160
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,600
Bonanza. What an awesome idea. How can I assist you in getting this done

161
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,680
even sooner? All right. Let's check the voicemail. See who called while I was in

162
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,160
the hour in the air for 10 hours. Adam, hello. It's Colin Grant here from BBC World

I'm not going to. I'm not going to.

165
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Number. Five.

166
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,560
That's a four. Jesus Christ.

167
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,200
Friday about Citizen Generalism. And I'm going to get you one. Okay, bye.

168
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,960
Friday about Citizen Journalism. Oh, Colin. This is not very hand. Why do you

169
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,640
guys always call so late? You know, for all the money, all the money that you guys

170
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,080
get, you should be able to schedule this a little bit more advanced. You know, now

171
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,120
I got a, I got, I don't know, I don't know, Colin. I don't know. I don't know if I can

172
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,280
do it. Well, I was reading something else by the BBC that the, uh, that's

173
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,840
some like advisory board at the governors or whatever they call it, uh, a very upset

174
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,960
that, uh, BBC, uh, the websites that are viewable outside of the UK are going to or

175
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:15,400
will or are carrying advertising. And the advertising is filtered out in the UK. It's

176
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,360
kind of weird. Although I'm not against it. I mean, I pay my 190 pounds a year for my, for

177
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,800
my TV license. And I'm very happy with the results. What I get for it, I think it's a damn

178
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,920
good deal. Um, and, uh, if you get me even better programming by exploiting and they sell

179
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,520
so much stuff already. It may, it's not like the BBC is not, uh, it does not have commercial

180
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,240
departments. They more and certainly have lots of commercial. It, look, a BBC's on serious

181
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,280
sidelight radio now. You think they give them that way for free? I don't think so. Let's

182
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,120
see what the next message is. Hi, I don't have a guy in his ex in the shakes. Hey,

183
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,080
I'm going to give you a bounce. I, uh, be listening. And thanks a plan. I'll stop. And, um,

184
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,400
yes, like, it's easy. Thanks for the support with Jason. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Thank you

185
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,560
guys for being on who's on it. And, uh, for going to podcast, con, UK and for performing.

186
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,080
And you guys are smart. Cause, you know, it's like a total guilt trip. Is like, how, how

187
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,720
can I not, you know, play that? And then, of course, not rip out with the shakes on the daily

188
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:27,960
source code. I want to bet a line. I want to bet a line. More than these four

189
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:41,800
worlds. I might have been why if I want to bet a line. I want to be your man. I want to be

190
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:55,800
your man. Cause you're pretty cool. And you've got to tell me what to be your man. I want to

191
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:11,400
be your man. I want to be your man. I want to be your man. I want to be your man. I want to be

192
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:19,800
your man. I want to be your man. I want to be your man. I want to be your man. I want to be your man.

193
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Cause you're pretty cool. And you've got to tell me what to be your man. I want to be your man.

194
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:51,800
I want to bet a line. I want to bet a line. I want to bet a line. I want to be your man.

195
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Just like the one day before, only fast in the world

196
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,800
What's happening here?

197
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,800
And I want to run the show

198
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,800
And I want to run the show

199
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Look down from on high, it's your grand-run battle

200
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,800
I want to run the show

201
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,800
And I want to run the show

202
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Look up from on high, it's your grand-run battle

203
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,800
And I want to run the show

204
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,800
You want to run the show

205
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
You want to run the show

206
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:59,100
Oh, this is it, this is it, this is it, this is it, this is it.

207
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,860
The shakes, you can find them on the Podsafe Music Network and of course, Podsho Plus,

208
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,820
Podsho.com slash music, just go to DavySourceco.com and get the direct link to the shakes.

209
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,800
I want a better life.

210
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
It's okay.

211
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,660
So I got some aspirin while I was doing that.

212
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,660
It's something really weird going on in the condo.

213
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:24,480
Everything was still connected when I came back, you know, the TV work and the internet

214
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
was up.

215
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:33,720
I did have to reboot the the wireless router, what I have a a D-Link 624, I think it

216
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
is.

217
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,400
And it's really strange, if you're very close to the unit, even it won't even see it.

218
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
So you can't even connect to it.

219
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,260
So you have to physically move away and there are some spots which are in a direct line

220
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,260
with the unit.

221
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:56,940
I can see it from where I'm standing and just like maybe ten, six, seven, maybe ten feet

222
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:04,360
away and and and and then you can see it then you can connect.

223
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,480
But if you veer like three foot, three feet to the left then it'll still stay connected.

224
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,580
But then, you know, there's no actual throughput of data, it's like I have all these dead spots

225
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,580
all of a sudden.

226
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,800
I have to admit, you know, being on the 24th floor here with the tower of death across

227
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,200
the street, which is now cranky, this thing is grown another seven stories it looks

228
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,800
like, God, that thing is ugly.

229
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,640
Hey, you're gonna take it away in my view.

230
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:38,220
There are so many Wi-Fi connections, this must be because there's just so much going on.

231
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,940
There, I mean, I think I can count 15 sometimes 25 different Wi-Fi points up here and

232
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,940
they come and go, you know, it's almost like when the wind blows.

233
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,500
But you would think that, and I have tried some different channels, I haven't done anything

234
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,420
this trip yet, so I'm not going to troubleshoot anything yet until you guys tell me what

235
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,540
I should try out, you know, is there some kind of, kind of the Mac, I know on the, I have

236
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,820
the eye Mac here, you can turn on interface robustness, which really makes me feel good

237
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,940
when I turn it on, whatever it means, but apparently that does help it seek out certain

238
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
signals better.

239
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,980
But you think the thing is sitting right here, you know, I should have a great connection,

240
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,580
but right now even the laptop that I'm using on the Baker's rack with cast blaster, you

241
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,420
know, to get a proper connection, I actually have to turn the laptop a little bit.

242
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:36,540
So somehow something is, something's freaky, that's what it is, email from Karen Hardy,

243
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:43,340
just listen to daily source code 549, you said the Bowie song was from 1975, the year

244
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:50,820
of my birth and it was 22 years ago, although I often wish I was 22, I am in fact 31 until

245
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,820
September 2nd.

246
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,460
Hey, I'm my birthday, September 3rd.

247
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:08,180
Karen, I'm an idiot, I'm an idiot, and I can't count, sorry about the, it's something

248
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:18,660
we have, it's unbelievable, hey Adam, Chef Mark here, and you got me so excited talking

249
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,100
about David Bowie, you know, I am one of the all-time figures, David Bowie fans of all,

250
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:28,460
and in fact, what you're hearing underneath here is the first live performance of sound

251
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:35,060
and vision, and your statement got me to thinking about the release date of 75, and I'm

252
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:41,220
looking back on his whole dysagraphy, and actually, unfortunately, no, that's not true.

253
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,540
Sounded vision was released as a single with a B-side, a new career in a new town in January

254
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:53,580
477, and the album low came out January 14th, 1977, and you might be thinking of some

255
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,340
of the stuff from David Live, which was released in 75.

256
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:05,460
Hold on a second, hold on a second, Chef Mark, you are surprising me, did you hear that?

257
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,260
It's like this is the Chef Mark who's always sending in recipes and a little dainty stuff

258
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:17,060
to impress chicks with, and he's like totally in a bowie, and he's like rattling

259
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,060
off all this information.

260
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,660
All right, you're incorrect, it was an undies, and you know, I was thinking about maybe

261
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,340
I was incorrect, perhaps it was the Detroit Spinner's rubber band man, which was the

262
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:32,540
other single I had as my first 245, maybe that was from 75, but I really, really, really

263
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,020
think it was possible that maybe it was 75 in Europe, is that possible, and that you're

264
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,860
looking at a US release, Chef Mark.

265
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,260
He did a lot of sort of life things, it was a mix of a lot of the old stuff from Diamond

266
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,260
Dogs and some of the new stuff he was working on, you're going into the Young American

267
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,260
Space.

268
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,340
In any case, you know, this album low was really a groundbreaking album, Brian Eno and

269
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:00,420
Robert Fripp were instrumental on this album, and I got an interesting little clip to

270
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,140
read to you from about the story of the song Sound Envision.

271
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,900
A reggae style whack on a choke symbol, offsets the little team beat the characterizes

272
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,980
the hit theme from this unnervingly unpredictable sequence of songs.

273
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,380
His bowies concessioned two words, after several bars of Alomar guitar riffing, interspersed

274
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:25,220
by that old familiar detuned bowie's sax.

275
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,220
So that part where he just sang, is probably he's probably thinking about the sign that

276
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,980
flashes on and off in BBC TV studios, or at least did in the days of Muffin the Mule,

277
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,220
early gig, and what's my line.

278
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,980
Interestingly enough, in 1977 this was picked up by the BBC and used as background music

279
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,860
during announcements for a while, probably at the behest of Alan, Crack to actor Yentong,

280
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,060
he's the guy who he wrote that song about.

281
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,500
What this song says is simple, you don't need to write a triple concept album about mutant

282
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,420
graphs or pploids to maintain a life in pop.

283
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,500
You can mutter a few words, sing along to a silly tune that could be a nursery rhyme, and

284
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,300
still get a hefty advance.

285
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,140
Blue, blue electric blue, that's a color of my room where I will live Sims Bowie,

286
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,580
peeping out from behind the net curtains, and making himself a nice cup of tea.

287
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,420
You know, joins in on the vocals here, together with Mary Visconti, better known to pop

288
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,060
pickers as Mary Hopkins.

289
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,500
There are still no signs of the much-funted, oblique strategies at work, only a bow

290
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,820
in the direction of 50s duo, tune-wise, that is.

291
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,260
This was a big hit that everyone was looking for, and that description comes from the book

292
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,980
we could be heroes, the stories behind every David Bowie song.

293
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:38,300
This David Bowie moment brought to you by the culinary podcast network with Chef Mark.

294
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:43,260
Hey, surprise me dude, really, totally blown away by that.

295
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
Nice.

296
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,700
Now we have some more things in common.

297
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,940
I actually hook an up with Chef Mark in two weeks in New York, Ron and I are going

298
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,540
to do a New York trip, so looking forward to that.

299
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:58,060
I was, I don't know what the hell I was going to talk about now.

300
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,860
Hold on, what's this?

301
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,860
I'm just looking at my Google node pad.

302
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
That's some biodiesel style.

303
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,020
I'm going to save all that for tomorrow.

304
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:12,100
And by the way, the developer and 800 for the Trinity developers, and I have received

305
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:19,540
a couple of requests for SSH access, which means some geeks want to enter my ports, and I'm

306
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,940
going to open them.

307
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,140
I'm going to open my ports.

308
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,820
Why, for you, boys?

309
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,860
Is the couple devices and the navkits and the world license, and I don't know all

310
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,860
this stuff?

311
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:39,060
Of course, was immediately sent from Finland, and is being held up in Texas at customs.

312
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,060
Of course.

313
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,500
So it may be another day or two.

314
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,780
I think another set is being sent from New York.

315
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,740
And you know, you guys don't mess around, man, when they commit to something, they're

316
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,740
really commit to something.

317
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,540
Hey, Adam, it's Mark.

318
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:01,140
Just goofing around my guitar here on my lunch break.

319
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,820
And I got another solo for you.

320
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,300
This one sent in by Chip from the top of the pod saves podcast.

321
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:14,900
Now did you know that the very first guitar solo came on July 2nd, 1863, on the eve

322
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,500
after the first day of fighting at the Battle of Gettysburg, when Corporal Leonard Spanky

323
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,620
McPatterson, noodleed around on his sixth drink for about 20 minutes when he couldn't

324
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,140
remember the 2nd verse to O Susanna.

325
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,540
And an art form was born.

326
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,100
Unfortunately, Spanky took a musket ball to the head the next day, and really didn't

327
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,540
develop it much.

328
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,180
But that, of course, did not stop Chip from top of the pod saves podcast from sending

329
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,180
his solo.

330
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,180
Let's check it out.

331
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:33,180
Pretty cool, Chip, and for those of you keeping Scott home, Chip says that he was using

332
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:39,580
his smash-o-blaster, piece of shit, Red Strat Squire that he modified with some cool pick-up,

333
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:44,660
see more dug-in live wire pick-ups, a Wilkinson Whammy bar, and a graphite nut.

334
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,820
And for those of you who've never had a graphite nut before, let me just dial you.

335
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,820
You have no idea what you're missing.

336
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,820
So there you go, Adam.

337
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,580
There's your guitar solo of the week, thanks to Chip from the top of the pod saves

338
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,580
podcast.

339
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,580
Right on.

340
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,580
And if you're a sixth drink slinger, a shredder, a jazz head, whatever, you play the guitar,

341
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,580
show us your chops.

342
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:09,540
We want to hear your guitar solo, because the guitar solo is a dying art form.

343
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,540
And let's pump some life into it, okay?

344
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:19,540
So send your guitar solo to House of Tone, all one word, House of Tone at gmail.com.

345
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,540
Catch you later, Adam.

346
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,540
You nutty bastard you.

347
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,540
Don't change a thing.

348
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,540
Yeah.

349
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,540
Except maybe you're underwear.

350
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,540
Yeah, okay.

351
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,540
Catch you later.

352
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,540
Okay.

353
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,540
Oh, no, this has happened a while.

354
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,540
Sometimes the universe comes together, and the timing is just perfect.

355
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,540
Hey, the other sad life repair man's coming after you.

356
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,540
Sad life repair man, what's he gonna do?

357
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,540
He'll fix your misconceptions and answer questions too.

358
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,540
There's nothing in the universe, and he can't do for you.

359
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,540
Sad life repair man.

360
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,540
Sad life repair man.

361
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,540
I have body, I'm serious.

362
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,540
SM, I guess we'll call SM radio now.

363
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,540
What is up with that merger?

364
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,540
Ah, well, we're New York, rest assured.

365
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,540
I'm gonna go talk to the brass.

366
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
He was going on.

367
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,540
Haven't received any other memos.

368
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,540
Other than you will be rich beyond your wildest dreams for sure.

369
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,540
I remember all of a sudden what I was going to tell you,

370
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
House of Tupid was on during the shakes.

371
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,540
I went and got that book that I've been reading on the plane.

372
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,540
I picked it up at the airport.

373
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,540
It's my Francis Wien.

374
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,540
Wien.

375
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,540
Whiskey hotel echo echo November.

376
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,540
How mumbo jumbo conquered the world?

377
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,540
And I have to say, this is my kind of book.

378
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,540
I'll just read the the back here.

379
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,540
Uh, because this is kind of what the book is about.

380
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,540
What colonized the space recently vacated by notions of history,

381
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,540
progress, and reason?

382
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,540
Cults, quackery, gurus, irrational panics, new age,

383
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,540
mysticism, moral confusion, and an epidemic of mumbo jumbo.

384
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,540
Francis Wien evokes the key personalities of the post-political era,

385
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,540
including Princess Diana and Deepak Chopra,

386
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,540
of Solomon Bin Laden and Nancy Reagan's astrologer,

387
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,540
while charting the extraordinary rise in superstition,

388
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,540
voodoo economics, and emotional hysteria over the past quarter of a century.

389
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,540
And it is my kind of book.

390
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:28,540
He gives a lot of history about the whole rise of motivational speakers

391
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,540
and self-help books.

392
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,540
And I'm only halfway through the book.

393
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,540
I'm not quite sure if I want to endorse the book yet.

394
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,540
If you should go buy it, I'm only about halfway through.

395
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,540
And I've to admit the chapter I'm on,

396
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,540
which is the demolition merchants of reality,

397
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,540
is a tough one.

398
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,540
Oh, my head was bobbing in the plane and like,

399
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,540
ah, let's maybe I should watch some mighty boos instead.

400
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,540
Hello, Adam Duke in Portland, Oregon,

401
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,540
home to your friend, Kenster Jay.

402
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,540
Oh, yes.

403
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,540
Portland, Oregon, haven't been there in a while.

404
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,540
And I really must go visit Kenster Jay.

405
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,540
In fact, as my mind is starting to warp around

406
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,540
the free Trinity project.

407
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,540
I'm thinking maybe, maybe,

408
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,540
I drive her up north first.

409
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,540
Portland,

410
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:18,540
I think I need to go to Seattle.

411
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,540
I would be great to roll up into Kenster Jay's driveway.

412
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,540
Anyway, back to the audio comment.

413
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,540
And I have two comments for you on two different segments.

414
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,540
The first one for your posh of people's segment.

415
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,540
Okay.

416
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,540
I think you can expand this a little bit.

417
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,540
I don't think posh people are just only potty pigs,

418
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,540
but as an airline employee,

419
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,540
I noticed that they're also packing pigs.

420
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,540
They seem to have the biggest bags

421
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,540
that I've ever seen in my life.

422
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,540
Well, you know, of course,

423
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,540
because Mark Jacobs says so,

424
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,540
you have to have the big bag.

425
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,540
You know better than to ask that.

426
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,540
You know, if I was the cherries for a while,

427
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,540
but screw that through the cherries out.

428
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,540
You're absolutely right.

429
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,540
Posh people have,

430
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
you know,

431
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
and not just,

432
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,540
are they packing pigs,

433
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,540
but there's tremendous synergy.

434
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,540
So no, a symbol,

435
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,540
no, they have matching luggage.

436
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,540
You know, you just can't cut it these days,

437
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,540
unless you've got to matching Louis Vuitton luggage.

438
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,540
I agree.

439
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,540
So,

440
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,540
they're taking up space.

441
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,540
These posh people by overpacking.

442
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,540
And they're potty pigs.

443
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,540
Mh.

444
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,540
Death to them all, I say.

445
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,540
Possibly be packing this amount of these posh destinations,

446
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
but they're going to.

447
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,540
It's unbelievable.

448
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
One bag, you know,

449
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,540
70 pounds of stuff,

450
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,540
knows.

451
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,540
The second segment is for free kind of these.

452
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,540
Hopefully,

453
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,540
Trinity can make it a beautiful portland organ.

454
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,540
We have a number of fabulous biodiesel facilities,

455
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,540
and hopefully come to find out,

456
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,540
home to a biodiesel processing facility

457
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,540
that can be a river.

458
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,540
So maybe Trinity can make a trip up to Portland,

459
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,540
and we can take her around the town.

460
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,540
Hope that would work out,

461
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,540
and hopefully enough folder and scruncher,

462
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,540
and being an airline employee,

463
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
hope retail wins,

464
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,540
or it's not being appropriate for me.

465
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,540
We'll talk to you later.

466
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,540
No, of course not.

467
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,540
It's completely appropriate for you.

468
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,540
Absolutely.

469
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,540
Tail wins to you, my friend.

470
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,540
Yeah, I heard that somewhere

471
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
of North,

472
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,540
I was reading it earlier.

473
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,540
I don't have the link handy,

474
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,540
that a biodiesel company got

475
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,540
to $214 million in venture capital,

476
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,540
I think,

477
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,540
to start producing more.

478
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,540
It's fantastic.

479
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,540
Yeah, I'm going to try and do that definitely.

480
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,540
And let us know what airlines you fly for.

481
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,540
And are you flight attendant?

482
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,540
Are you a cabin crew?

483
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,540
No.

484
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,540
Are you cabin crew?

485
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,540
Do you put the yellow door selectors to automatic?

486
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,540
Or are you on the flight deck?

487
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,540
And querying minds need to know my friend.

488
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,540
Hi, Adam.

489
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,540
This is Norman again,

490
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,540
from the German normcast and pod parade podcast.

491
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
Hey,

492
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,540
I couldn't talk.

493
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,540
We get it.

494
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,540
A few months ago,

495
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,540
you played the audio feedback that I did together.

496
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,540
Oh,

497
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
Wachter, I'm Mal.

498
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,540
I,

499
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
I've been in,

500
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,540
sits in Pinkler.

501
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
With you,

502
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,540
from the German podcast cafe,

503
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,540
in your daily source code episode number 452.

504
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,540
We were explaining the problem that podcasters

505
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,540
outside the USA might have.

506
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,540
If they play songs from well-known artists

507
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,540
listed in the PMN in their shows,

508
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
because these artists are often signed

509
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,540
to the different versions of BMIS cap

510
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
in other countries,

511
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
like,

512
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,540
for example,

513
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
Gamma,

514
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
Stemera,

515
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
Swisa,

516
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
and so on.

517
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
The result of this audio feedback being played

518
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,540
in your show was a discussion

519
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,540
in several forums here in Germany,

520
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,540
so it had a positive effect.

521
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,540
But unfortunately,

522
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,540
no problem has been solved since then.

523
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,540
The authorities and organizations

524
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,540
such as the Gamma are moving very slowly

525
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,540
if they move at all.

526
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,540
They sometimes remind me of a big old dinosaur.

527
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,540
In one of your last episodes,

528
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,540
you mentioned the possibility that the PMN

529
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
might come to Germany as well.

530
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
Hold on a second.

531
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
First of all,

532
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,540
let me just summarize what the issue was here.

533
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,540
Unlike the United States with ASCAP BMI,

534
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,540
you can hand out a special license

535
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,540
to anyone you damn will please

536
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,540
to let them play your music.

537
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,540
You could hand away this right

538
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,540
to play a song on a podcast.

539
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,540
And there's another right associated with it

540
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
for the download.

541
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,540
But just when it comes to performing rights

542
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
organizations,

543
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,540
which is what he's talking about here.

544
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,540
And in many other countries,

545
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,540
and in Germany as well,

546
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,540
once you sign up with an organization

547
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,540
that represents your performance rights,

548
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,540
you do not have that right

549
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,540
to give another special license to anyone else.

550
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,540
So it's very confusing.

551
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,540
And although I think you probably be okay,

552
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,540
and I think you guys have figured it out.

553
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
The conversation is good.

554
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,540
And eventually the D.J.M.A.

555
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,540
and Stemrah,

556
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,540
and all those guys, the Lemrah,

557
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,540
the Nimrod,

558
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,540
they should definitely adjust their laws or bylaws.

559
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,540
Now, this is interesting for us

560
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,540
because you and myself and other podcasts

561
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,540
are playing a huge amount of

562
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,540
hopefully pot-safe music

563
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,540
in our shows,

564
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,540
and we have made nice contacts

565
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,540
to several artists and bands so far.

566
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,540
This is just one more thing.

567
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,540
I didn't say the PMN

568
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,540
was coming to Germany,

569
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
Germany,

570
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,540
but Podshow,

571
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,540
Podshow may be coming to Germany.

572
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,540
We want to go on with it.

573
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,540
Now, we have got a new phenomenon coming up,

574
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,540
which reminded me a little bit of the Arctic monkeys.

575
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,540
They became famous overnight,

576
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,540
and weren't pot-safe anymore.

577
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,540
I don't think they really were,

578
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
and they've never on the pot-safe music network.

579
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,540
I believe they exploded through my space.

580
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,540
I think you're a lot of conflicting information about that.

581
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,540
By the way, your English dude is fantastic.

582
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,540
Absolutely impeccable.

583
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,540
Podparate.de,

584
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,540
the Pot-safe music charts here in Germany,

585
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,540
there was a song that went out of the charts

586
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,540
with the last episode.

587
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,540
It had to,

588
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,540
because every song can only be positioned

589
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,540
for another eight times after its new entry.

590
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,540
We do this because we want to keep the charts fresh

591
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,540
in a way.

592
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,540
A young band from the USA called Rock Kills Kit

593
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,540
did a great song called Parallelized,

594
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
and by the way,

595
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,540
the whole album,

596
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,540
which is called IU nervous,

597
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,540
is brilliant.

598
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,540
This song,

599
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,540
which sounds a bit like the early U2,

600
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,540
has been our number one for several times,

601
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,540
and it is the most successful record in the pot-parate so far.

602
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,540
For me personally,

603
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,540
it's the best song of the year 2006.

604
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
And now,

605
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,540
the band has appeared in the Gima database,

606
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,540
and they have a contract with Warner Music.

607
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,540
The CD is announced,

608
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
for example,

609
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,540
at Amazon DE,

610
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,540
as brand new,

611
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,540
which it isn't,

612
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,540
and it will be re-released

613
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,540
with the beginning of March 2007.

614
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,540
The song is played on some normal radio stations,

615
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,540
now,

616
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,540
and there it is always announced as brand new.

617
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,540
No,

618
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
no,

619
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,540
no,

620
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
no,

621
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,540
I've played it in my own show

622
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,540
for the first time in August 2006.

623
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,540
The problem now is that many people

624
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,540
who have played that song also in their podcast shows,

625
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,540
are now wondering if they have to take these particular episodes

626
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,540
of their own shows from the internet

627
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,540
in order not to eventually violate some laws.

628
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,540
We,

629
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,540
who are doing the pot-parate,

630
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
will not do so,

631
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,540
because we think that these episodes

632
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,540
were legal and correct when they were recorded.

633
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Because you're really mad at that song,

634
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,540
that's what I realized.

635
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,540
So,

636
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,540
this is another thing that has to be looked after in the near future,

637
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,540
I think.

638
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,540
Thanks for the attention, Adam,

639
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,540
regards to all your listeners,

640
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,540
and keep up the good work,

641
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,540
including playing the Beatles in your show.

642
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,540
It was really great.

643
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,540
And the next time,

644
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,540
you come to Germany,

645
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,540
hopefully there'll be a chance for us to meet you.

646
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
Bye for now.

647
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,540
I thank you.

648
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
Choose.

649
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,540
I would very much like that.

650
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,540
Absolutely.

651
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,540
And I think,

652
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,540
you know,

653
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,540
maybe you shouldn't overanalyze it all that much.

654
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,540
I'm sure it's okay.

655
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
I really am.

656
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,540
And I'm sure that the law,

657
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,540
it's just a text time to change laws.

658
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,540
I don't know if anyone who's gotten into trouble

659
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:02,540
for playing something that has showed up in a gamma database,

660
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,540
all of a sudden.

661
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:08,540
And I think you're right to just continue to play Rock Hills kid.

662
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,540
In fact,

663
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,540
if anything,

664
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
you know,

665
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,540
Rock Hills kid should go to bat for you.

666
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,540
They should be kissing your archlock for helping him out.

667
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,540
You know what I'm saying?

668
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,540
Let's see what it's all about.

669
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,540
No way.

670
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,540
In that gamma database.

671
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,540
Rock Hills kid.

672
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,540
Rock Hills kid.

673
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,540
Rock Hills kid.

674
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,540
Rock Hills kid.

675
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,540
Rock Hills kid.

676
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,540
Rock Hills kid.

677
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,540
Rock Hills kid.

678
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,540
