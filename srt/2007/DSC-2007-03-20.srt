1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Dude! Yeah, what's up? Did you see that chick I was with last night? She was smoking.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:17,400
Yeah, she gave me your number. Yeah, I got it right here. D.S.C. 5.6.5. Oh man, she left a number off.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,200
Don't know, that's what she wrote. D.S.C. 5.6.5. Who? Adam Curry? Yeah, big-haired fag, pink glasses,

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:34,000
jumpsuit. Yeah, I remember him. Here's no Kurt Loder, but I know who he is. A podcast, daily source code.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,400
Oh man, that sucks! Ah, she was a skank anyway. D.S.C. 5.6.5.5. My ass.

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Let's say two heads are better than one, and with this angel from above, there's nothing that they both can't do.

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:13,200
I make you wildest dreams come true, to grab your ear buds and jam a man.

8
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,200
I let the fabulous show begin. It's Adam and Patricia.

9
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Yes, Adam and Patricia. Adam and the lady Patricia. Adam Curry was just a guy with big-haired,

10
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:38,200
who sold his first company and thought he'd just kick back and take it easy, but he never counted on this.

11
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Adam and Patricia, the king and queen of the manner, or just the lady and the tramp.

12
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Only on the daily source code.

13
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Some folks like to get away, taking holiday from the neighborhood.

14
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Half a flight to Miami Beach, or a Hollywood.

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:54,200
When I'm taking a play hand, on a Hudson River line, I'm in a New York state of mind.

16
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:10,200
I've seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines.

17
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm in a New York state of mind.

18
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,200
It was so easy, never, day by day.

19
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:52,200
I got a touch with the river my blues.

20
00:03:52,200 --> 00:04:03,200
But now I need a little, give out and take the New York time.

21
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:19,200
It comes down to reality and it's fine with me because I've let it slide.

22
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Don't care if it's Chinatown, or run from the side.

23
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,200
I don't have any reason.

24
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Let them all be high.

25
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm in a New York state of mind.

26
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:31,200
It was so easy, never, day by day.

27
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:39,200
I got a touch with the river my blues.

28
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:50,200
But now I need a little, give out and take the New York time.

29
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:59,200
The daily news won't.

30
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,200
It comes down to reality and it's fine with me because I've let it slide.

31
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Don't care if it's Chinatown, or run from the side.

32
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,200
I don't have any reason.

33
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,200
I left them for me high.

34
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm in a New York state of mind.

35
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,200
I'll just take a day out.

36
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:51,200
But now I need a little, give out and take the New York time.

37
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:58,200
It was so easy, never, day by day.

38
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:07,200
I'm in a New York state of mind.

39
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:28,200
I have to go to jail for your pleasure like that.

40
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:46,200
I took it off of iTunes and then I re-recorded it to get rid of the digital rights management

41
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:53,200
and then put it back in the cast blast and it sounded shitty.

42
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:03,200
It's the lady Patricia in the attic.

43
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:14,200
It is so good to have you back on the show.

44
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:29,200
You put me in my place, I think that's what people like the most.

45
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,200
That's a real long time.

46
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
How are you doing?

47
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
I'm doing good as you know.

48
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,200
I came back from Holland.

49
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
I was in San Francisco for eight days, something like that.

50
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Then I came back for a week and I left to New York.

51
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,200
I came back and it was the first thing I said when I saw you.

52
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
My God, you look good.

53
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Exactly.

54
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
It's this dancing.

55
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Because what did I do?

56
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I don't know.

57
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
What did you do?

58
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
What was his name?

59
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Well, Carl.

60
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Carl, you have that nice freshly fucked face.

61
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Yes.

62
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
No, what I did was I trained a lot and I danced.

63
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
I'm still dancing.

64
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
The dancing is doing wonders for you.

65
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I believe it is absolutely.

66
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
And it's fun.

67
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
It's fun.

68
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Because actually going to the gym, I don't like that.

69
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
It's too boring.

70
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
It's very boring.

71
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
That's why I don't go because it's stings and it's boring.

72
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
And I'm so disgusted.

73
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
And they don't let you smoke your spliff while you're working out.

74
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
That's right.

75
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
It's a real bummer.

76
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,200
But also, you're touching everything you're sitting in somebody else's sweat.

77
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
But sweat, no less.

78
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Oh, I hate that.

79
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Yeah, that's a good point.

80
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
I like to be outside.

81
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,200
So I'm doing my walk, which is very convenient here across the road.

82
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Which is, of course, because we moved that area across the street is wonderful.

83
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Yeah.

84
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,200
For, for walking, for power, walk is going up.

85
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
It's the shantry woods.

86
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
It's very good.

87
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Yes, the shantry woods.

88
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Yes.

89
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
And it's a mountain.

90
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
So you have to go up.

91
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
A mountain.

92
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
It's like a hill.

93
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
It's not really a mountain.

94
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
It's a mountain.

95
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
It feels like a mountain.

96
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
For Dutch people that may be a mountain.

97
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
It's a hill.

98
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
It's a hill.

99
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
And so that's very good.

100
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,200
And then I have weekly, which is actually tonight.

101
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Right.

102
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
I have my dance class.

103
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
I have got to see this.

104
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
These people in the, like, the tight latex suits and the really stuff.

105
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
No, no, no, no.

106
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
No, no.

107
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
There's nobody actually.

108
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
There are some people.

109
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Other people rehearsing.

110
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
But it's just me and my teacher.

111
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
I know.

112
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
But what is he wearing?

113
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
No, he's wearing, uh, blue jeans.

114
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Soft, dancing shoes.

115
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Uh-huh.

116
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,200
And, uh, sort of, very hugging kind of a, um, black.

117
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Like her.

118
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Like her.

119
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Like her.

120
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Is it like her?

121
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Yeah, exactly.

122
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Yeah.

123
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
And he is, he is younger than I am.

124
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
I have to say that.

125
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
But he looks older, probably.

126
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Uh, I'm not going to say.

127
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
You know.

128
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
You never know.

129
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
It's not delicious.

130
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
I never know who's listening.

131
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
But he's, he's very nice.

132
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
And we have, it's, it's again, I have a lot of fun.

133
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Well, baby, it becomes you completely.

134
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Because, um, now, not that your butt has ever looked big or anything like that.

135
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Let me just, just claim this right up front.

136
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
No, I never had a bit.

137
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

138
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
But he's even smaller.

139
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Well, no, but it, the, everything is contracted.

140
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
You know, so you would, you would just more woman.

141
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
And it's contracted a little bit.

142
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
And now you are pretty, I'd say you're close to, uh, when you were 38.

143
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Really?

144
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
No, but doesn't make you feel good if I say that.

145
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Come on.

146
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Go on.

147
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Go on.

148
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Yes, tell me.

149
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Oh, so I come back.

150
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
You know, it's like, uh.

151
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
We women like that.

152
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
I know.

153
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
I say that.

154
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
That's why I'm saying it.

155
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
So I'm doing it for you.

156
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
No, I know.

157
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
You're, no, for you.

158
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
For all other men of the world.

159
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
I don't think that.

160
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Yeah, it looks great.

161
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
It really does.

162
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Thank you.

163
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
So I come back, uh, what's Saturday?

164
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Yeah.

165
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Saturday from New York.

166
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Yeah.

167
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
And we have one day.

168
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
And of course, I'm completely messed up on that.

169
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
The time really messed with me this time.

170
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I'm gonna left you, okay.

171
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Yeah, then you left, man.

172
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,200
At this time, difference, you know, the, the US of A, uh,

173
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
changed, uh, to daylight savings time.

174
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,200
A whole month before the rest, before the rest of the world,

175
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
to, uh, it was part of what, uh, part of, uh,

176
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,200
the administration's energy saving plan, which I believe kind of makes sense.

177
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Uh, to give us an extra month of, uh, of more daylight,

178
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
therefore, yes, like less electricity being used.

179
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Yeah.

180
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,200
That made the difference between New York and London four hours,

181
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
which was really weird because I felt like I was near you,

182
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
but I wasn't near you.

183
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
And it was still, you know, just those four hours

184
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
and by the time I got involved.

185
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
We can feel worse.

186
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Oh, man.

187
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Yeah.

188
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
It does.

189
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
One hour can feel worse than then eight hours.

190
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
It's unbelievable.

191
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Yeah.

192
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Yeah.

193
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Yeah.

194
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
So, uh, anyway.

195
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Uh, this oriented, and then you laughed.

196
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
You, you went away.

197
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Yes.

198
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
So what did you do?

199
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I went to my friend, uh,

200
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,200
uh, Paul Schult, who is, uh, a fashion designer.

201
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Oh, yes.

202
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Oh, it's good to hear.

203
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Oh, it's good to hear.

204
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Let me guess.

205
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
And is he gay?

206
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
One of the best.

207
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Very gay, but so sweet.

208
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
I love that.

209
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
You know, that's so wonderful.

210
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
And he loves women.

211
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Mm-hmm.

212
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
And he designs for women.

213
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
And, uh,

214
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I'm always, um,

215
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
in the first part of, um,

216
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
trying to get a whole show together.

217
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
And then think with him and with him.

218
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,200
And we, we sort of, uh, a team together.

219
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Yeah.

220
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
You know, where we, um,

221
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
You come up with a thing that we're,

222
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
and these are the shows.

223
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
You know, these are real productions.

224
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
I mean, this is, uh,

225
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
real like Hollywood style productions.

226
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Yeah.

227
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Big.

228
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
It's big stuff.

229
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
So I've already got the next one.

230
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I do the Dutch designers, um,

231
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
do their fashion shows,

232
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
either weeks before or weeks after,

233
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
like the rest of the world,

234
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
like Paris, New York.

235
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Well, that's when you, I don't get it.

236
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
No, I don't know.

237
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
That's, it seems really wrong to me.

238
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Yeah.

239
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm not a fashion guru, but it seems like.

240
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
But they all do it.

241
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Yeah.

242
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Maybe.

243
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
I don't know.

244
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
They're not even, I think,

245
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
looking at what the other designers are doing.

246
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
They're doing their own thing.

247
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
They have their own shorts.

248
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Sure.

249
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
So what can we expect?

250
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
A lot of famous and very wealthy clients.

251
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
So for to spring 2007,

252
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
what should we be wearing at Lady Patricia?

253
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
What is going to be in?

254
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
And I'm not talking about what the Dutch designers are saying,

255
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
but what is the,

256
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
the world of fashion at large say?

257
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
I, you know what?

258
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Those panties you had on,

259
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
yes, that they were pretty fashionable.

260
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
They're cute.

261
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Mm, very cute.

262
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
The whole set with the bra.

263
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Very, very.

264
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Very Brigitte Bardau.

265
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Very Brigitte Bardau.

266
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I couldn't wait to rip them off.

267
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Very.

268
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Very in and big, big, especially the, the bags.

269
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
The bags are huge.

270
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
The huge bags.

271
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I see bags carrying women around these days.

272
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
It's cool.

273
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
You and your bags.

274
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Yeah.

275
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
It's out of control.

276
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Carl Agafald calls him the La Grande sack.

277
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Yeah.

278
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Well, I've got a La Grande sack for you right here.

279
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Listen.

280
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
This, this.

281
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
This bag thing.

282
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
It's out of control.

283
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
It's very, this.

284
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
You know, the more expensive.

285
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
I feel this is porn for women.

286
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,200
So it's almost like we've now gone into the, uh, into the double D territory.

287
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,200
You know, it's like, uh, now all sudden it's hot to have really, you know,

288
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
porn with really big boobs.

289
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
And this is crazy.

290
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Yeah.

291
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
This, I mean, these bags are way too big.

292
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
What are you coming from boobs to boobs?

293
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
No, no, no.

294
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Bags are porn for women.

295
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Yes.

296
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
So porn for men.

297
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
We have trends, right?

298
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Right now it's very much, uh, she males are very trendy.

299
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Of course I, I like to think I set the trend.

300
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Yeah.

301
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
No, but seriously.

302
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Yeah.

303
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
But big boobs were, were a big, you know, big trend.

304
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Well, there's, there actually back because if you look at all the, the braziers and the bras,

305
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
they're self, they're full with, with stuff in there.

306
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Women are filling up their bras.

307
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
They're filling up their panties.

308
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Their butts are all safe.

309
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
They have big, big boobs.

310
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,200
I don't get that because it's going to be so disappointed if you take it.

311
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Exactly.

312
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
In the future, you know,

313
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Why would you fool yourself?

314
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
We're going to have like this, you know,

315
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,200
auto photoshop reality where women walk around in a haze of photoshop and they look beautiful.

316
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:21,200
And even kids, 15, 16 years old, even younger, all those little bras have those, those air bags in them.

317
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,200
And cur bags and silicone things and I think that's not good, is it?

318
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,200
But anyway, so I was back in Amsterdam.

319
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,200
And every time I'm there, all the photographers, all the photographers just,

320
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
How you know that?

321
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Run, how you love it.

322
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Because I'm never there.

323
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Finally, I'm there.

324
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
The queen has arrived.

325
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,200
So, you know, they took all those pictures and guess what happened?

326
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Because I was, I was actually a little bit of wearing a vest, a man's vest.

327
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
I saw it in the heart.

328
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,200
And I had a little white shirt on a neat open.

329
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Mm-hmm.

330
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,200
And you could see my very beautiful, clean, very neat, but, you know,

331
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Clevage.

332
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,200
So what happened was, I, I, I tear it.

333
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
No.

334
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
I tried to close it in suddenly, I tear it.

335
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
You tore it.

336
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Yeah.

337
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
So it was a, a big tear.

338
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
It was a big tear.

339
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
And I tore it.

340
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
It was a big, no you tore it.

341
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
You tore it and you had a big tear.

342
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Yeah.

343
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,200
So then, you know, all the, all the photographers,

344
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Oh yeah, they loved that.

345
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Oh yeah, they loved that.

346
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
The photographers started to,

347
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Perhaps, no common, perhaps not.

348
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
That's what they call here, paparazzi, the paparazzi.

349
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
The paparazzi.

350
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
The paparazzi.

351
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
So started to flash, of course.

352
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Of course, did anything top out?

353
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
God.

354
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
They needed a white angle length.

355
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
I have to say.

356
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
They popped out.

357
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Now, not, not really with a nipple, but you can see a lot of brass.

358
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Yeah.

359
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
That's something closer to any more.

360
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
So that was a nice moment.

361
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Excellent.

362
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
I, I, I hope they're happy with it.

363
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
You know.

364
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
So did you, did you close that go?

365
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
I gave him something.

366
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
No, I couldn't.

367
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
I couldn't.

368
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,200
It was just, it was really, it was, I couldn't throw the way now.

369
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Right.

370
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Okay.

371
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
So that's what happened.

372
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
And so now tell me, are you going to be doing dancing with the stars again?

373
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
What's happening?

374
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
No.

375
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
No.

376
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
I didn't explain that last time.

377
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
So they were, when I did the, the special.

378
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
We're dancing with the stars.

379
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Yeah.

380
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Or the, you know, it's called here a strictly condense.

381
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Don't.

382
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
It's called dancing with the stars in the stage.

383
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Yeah.

384
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
I know.

385
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,200
So I did that special Christmas and New Year.

386
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,200
And, well, of course, it was, got a lot of attention.

387
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,200
And so the, the producer and the, what is it?

388
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
The broadcaster.

389
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Yeah.

390
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
The broadcaster.

391
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I said, would you like to do the real one?

392
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Right.

393
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Think about it.

394
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Yeah.

395
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Which, of course, is why you immediately went into training.

396
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Because you really wanted to get to mass secret training.

397
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
And keep that, you know, the vibe going.

398
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
And, and I was in good shape.

399
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
So, and I kept that up.

400
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,200
And they actually asked me twice.

401
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,200
And now I didn't hear anything anymore.

402
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
And I thought that's strange.

403
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
So now.

404
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Typical tellers.

405
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
But the girls, I spoke and I said, no, you know what?

406
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,200
They couldn't do it because they got the rules from the BBC.

407
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
There's a couple of rules.

408
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
And it is.

409
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Once you did the special, you cannot do the real one.

410
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Because you already are ahead of the other.

411
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
That's, that's the rules of the format before.

412
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Okay.

413
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Oh, that sucks.

414
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
So, and I said, it doesn't mean you can dance.

415
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
I only did two dances.

416
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
I don't know.

417
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Really?

418
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
But I want to try it.

419
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
And I'm not the youngest.

420
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
No.

421
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
No.

422
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
So, I think it's, it's a big deal.

423
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
But no.

424
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
No.

425
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
So that.

426
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
But I probably, I'm left lame.

427
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I might be a guest or anything.

428
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,200
And there were all kinds of, there were all kinds of rumors about you being a judge on

429
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
So you want to be a pop star.

430
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I mean, like, I read at least 20 different newspaper articles that said,

431
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Well, yeah, that's true.

432
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
They asked you for them.

433
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
They asked you for them.

434
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
They couldn't afford me.

435
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Okay.

436
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Dude, those other guys have it even fucking paid you from dancing with the stars.

437
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
That's true.

438
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
That sucks.

439
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Oh, man.

440
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
I hate that.

441
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
And you know, it's like now, and you can't go asking for it.

442
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Because if you, you were going to give it away.

443
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
It looks silly.

444
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Yeah.

445
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Because it's not that much.

446
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
But, you know, we could give it away for forever.

447
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
You were going to give it away.

448
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
You said, I want, it's like, it was like nothing.

449
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I want to give it to the animal.

450
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
It was like 1,500 bucks or something.

451
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
It's totally negative.

452
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
What it is, but they're still dead.

453
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Oh, I hate that.

454
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Oh, well, when they ask you for something else next time,

455
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,200
you tell them that you're, uh, your manager in a council wants to talk to us.

456
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Even the dancers.

457
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
They didn't get paid either.

458
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
No, the UK dances here.

459
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Get so much more.

460
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
But then there's a leverage.

461
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Hold on a second.

462
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Don't compare.

463
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Do not compare.

464
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
No, no, you can't.

465
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,200
You can't compare the UK market to the Dutch market.

466
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
The Dutch market.

467
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
There's like 2 million people watch a program.

468
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
You know, and here it's like 10 million.

469
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
So you can afford a lot more.

470
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
But still.

471
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
No, no still.

472
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
They, they spend a lot.

473
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
But on different things.

474
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Yeah.

475
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
They do spend a lot.

476
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
They just cock suckers.

477
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
They should, they should pay everyone.

478
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
I know these dancers don't get paid.

479
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
They're not paying.

480
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,200
They just go down and be begging for their money.

481
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
It's not that complicated.

482
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Everybody's complaining in Holland.

483
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
And I spoke to a lot of people that the the, um,

484
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
The quality of the, the, um,

485
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
The quality of the, of the shows and the program.

486
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Yeah, that's crap.

487
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Okay.

488
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
All right.

489
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Who gives it.

490
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Going bang down down.

491
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
All right.

492
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
I don't care anymore.

493
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
I don't live there.

494
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
And it's a pity.

495
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
It's because they don't want to pay.

496
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,360
me. I had my prize and they said no. Something completely different. Yeah. How about our garden?

497
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,480
Oh, isn't it? I took pictures. I put them up on the website. Yeah. Yeah, did you see them? Oh, man. They're awesome. No, I haven't.

498
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:46,600
Yeah, but no, actually they're almost done. That's why that's why. Yeah, to be fast. That's why Sunday when it was, was it Sunday? No,

499
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,920
yesterday Monday. No, I fuck. I don't remember Sunday, maybe. Yeah. It was so beautiful here. Look at this

500
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:02,200
and how does it smell when you open up those French doors of the dining room? It smells like heaven. It smells like spring.

501
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,280
I'm going to show you these pictures in the meantime. I got to play one little promo. There's something big

502
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:13,080
that's happening on what's today. Today is Tuesday on Thursday. Yeah. Big thing happened. Listen. Oh.

503
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,120
Hey, this is Neil from the Podsafe Revolution podcast. I'm sure you've already heard about this thing

504
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,200
called bum rush the charts. That tiny spark that is turned into a bonfire and is currently burning

505
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,160
up the Podsphere and the blogosphere. I'm sure you've already marked it on your calendars as well.

506
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:35,000
March 22nd, 2007, but this is a little reminder for those of you who are late to the party.

507
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:42,280
Here's what's going on. The whole premise is this. On March 22nd, 2007, that's this Thursday.

508
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,400
We're going to stand together to be counted. We'll put our collective dollars where our mouths are.

509
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,000
We'll take two minutes of our time and we'll purchase one song on one day in order to drive

510
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,680
that song to number one on iTunes. Now along the way, we'll be doing something positive for the world.

511
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,640
A world in which record labels think that Payola and Swedish pop songwriters are the only way to make

512
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,560
a difference. All proceeds from our iTunes affiliate link as well as 50% of the band's proceeds

513
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:14,360
will go towards providing money for a deserving college student to pursue higher education.

514
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,760
Now when we first started this little experiment in social media, the question was, will anyone care?

515
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,960
Well, not only has the online community joined our little Podsafe army, but big media has taken notice.

516
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,120
Bumrush the charts has been represented on the CBC, the BBC, wired blogs, the San Jose Mercury,

517
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:40,920
and now a little rag called billboard ever heard of it. The world is watching and our time is now.

518
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,720
On March 22, we ask you to join forces with us using the affiliate link found on bumrushthecharts.com,

519
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:55,960
purchase the song mine again by Black Lab and be a part of history. One day, one song, one voice,

520
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,880
number one on iTunes. Bumrushthecharts.com. I'm in. Are you?

521
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:09,720
So that's this Thursday. I told you about this, right? What we're doing?

522
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,840
Yeah. We're all going to buy it. That's wonderful. Yeah, so we chose Black Lab because they

523
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,880
were dropped from a major record label. And so now they're independent, they're on the Podsafe music network.

524
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,320
So everyone's going to say, go and buy this song to their audience. And of course,

525
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,040
you know, David Sorscott audience, a lot of them will buy it. It's 99 cents, but what happens is

526
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,040
we're going to show this song, move up the iTunes charts. You know, up until, you know,

527
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,360
where like Beyonce and all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we can show that there's actually a lot of

528
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,160
power and podcasting. Oh, that's good. Yeah, I thought it was a pretty great idea. No, great idea.

529
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:48,040
Yeah, it wasn't my idea. Oh, I hate to say. Okay. Yeah, but so that's Thursday. More about that tomorrow.

530
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:53,720
I'm obviously. Hey, great pictures. Don't you like him? Beautiful. Aren't they pretty? Very pretty.

531
00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:02,840
Thank you. I thought so, too. I don't want to keep you too long. So funny. It's like,

532
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,920
why not? Because I got to go. Oh, okay. It's like my grandfather used to say,

533
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,800
oh, lay down, take off the empanies, be out. Oh, well, you wouldn't be abused.

534
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:23,320
I've just been over the desk. I can't help it. I love with you. Oh, thank you.

535
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:29,800
I love in lust. I get butterflies in the stomach. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The butterflies are still there. Absolutely.

536
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:36,760
People getting nauseous now. I hope so. Yeah. No, women love that shit. Women love that.

537
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,520
When I, when I talked to him. How long are we having butterflies?

538
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,280
The Fox 20 years. Yeah. Twenty twenty-one years. And they're still fluttered. It was October

539
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,960
20 years ago that we came to the States together. Wow. Wow. It's a long time.

540
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,200
It's one big adventure with you, huh?

541
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,320
Emphasis on big.

542
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,320
You're the only woman I know who will make me wait up here in the studio.

543
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,200
Well, I'm coming. Yeah. I was like, well, what do you, would you please hurry up? Well, I'm putting

544
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,680
on my makeup. Is it? It's audio. It's like, it's almost like, um, what were you used to call

545
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:16,760
um, radio? I was like, you don't even make up for, oh, yeah, for this show. Yeah, well,

546
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,000
I wanted a good for you. Mm-hmm. Yeah, what you do.

547
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,720
For me. All right. So I got to go because I'm, uh, Ron and I'm meeting with Gavin. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

548
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,520
Gavin from our, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. We were in the dinner party. Oh, uh, and good looking

549
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:37,400
guy to say. Oh, pardon. Uh-huh. Well, no butterflies for him. No butterflies for Gavin. You sure

550
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:47,160
no. Not even a, a moth? No, no, no. I do have moth. No, no. Uh, I'm not blind. Of course. That's true. Not neither

551
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,680
my. Don't worry. Mm-hmm. I like to flirt in you, too. No, I don't flirt at all. Yes, you do. Yes, I do.

552
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,160
Very big flirt. I know you are. Emphasis on big. And that's good. Just keep it. You know,

553
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:03,640
makes you look good. Can you buy Tylenol PM here in the UK? No. So it doesn't exist because I was wondering

554
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,160
this yesterday. I told everyone that you want to try them out because it seems like the perfect thing

555
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:13,720
for women, uh, Tylenol PM sponsoring unwind and G. B's new show. Although I don't take a lot of

556
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,400
pain killers because I'm not in pain. But if, if you are, if you want to go to sleep, it's

557
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,040
nice. Exactly. And I suppose to take it every single day. I guess not. That could be moth or

558
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:29,480
back pain. But what I understood from you is that, um, well, women have more pain, aches and pains

559
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:37,080
regardless. Oh, we're one big pain. In the ass. Exactly. But that it's a perfect thing. Will you try it?

560
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:45,080
It's just, it's just painful to be woman. That's it. Sometimes it's hard to be a woman.

561
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,920
Give it all. What were you doing? Were you doing? Did you just want money? You guys have a little

562
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:58,120
bit of pain. Oh, then it's not, and then I need like a whole bottle. Oh, I bet headache. That's true.

563
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,840
I wanted to play something for you. I song the off the pod save music network. I want you to evaluate

564
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,840
this. I've played this a couple times. I know you don't listen to the show when you're not on.

565
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,400
No, I hear you the rest of the days. I know I'm, you know, you're one big pod show, don't

566
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,640
this is my husband, the pod show. I want to listen to this tell me what you think, but I thought it was

567
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:26,440
really good because guys got a big future. Pete Hopkins become from the pod save music network.

568
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:43,640
I wouldn't have it any other way. Life has a funny way. I think it's what they say. Yes,

569
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:51,960
what they say. Oh, surprising you each and every day. So let me sing this song

570
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:03,080
and I want to take more for the melody to wash over you and meet them. We can sing this song

571
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:16,120
as a day is long and let the melody set you free and it goes. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. There's a little more

572
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:28,920
to learn from every one. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, no one has had the answer over.

573
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:49,800
Just been not and become. Oh, yeah, so many things to do is a time and nothing ever

574
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:59,320
time and love. You need another year just to get it done. It's hard to overcome for

575
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:09,720
the love dreams. Yeah, live on dreams. But happy human still, we must become. So let me sing this song

576
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:20,760
and I want to take more for the melody to wash over you and meet them. We can sing this song

577
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:36,600
as a day is long and let the melody set you free and it goes. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. There's a little more to learn from every one.

578
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:47,480
La, la, la, la, la, la, no one has had the answers on their own.

579
00:30:50,760 --> 00:31:02,760
So we love this to be stronger. You can laugh away the pain, light again the listening to the

580
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:13,160
form of a sound, it's like a lullaby. Believe it or just leave it, but you don't know until you feel it.

581
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:34,120
And then we can sing this song and it won't feel wrong to let the melody wash over you.

582
00:31:50,760 --> 00:32:20,760
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la la, la la, la la, la la, la

583
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:43,660
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, las.

584
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,660
You like it, don't you?

585
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,660
Yeah, very mellow.

586
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,660
Every single time.

587
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,660
Very much in love.

588
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,660
Mm-hmm.

589
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,660
It reminds me a little bit of the Elessi Brothers kind of,

590
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,660
the vibe, not the singing or the song,

591
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,660
and it's kind of the happiness.

592
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,660
A sort of a Michael Jackson kind of a...

593
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
Yeah, that.

594
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
Yeah, that.

595
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,660
The vibrato thing.

596
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,660
Yeah, especially with the stop.

597
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,660
Yeah.

598
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,660
I love that.

599
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
I love that.

600
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
I love that.

601
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
I love that.

602
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,660
When the stop was there...

603
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
Like...

604
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,660
Quiet?

605
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,660
Did that remind you of anything?

606
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,660
How do you?

607
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,660
What?

608
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,660
Oh, oh.

609
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,660
On the heavy breeders, they always cold me.

610
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,660
No, whenever I play that song,

611
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,660
people write in, they love it.

612
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
This people often scoff.

613
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,660
Yeah, it's good.

614
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
It's good.

615
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,660
It's good.

616
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
Yeah, very nice.

617
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Beautiful. Nice, so harmonies.

618
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,660
So we kind of make up for the Billy Joel violation.

619
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,660
Yeah.

620
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,660
Make it show.

621
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,660
All right.

622
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,660
Will you promise to come on a little more often, baby?

623
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,660
Yes, of course.

624
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,660
Yeah, because...

625
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,660
There's so much that we haven't talked about

626
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,660
that I'm of course I'm going to remember

627
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,660
the minute after we're done with the show.

628
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
You want to discuss with me?

629
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
Yeah, we have to do it more often.

630
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Yeah, of course I want to discuss.

631
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,660
Oh, you have to be our consultant, you know,

632
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,660
on the cover girl stuff.

633
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
Okay.

634
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,660
We're going to do this.

635
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,660
Yeah, yeah.

636
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,660
Definitely need you to consult on that.

637
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,660
And if you wouldn't mind, could you please buy some

638
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,660
Folgers coffee and splendor.

639
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,660
They've splendid here, right?

640
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,660
Just not the...

641
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,660
Yes, yeah, the sugar.

642
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

643
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,660
No, it's not sugar.

644
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Splendid sugar, too.

645
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,660
Yeah, but it's not sugar.

646
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,660
Yeah, but it's not sugar.

647
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,660
Yeah, but it's not sugar.

648
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,660
Yeah, but it's not sugar.

649
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,660
Yeah, but it's not sugar.

650
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,660
Yeah, but it's not sugar.

651
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,660
Yeah, but it's not sugar.

652
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
Exactly.

653
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,660
No, that's not their slogan.

654
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
I know.

655
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660
Yeah.

656
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,660
Could you could because in America,

657
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,660
I'm always drinking Folgers and mixing with Splenda.

658
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,660
Yeah.

659
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,660
And I got nothing to talk about for the commercials.

660
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,660
Yeah, yeah.

661
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,660
I need to have it here.

662
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,660
You're Folgica.

663
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,660
I'm a L'Oréal girl.

664
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,660
You are a L'Oréal girl.

665
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,660
Yes.

666
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,660
For sure.

667
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,660
It's perfect.

668
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,660
I use it for years.

669
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,660
And I'm actually waiting.

670
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,660
But we're not getting paid for this.

671
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,660
What do you do?

672
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,660
I know, but I'm waiting for somebody to...

673
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,660
Oh, you're having a great offer.

674
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
Hey, L'Oréal.

675
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,660
I want to be in there.

676
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,660
In the commercials?

677
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,660
Who's doing it now?

678
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,660
And in McDonald, or no, she's not L'Oréal.

679
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,660
No, no, no.

680
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,660
Jane Fonda.

681
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,660
Jane Fonda.

682
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,660
Jane Fonda.

683
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,660
I don't like that commercial that she does.

684
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,660
No, no.

685
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,660
Yeah, you want to slap her.

686
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,660
Yeah, you don't want to buy it.

687
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,660
Yeah.

688
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,660
It's bad.

689
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,660
No, it should be more vital and hip.

690
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,660
Who else is doing it?

691
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,660
More trendy.

692
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,660
It's not you.

693
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,660
It's me.

694
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,660
Yes.

695
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,660
It's you.

696
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,660
Patricia.

697
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,660
Yes.

698
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,660
Of course.

699
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,660
I'm going to be 58.

700
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,660
I thought it wasn't allowed to say that.

701
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,660
I thought we weren't talking about your age.

702
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,660
Yeah, we're not saying it.

703
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,660
Seventh of April, we're going to be 58 too.

704
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,660
You want us to say 60.

705
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,660
I mean, that's it.

706
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,660
You're done.

707
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,660
You're toast.

708
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,660
As long as people, if you go in the street, yes.

709
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,660
Because we do that.

710
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,660
Christine and I do that now.

711
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
And she said, this is my mom.

712
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,660
How old do you think she is?

713
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,660
Yeah.

714
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,660
She's stupid.

715
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,660
It's not thinking.

716
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,660
You know, and the kid is saying, well, 35.

717
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,660
And I was like, oh, oh, oh.

718
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
I made my day.

719
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,660
Yes.

720
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,660
Would you like some dinner?

721
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,660
Come over to our house.

722
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,660
Still think I'm 35.

723
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,660
That's good.

724
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,660
Yeah, that's good.

725
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,660
And I'm a milk.

726
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,660
Yeah.

727
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,660
What else?

728
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,660
What else?

729
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,660
I got to show you this site called milkseeker.com.

730
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,660
Yeah.

731
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,660
It's unbelievable.

732
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,660
Guys take a camera.

733
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,660
It's don't really in.

734
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
Mils are totally.

735
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,660
I know.

736
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,660
But check it out.

737
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
So they take a camera.

738
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,660
They go into like a mall.

739
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,660
And they pick up mothers.

740
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,660
And they end up in the camera.

741
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,660
So they got this whole wrap of what we're doing.

742
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,660
A student film and blah, blah, blah.

743
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,660
And they get him in the car to their,

744
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,660
So mom's studio, which is nearby.

745
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,660
Which is the top.

746
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,660
What do you mean take off the top?

747
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,660
They fucking, they have sex with them.

748
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,660
No.

749
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,660
And like serious.

750
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,660
Two guys.

751
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,660
To go.

752
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,660
How old are they?

753
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,660
These mils?

754
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,660
No, the guys.

755
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,660
Oh, they're young.

756
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,660
Yeah.

757
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,660
Oh, they're good.

758
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,660
And one of them has a huge shwanshin sticker.

759
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,660
Not that I'm just writing.

760
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,660
I said, guys.

761
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,660
What do you got to go to California?

762
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,660
Really?

763
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Do all mothers dream about that?

764
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,660
I'm telling you, no, no, no.

765
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,660
Is it true?

766
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,660
So often you have these, I mean, you know, me.

767
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,660
I'm a porn official notto.

768
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,660
So so often you see these like the bang busts and all this stuff.

769
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,660
And you can tell that they're paid, right?

770
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,660
It's like, like, hookers walking on the street or porn actresses.

771
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,660
And you know, it's like an act.

772
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,660
But this, you can tell these women are not faking it.

773
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,660
It's real.

774
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,660
And the one for one, they all go with these.

775
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,660
I mean, I don't know how many they struck out.

776
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,660
You got to see it.

777
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,660
It is.

778
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,660
But I know it's going on because I see it when I walk in Guilford here.

779
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,660
The guys are really flirting with you.

780
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,660
You mean, Milford.

781
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,660
Milford.

782
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,660
Milford.

783
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,660
And Christina says to Mama, they love you.

784
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,660
They love your breasts.

785
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,660
They're looking at you.

786
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,660
And I think what's going on.

787
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,660
I know it's because women these days don't

788
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,660
Exude that sexual energy that women used to.

789
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,660
Yeah, but because now it's all like what we do.

790
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,660
It's like pumped up bras and fake butts and all that.

791
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,660
But you're real.

792
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,660
Yeah.

793
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,660
Oh, yeah.

794
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,660
Maybe that's it.

795
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,660
Maybe they're looking for the real thing.

796
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,660
And they know that those little kids are fake.

797
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,660
Maybe that's it.

798
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,660
Maybe.

799
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,660
I don't know what it is.

800
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,660
Maybe it's just a thing.

801
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,660
Very, very strange what's going on.

802
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,660
I can see it.

803
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,660
But it's true.

804
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,660
It is a milking milking milking.

805
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,660
In fact, I think the females are out and the milks are in for the spring.

806
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,660
Very much.

807
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,660
Very much.

808
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,660
That's the milky look.

809
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,660
Yeah, you are.

810
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,660
Yeah.

811
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,660
Amazing.

812
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,660
But very nice for our milks.

813
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,660
Milks united.

814
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,660
Yeah.

815
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,660
Yeah.

816
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,660
Yeah.

817
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,660
You're bad.

818
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,660
All right.

819
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,660
I've got to go to London on.

820
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,660
I've got to get out of here.

821
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,660
Right now.

822
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
So daily source code dot com.

823
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,660
Adam at pot show dot com.

824
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,660
Anything else you want to say to the other.

825
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,660
No, no.

826
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,660
Have a wonderful day.

827
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,660
Have a wonderful day.

828
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,660
It's going to be a bit cold, but.

829
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,660
Yeah.

830
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,660
Yeah.

831
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,660
That's right.

832
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,660
And between our legs.

833
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,660
It's somewhere else.

834
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,660
Yeah.

835
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,660
Thank you for coming on the show.

836
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,660
You're welcome, babe.

837
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,660
And see you again, maybe end of the week.

838
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,660
Yes.

839
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,660
Friday, maybe.

840
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,660
Let's do a Friday show.

841
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,660
A football Friday show.

842
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,660
You know what football means, don't you?

843
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,660
Yeah.

844
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,660
Football.

845
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,660
You don't know what football.

846
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,660
Football.

847
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,660
Do you know what football stands for?

848
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,660
F U B A R.

849
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,660
What was that?

850
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,660
Fucked up beyond all.

851
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,660
Oh, yeah.

852
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,660
Yeah.

853
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,660
God.

854
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,660
I'm so happy you listened to this show.

855
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,660
There's so many things.

856
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,660
If you actually explained it to me before.

857
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,660
If you actually listened.

858
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,660
You'd be horrified.

859
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,660
I'm sure.

860
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,660
Okay.

861
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,660
Yeah.

862
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,660
I believe it.

863
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,660
All right.

864
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,660
Thanks, baby.

865
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,660
I know you're saying awful thing.

866
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,660
But I'm not there.

867
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,660
Does anyone email you and say I can't believe what Adam said?

868
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,660
No.

869
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,660
I only speak.

870
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,660
Oh, you know.

871
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,660
I hear it all the whole day.

872
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,660
