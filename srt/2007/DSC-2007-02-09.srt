1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
As the world anxiously awaits, the CSD files prepare yourself for.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,400
Food bar Friday, food bar Friday, it's food bar Friday.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Demi Craig, I was trying to do the radio voice you ruined it.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,560
But it's food bar Friday, it's the DSC 543, Qosm Jersey Todd, Qosm Jeff Smith, AC hit the button.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,560
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,560
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,560
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,560
I'm just kidding, it's a matter of theory.

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,560
One hit, bring me out of the planet.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,560
There's a lot of time.

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,560
Hell oh, hello, halo, halo, that a roaring wing has been spitting the club.

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,560
Hell oh it all.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Hell oh, yellow.

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Hell oh, hey nooo, it all.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Hell, it all, hey nooo.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,560
Deep Ive untie quality.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
Deary Queen Community.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,560
And used butt circuit-fiat-deak-faj-stay-alop.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Tamara Skull carries his float deep, though.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Cloudnuts fill it away throw awaylag.

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Time is back my life to wreck down a dagegen-bound 10, man.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,860
Complete the list and start again

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:27,260
The greatest guy is a blue-er when I'm on my way

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,060
Ooh, just a black, black-dick taxi cap for you

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:42,060
Ooh, just a black, black-dick taxi cap for you

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,060
Ooh, just a black, black, black, black

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,060
I shot his horns and walked the cross, I was around modern

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,060
Makes it up and safety end, do not trust the night, it's creaming

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,560
Pull you up to you down again, like the lay, you life decay

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Wouldn't have any other way, yellow beige and bow tip

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,060
And a pleat the list and start again

32
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:11,760
The greatest guy is a blue-er when I'm on my way

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,920
Ooh, just a black, black dick, taxi cab new

34
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,920
Ooh, come back, taxi cab, quick, let's back for you

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,640
Ooh, shoot him back, you have what gotta do

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:40,800
Ooh, just a black, galactic taxi cab from you

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Yeah, hey, yellow page and fountain pen

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Complete the list and start again

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,800
The greatest guys of blue are when I'm on my way

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Ooh, just a black, galactic taxi cab from you

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Ooh, come back, taxi cab, quick, let's back for you

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Ooh, shoot him back, you have what gotta do

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Ooh, just a black, galactic taxi cab from you

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

45
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Come in back, come in back, maybe a half, quick, let's back for you

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Nothing like grabbing a black, galactic taxi cab on a super bright morning

47
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Ooh, just a black, galactic taxi cab from you

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Alex Brummel, from Jersey, of course, thank you, sir, Jersey Todd, for turning me on to him

49
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Link links to Alex Brummel's page at dailysourcecode.com in the show notes

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Coming to you from the curry manner, it is a daily source code episode five

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Was it five or five already, is that, is that we're up to?

52
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Five, five, four, oh man, what are we up to now?

53
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Five, four, three, what are we here in the background?

54
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Everything's completely food bar, okay, do you hear that?

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Here's something really weird going on

56
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Well, that makes it par for the course because

57
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
The more actually last night started off completely food bar

58
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
I told you I was feeling this cold coming on

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Both Patricia and I are pretty sick

60
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,800
And looked at each other this morning and said, well, you know, it's, yeah, it's flyable

61
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,800
But I feel like shit, I'm just not gonna be comfortable doing anything today

62
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,800
And so I, I've postponed everything

63
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Hoping to go tomorrow, of course, whether and body fluids and temperatures premiering

64
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,800
And so, you know, I might have gone into London to visit comic strip blogger

65
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Because he did fly in today, he texted me

66
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
But I'm just not feeling well, I'm really sorry

67
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,800
And in fact, I had my finger on the button to roll out a best of Charlie

68
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Still have a couple of best of Charlie's sitting in the vault

69
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,800
And I was like, okay, I'm just gonna do an intro

70
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
And then I'll just roll out the best of Charlie

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
And then I'll go back to bed or whatever, just chill out, lay down

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
You know, when both mommy and daddy are sick

73
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
And you've got the teenager walking around, you know, there's a lot to do

74
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
So we're taking turns doing shit

75
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
And then I started to hear all the fantastic things that we're sending

76
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Because, you know, I have to clear out my Gmail inbox every single morning

77
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Oh, yeah, I've been doing this for over a year now

78
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,800
You know, I have one of those secret four gigabyte accounts

79
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,800
I've been, you know, deleting attachments for at least 14, 15 months

80
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,800
This will, I would gladly pay to have real unlimited storage

81
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
It's always funny when you enter empty out your Gmail trash

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
And you delete the things forever in there

83
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Ugh, full of your coffee

84
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
There's always a little note that says

85
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Your trash is no empty, but who needs to delete things

86
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
When you have unlimited storage, I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

87
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Who's world you live in in Google?

88
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Alright, it's through bar Friday

89
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
So, properly titled today

90
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I am fucked up beyond all repair

91
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Hey Adam, it's the divas from TheDivaCast.com

92
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Happy Valentine's Day

93
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
The milk cast is what I call that

94
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I like it though, I listen to TheDivaCast

95
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,800
You got to kind of listen through some of the clutter of what it's interesting

96
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
It's like sex in the city, only without the city, without the sex

97
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
But you know, a lot of the issues are there

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
And it's interesting to get to know a little bit more about

99
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,800
The female side of the species

100
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Lots of people calling in to the voicemail line

101
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Using it for different reasons

102
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Apparently also to contact me directly

103
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Oh yeah

104
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,800
In the new edition of that same gossip rag in the Netherlands

105
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,800
They now have pictures of the curry manner

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Apparently they stood outside with a telephoto lens

107
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
In the woods across the way

108
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
It took pictures of us

109
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,800
I can't remember the stories like, you know, while they may be

110
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,800
They may be wanted and on the run or on the lamb

111
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
He's on the lamb

112
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
But look at this nice, nice crib they got

113
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
That was basically the story

114
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
That the first thing Patricia and I said, are the pictures any good?

115
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Yeah, pictures are great

116
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I haven't seen it, but if you're in Holland

117
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
But don't buy it, just go buy the magazine rack

118
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Take a look at the pictures and then just leave it there

119
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
And crumple the edges a little bit, will you?

120
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,800
So anyway, so I'm getting personal phone calls now on the voicemail line

121
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Which actually it's time to, I think it's time to play the US voicemail number again

122
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
We're here for the 37

123
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Man, that thing's irritating, if you're not feeling well

124
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Okay, this is a message in Dutch from a production company

125
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
And I'm going to play it for even though it's in Dutch

126
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Because you're going to recognize those of you in the UK

127
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Well, definitely recognize a few words

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,800
It's one of these typical

129
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,800
We call them producer, I'll just call it production pussy

130
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
That doesn't sound right, does it

131
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,800
You know, one of these associate producers

132
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,800
who's job it is is to go find people to be on shows and so they call celebrities and they're always

133
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,800
perky and they have the minute you pick up the phone and they start talking you know exactly

134
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,800
what kind of beast is on the other line. So listen as a she invites me to a show

135
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,800
and see if you UK folks if you can pick up the title of the show.

136
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Yeah okay then she gives that her phone number okay so you heard the voice right? The name of the program she's invited

137
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,500
me to participate in is a program called Dragon's Den. I have very successful format in the UK

138
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:30,320
so the시는c

139
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,120
is a program called Dragons Den.

140
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,960
A very successful format in the UK.

141
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,000
I think the new season premiered just the other night.

142
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,080
I have it on the on the skybox and we watched it.

143
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:47,480
And essentially, it's five wealthy entrepreneurs

144
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,160
success people who are investors.

145
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,920
And they sit on a panel and people come in and pitch ideas.

146
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,840
I mean, it's kind of an old, it's not a new format.

147
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,320
There are lots of derivatives of the format.

148
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,840
But it's these people are interesting to start off with.

149
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,120
And they do a lot of good screening on the ideas.

150
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,160
And so essentially, they're asking me to do the Dutch version

151
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,560
of the show and be one of the investors.

152
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,160
Which I find a very, very interesting question

153
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,960
because of all people, why come to me, I have not

154
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,640
been successful with my adventures in the Netherlands.

155
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,680
And I, of course, blame it on all the rules the Netherlands has.

156
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,800
You can't be successful.

157
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,640
The country is not set up to be successful.

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,320
It's set up to be a fantastic tax haven if you make money

159
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,880
on royalties of creative works.

160
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,360
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

161
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,800
But if you want to be an entrepreneur, no.

162
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,400
So be interesting to see how the program goes.

163
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,880
So I said, no, I'm beside, I got no time to do that shit

164
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,120
between here and the condo.

165
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,040
But it was flattered flattering.

166
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,640
Flattered, Michael Flattery wasn't flattering to hear it.

167
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,160
Oh, please, someone save me.

168
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,000
Save me.

169
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,560
So Jersey Todd, hey, 10 to rub.

170
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,760
But I got to be honest, last week after my parents

171
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,880
on food were Friday, I really wasn't feeling

172
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,480
a love like I usually do.

173
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,280
So I'm thinking and thinking, what exactly do I need

174
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,080
to make my appearances more special on the Fubar Friday

175
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
edition?

176
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,280
And then it came to me.

177
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,760
Actually, it came to me in an email from Jeremy Row.

178
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Check this out.

179
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,360
I need the new theme song.

180
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:35,360
I'd like to make a motion to work this further around,

181
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:46,360
and then the orange on top to turn its roll around.

182
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:59,360
It's a football Friday, with Jesse Todd on the Charlie.

183
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Ah, that's exactly what I needed, a new theme song from Jeremy Row.

184
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Awesome, dude.

185
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,560
Listen, it's been a very, very busy week here as your official

186
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
musical.

187
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,360
Yeah, it's not about all the glory dude.

188
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,360
It's about doing the hard work that comes with the office.

189
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,960
And I've been taking all these emails, taking all these phone calls, all about your musical

190
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,560
selection for this week.

191
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,920
And I think that really nobody's summed it up better than Paul Durham from Black

192
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Lab.

193
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
Check this out.

194
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,000
Hey Adam, it's Paul Durham from Black Lab.

195
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,920
So if Todd is the official musicologist, then I'm claiming the title of

196
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,400
official rock and rollologist of the Daily Source Code.

197
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,520
I got to say I took your playing the Beatles as a cry for help, a kind of desperate plea

198
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
for new music.

199
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
And I'm here to help.

200
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,160
We have a brand new record called Passion Leaves of Trace, 12 new songs to keep

201
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,720
curry manner rocking for another year.

202
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,080
Valentine's Day is right around the corner, but there's no place for ballots on

203
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
football, Friday.

204
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,040
Here's an evil little tune off our new album called Broken Heart.

205
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,080
Check out the new album on iTunes and Blacklabworld.com.

206
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,160
And of course, you're a pod safe music network.

207
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Thank you Adam.

208
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,160
She looks clear with a broken heart.

209
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,160
She looks an easy mark.

210
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
I hate to be rough.

211
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
I like her so much.

212
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
I don't know where to start.

213
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,160
She looks clear with her eyes red.

214
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,160
But I just don't know where to dress.

215
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
I don't think where she walks.

216
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,160
And the way the shit talks, no matter what she says.

217
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Then you know I know my shit is no one's feeling you.

218
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Then you know I know my shit is no one else ever will do.

219
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Then she knows I need it.

220
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,160
But I've had enough of it all she's got.

221
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
With a broken heart.

222
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,160
I don't know where to start.

223
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,160
But I just don't know where to start.

224
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
But I just don't know where to start.

225
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
But I just don't know where to start.

226
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
But I just don't know where to start.

227
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,160
But I just don't know where to start.

228
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
But I just don't know where to start.

229
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,160
But I just don't know where to start.

230
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
But I just don't know where to start.

231
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,160
But I just don't know where to start.

232
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
But I just don't know where to start.

233
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
But I just don't know where to start.

234
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
But I just don't know where to start.

235
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
But I just don't know where to start.

236
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
But I just don't know where to start.

237
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
But I just don't know where to start.

238
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
But I just don't know where to start.

239
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,160
But I just don't know where to start.

240
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,160
But I just don't know where to start.

241
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,160
But I just don't know where to start.

242
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,160
But I just don't know where to start.

243
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
And I just just don't know where to start.

244
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,160
And I just don't know where to start.

245
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,160
But I just don't know where to start.

246
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,160
But I just don't know where to start.

247
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,160
But I just don't know where to start.

248
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
But I just don't know where to start.

249
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Broken heart!

250
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
She's the best.

251
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,160
She's my sister, my only sister.

252
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
She shows me a good son.

253
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,160
I show her my worst son.

254
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,160
And you know I know my share is no one's feeling you.

255
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,160
And you know I know my share is no one else I will tell you.

256
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,160
Yes, you know I need it.

257
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,160
I've had enough for now.

258
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,160
Yes, you know I need it.

259
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,160
But I see nothing else in the sky of a broken heart.

260
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Black Lab.

261
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Just thinking about how interesting all that.

262
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
That's a real social network for you right there.

263
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,160
I've got Jersey Todd who I've never met in my life,

264
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
only on email and through the...

265
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,160
His contribution as the official musicologist of the Charlie of the Friday,

266
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Fubar Friday.

267
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,160
I met Paul, but only briefly when he was at the office.

268
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,160
They did that Black Lab, did that acoustic set for us on a Fubar Friday.

269
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,160
So he sent a comment to Todd.

270
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,160
And then Todd puts it together, send us to me.

271
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
And then I'm playing it.

272
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,160
And there's a lot of use out there listening to the Charlie.

273
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,160
It's interesting when there's really just two types of movements in music.

274
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Isn't there?

275
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,160
If you look at the whole iTunes,

276
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
big four record company DRM debate.

277
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
And then what we're doing?

278
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,160
You know, and look, you can't just be a musician and have a record company go out and sit

279
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,160
and sit around and have the record company do everything for you.

280
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Because it just doesn't work that way anymore.

281
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
You've got to move it.

282
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
You've got to make it happen, baby.

283
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
You've got to press the flash.

284
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Think of pressing the flash.

285
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Still plenty of time.

286
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
I'm going to keep the submissions open.

287
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Plenty of time for you to send in your preference.

288
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Whether you're a folder or a scruncher.

289
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
I'm testing out some new software.

290
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
It's pretty cool.

291
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,160
I posted a pie chart of the Daily Source Code audience.

292
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Bathroom preference makeup.

293
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Folder or scruncher at dailysourcecode.com as well as in curry.com.

294
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,160
It does work.

295
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
I don't know what we mean.

296
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,160
The software is great, but it would only really be cool for pod show.

297
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
I think if it were server based.

298
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
You could just set up a number.

299
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,160
So anyway, if you want to, if you want to participate.

300
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,160
The number just put it near mobile phone right now.

301
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,160
You're mobile plus four four seven eight one four three three eight five nine zero.

302
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,160
It will cost you whatever an international SMS text message cost.

303
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,160
And if you want to check that number again, of course, you can find it in the show notes at

304
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,160
dailysourcecode.com.

305
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Oh, you're something else I wanted to say about.

306
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,160
So it's just, you know, just isn't with music, a whole new different approach has to be taken with the marketing and the packaging.

307
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
It's the same with new shows.

308
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,160
You know, we've got a couple of new shows, new episodes coming out with all new shows.

309
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
You can't just put it on the channel.

310
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:55,160
And because you have 24 as a lead in or American idol or whatever that you're guaranteed to get audience.

311
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,160
You know, it's like a tree in a forest.

312
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,160
So I got to help promote some stuff.

313
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Marie Claire dot pod show dot com.

314
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
This is awesome.

315
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,160
I wasn't a big fan of episode three.

316
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
Now, this is it's called the mast head.

317
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:17,160
And it's a reality based episodic show around the making of the magazine.

318
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,160
Marie Claire, which is, you know, guys, you're not going to give a shit.

319
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,160
Okay, don't even go look.

320
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
But girls, let me tell you.

321
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
I've made a study of this.

322
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
I live with fashion divas.

323
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
They've been all around me.

324
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,160
And this type of show, I consider to be female pornography.

325
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
It's just porn.

326
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
The money shots?

327
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,160
I know exactly what they have to be.

328
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
You know it, too.

329
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
You know what you'd like.

330
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Look at that when it comes to fashion and style.

331
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
And that make believe world.

332
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,160
And the world of devil wears product.

333
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Well, we've got an, I don't know if it's up yet.

334
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:55,160
I think it is episode number four, which was shot, of course, at Marie Claire,

335
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,160
but also around the photo shoot they did at the United Nations.

336
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
First time a fashion photo shoot is over there.

337
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
You've got to see this show.

338
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
It's like eight or ten minutes long.

339
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,160
And I think you will enjoy it because again, it really is just pure porn.

340
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
porn for women.

341
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Adam Curry proud to be a pornographer.

342
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Our posh people big smile.

343
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
God, they got shit.

344
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
It's a fine question.

345
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
Yes, it is.

346
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
Our posh people pigs.

347
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Alright, whether I'm football or not, we got to wind up the week with, uh,

348
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,160
with at least one more look at, uh, our quest for the answer.

349
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Our posh people potty pigs.

350
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Well, there's some questions about some of the findings that our survey has, uh, delivered.

351
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
Our hire.

352
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
David's first calling.

353
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
How you doing?

354
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Good.

355
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
And just listening to, I think it's five, three, nine.

356
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,160
We have a gentleman's talking about the movement in Germany,

357
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,160
set to the team club.

358
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Um, I want to know.

359
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
How about hell?

360
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
To sitting.

361
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,160
And they get different to whether the pipes are right and right.

362
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,160
Yeah, that's a very good question.

363
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,160
It's, and by the way, I've been corrected by, uh, my many German listeners.

364
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
It's, it's in,

365
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,160
Pinklyn with a pee for pinkle.

366
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
It's in,

367
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Pinklyn.

368
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Pinklyn while sitting down.

369
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Uh, I think the point of that, uh, of, you know, that whole story about the apartment building

370
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,160
that torn down and, uh, apartments that had been used by men.

371
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,160
They had to basically remove all this corroded piping.

372
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
I think it's because it goes down the outside.

373
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,160
The outside of the pipe and, you know, or the outside of the bowl,

374
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
it drips down.

375
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
It's just, it's a mess.

376
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
It really is.

377
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,160
And it's, you know, you don't have to be a, a bad aim.

378
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
You know, if you're tall like me,

379
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,160
you're just basically creating velocity that got to go somewhere.

380
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,160
And it is quite disgusting for other people living in the house with you.

381
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:51,160
So, I've, uh, I still find, you know, I catch myself once in a while thinking,

382
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
you know, they'll just be, I'll just be really quick.

383
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
I'll be really fast.

384
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
I won't sit down, but really, it makes no difference

385
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
whether you sit down or whether you stand,

386
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
particularly with the buttonfly jeans.

387
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
It's kind of like a lot of bullshit to me. I'm sorry.

388
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
No, I'm sorry.

389
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,160
And further to the, uh, post people, post Pete.

390
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Um, I don't know about many post places, but, uh,

391
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,160
with my girlfriend and her kids, we visit terms,

392
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
places for McDonalds and, uh,

393
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Hungry Jacks. Sorry to be very keen.

394
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Oh, wait a minute.

395
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Burger King is hungry jacks down on it.

396
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
That's interesting.

397
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Why not just Burger King?

398
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
It's like a, like a Paul fiction thing.

399
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
The Royale with cheese.

400
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,160
You know what, I've already listened to this,

401
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,160
and he's just going to go into this whole thing about more,

402
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,160
like, tampon stories.

403
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,160
And can I just say something as a species, as a human race?

404
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,160
So far from coast to coast around this blue marble,

405
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
the glow we call Mother Earth.

406
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
We are all potty pigs.

407
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
We're fucking disgusting.

408
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:09,160
And it is, and Demic to our youth because we know,

409
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,160
we know that someone is going to clean that shit up,

410
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,160
so finally we don't have to.

411
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,160
I'd like to make a solemn vow here that I'm going to, uh,

412
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,160
not be a potty pig and certainly not a posh one.

413
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,160
And I'd like all of you Charlie listeners to join in this movement.

414
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,160
And by the way, if you see something nasty, pick it up.

415
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
It's okay, clean it up, pick it up.

416
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,160
You can always wash your hands.

417
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,160
And maybe just maybe.

418
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,160
We'll start something that will be better for all of mine can.

419
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:59,160
Lounge, down tempo, chill out time.

420
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:04,160
Electronic and acoustic music from all over the world.

421
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,160

429
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
And for those of you still hanging around,

430
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
because you downloaded like a normal human being.

431
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,160
And you're in the UK, give us a call, mate.

432
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:55,160
And it's our friend Charles the Drunken Londoner.

433
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
No long, you know, he needs a jingle.

434
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Yeah, no longer drunk, I fear.

435
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Hello, Adam.

436
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,160
It's Charles your Hangout the Londoner.

437
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,160
First of all, I want to apologize for, uh,

438
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,160
that Drunken message.

439
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Um, I really need some apologizing is that, um,

440
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
I rambled on and on and on.

441
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
And that was just all thing to do.

442
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,160
To be honest, I don't actually recall leaving that message.

443
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,160
And it was a bit of a shock listening to.

444
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,160
I think it's five, first and nine I was listening to.

445
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
That you see.

446
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Doing good work here, doing good social services.

447
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,160
It's, it's interesting when you hear yourself drunk isn't a Charles.

448
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Ah, my friend.

449
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,160
If you can't even remember calling in maybe it's time to lighten up

450
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
just a little bit on the paints.

451
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,160
And, uh, you played that comment.

452
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Uh, I also want to apologize for Malcolm and, uh,

453
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
Abu Dhabi.

454
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,160
My friend, you rock, you have me best voice.

455
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,160
And, um, I love the fact that you think about what you're going to say before you

456
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
record your comment.

457
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Um, and phone them in.

458
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,160
And that must be really appreciated by Adam and it certainly appreciated

459
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,160
to, uh, by us, the listeners.

460
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,160
Now, I wanted to now go on to, uh, the, um, posh people for what he's

461
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
do does.

462
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,160
Um, I once worked for a large media company.

463
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,160
They had a problem that was excluded to the latest toilets.

464
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,160
And, uh, all the women were taken into a meeting.

465
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:20,160
And, um, we're given a, a talking to, and it continues for a little while

466
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,160
and then, and then it stopped shortly after someone left the company,

467
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,160
which I, I think was probably just a set up to be honest.

468
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
You know, it's a quite a good room.

469
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
And it's something you don't look like, leave the company.

470
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
Then you stop doing the thing that you've been doing.

471
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
Anyway, that's just my mind.

472
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,160
What's like your idea was, uh, and me rambling on again.

473
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Um, oh, the other thing, they knew that it was a woman that was doing this because, uh,

474
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
uh, another man speaking, you know what?

475
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
I'm not going to go there.

476
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Anyway, because I was, what a lovely snow day we've had today.

477
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Yeah, I was there.

478
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
This is a junior.

479
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
You know, yeah, bye.

480
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
All right, Charles.

481
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
Amen.

482
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,160
You sound like a human almost when you're not drunk.

483
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Just something to consider.

484
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,160
I'm just saying, you know what I mean?

485
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
Uh, okay.

486
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
Should we close that topic?

487
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
I'm kind of done with it.

488
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,160
I do want us all to, to practice sanitary bathroom habits.

489
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
So that will be nice.

490
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,160
Grammys coming up this weekend that, of course, pod shows paying attention to it.

491
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
It's not life.

492
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
It's not backstage.

493
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
And it's so not LA.

494
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,160
It's Carolina and Michael.

495
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Dishon, the Grammys.

496
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Get the real dish on who's wearing who, who is doing who,

497
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,160
and who's going to be wearing the winning and losing shoes.

498
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Who's doing the dishes at this year's Grammy Awards?

499
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,160
It's Carolina and Michael.

500
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Dishon, the Grammys.

501
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,160
And it's only a dish of the Grammys dot hot show with hot cow.

502
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
That's Michael Butler.

503
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
I'm very own rock and roll geek.

504
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,160
And we have Carolina who is the receptionist at Pod Show.

505
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,160
And I got to tell you, I've heard, I've heard these episodes.

506
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,160
You're going to love it.

507
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,160
Why not down the week?

508
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
That means one more update on our old girl.

509
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Sing along if you're sick, okay?

510
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,160
More email coming in from the mistress of the project.

511
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Folders.

512
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,160
With nice, splendid flavor blends.

513
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Eh, what a comment.

514
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Hey, how come no one's called me and it's tried those two together, huh?

515
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Please.

516
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:58,160
Barbara the Palo Alto podcaster who is now managing the group at free Trinity,

517
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160

00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,160
You can find the link to that in the show notes at DennySourceco.com.

519
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,160
It's starting to collect some interesting statistics and very interesting

520
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,160
invitations for Trinity to stop by.

521
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,160
And I'll try to see Tim from Eugene Oregon, not a podcast or a

522
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
biodieselike expert.

523
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,160
However, I could likely range any or all of the following.

524
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,160
I meet up with some people from the Eugene BioCare share.

525
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Interesting.

526
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Or meeting interview or whatever people from sequential biofuels.

527
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,160
They opened up the Pacific Northwest First Commercial Biofuel Station.

528
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
Nice.

529
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160

We have Charlie in Texas who's running biodiesel in his kaboda

531
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160

532
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
The horse is love it.

533
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,160
Is that a Japanese tractor?

534
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
They're pretty good.

535
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,160
A Christian daily, of course, from Houston.

536
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160

This video, of course, is a professional video montage artist.

538
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Doug Moore from Georgia, helped Trinity across North Georgia.

539
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Could drive anywhere from North Georgia mountains and metroid land on

540
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Athens.

541
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Just a realtor.

542
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
Good old Doug.

543
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Mike from Portland, my wife and I do a podcast.

544
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,160

00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,160
There's a biodiesel station down the street for my office, which needs to fill up.

547
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Interesting.

548
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Just Smith, of course, from Nashville, Tennessee is a biofuel place in

549
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Murphy'sboro, town just outside Nashville.

550
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Kevin Reeves pops in.

551
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Hey, you don't want my blind ass drive and Trinity around town, but

552
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
damn it.

553
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
I'd love to take a ride.

554
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Let Jeff Smith are evil at the wheel.

555
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Fuck no, man.

556
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
I think we put Kevin Reeves behind the wheel.

557
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,160
I'll be funny.

558
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,160
You're definitely on the map.

559
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
I'll be awesome.

560
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,160
Michael Pilly and Baker's Field California.

561
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Jack of all trades when it comes to technology.

562
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I'm available as a podcaster.

563
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,160
I produce a weekly NASCAR podcast, local DJ here in town.

564
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Videographer mapping, making local contacts to events.

565

Video of refueling station in San Diego.

566
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Tell you, it's all over the place.

567
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:08,160
Jack Elias is a friend of the Charlie from Washington.

568
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,160
There's a march on the Pentagon to end the war.

569
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,160
March 17th since Patrick's day, drink green beer and end the war.

570
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
It'd be great if Trinity could be there then.

571
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
March 17th.

572
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
I don't know if we can make it.

573
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
We don't even have a start date yet, but.

574
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
And the list just goes on and on and on.

575
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
It's fascinating.

576
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,160
So if you want to join up and if you want to give Trinity a

577
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
world.

578
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,160
As you can see, I mean, you don't have to be able to have vision.

579
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,160
You can participate in the project.

580
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Let me see, was anything else I had to do.

581
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Okay, so.

582
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,160
All right, so Barbara's going to do a push pin version of this, I guess.

583
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Excellent.

584
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160

00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
The greater central luxury.

589
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Trinity.

590
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
Trinity.

591
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160

Win valuable prizes.

599
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Trinity.

600
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,160
Twice a long, long time ago, my friends.

601
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,160
When little podcasters used to climb, well, you don't come climb up on my knee right now.

602
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,160
And would ask me questions about how to do their show.

603
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Yeah, how to manage data and climb some campuses going.

604
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
I'm going to inspiring podcasters.

605
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,160
And of course, I use the podshow plus page.

606
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
And I get all these great stats and numbers.

607
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
My question is simple.

608
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,160
How do I know if my podcasters success?

609
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,160
I mean, I talked to other podcasters, and they're all tightly-picked.

610
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,160
Like the number of uploads and downloads is some secret formula or top secret information.

611
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
So I wanted to want to tell them my stats.

612
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
I like that my stats.

613
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Do they sit around and laugh?

614
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,160
That means if you haven't had so many downloads or are they going to laugh?

615
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
That's really good.

616
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,160
That's considered success.

617
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,160
Hope you can give me some insight on that.

618
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
That's it.

619
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
Thanks very much.

620
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Folder with a slight twist.

621
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Alright.

622
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Well, okay.

623
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,160
So I appreciate you asking the question.

624
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,160
I would say for a show.

625
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,160
The number you're looking for is at least two.

626
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,160
Because you probably download your own show just to check it out and maybe listen to it again.

627
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,160
And if at least one other person is listening, that's success.

628
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,160
I got to tell you, I do not look at my stats.

629
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Once a month at the roll over period more or less, I want to see if I went up.

630
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,160
And I have to say that's pretty much been a 30% increase month over month.

631
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Since, well, I mean, the early days, the increases were much larger.

632
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Certainly for the past six months.

633
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,160
It's been a 30% month over month increase.

634
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
It's all look at that.

635
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,160
But I don't even look at the absolute number.

636
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,160
It's big though.

637
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:59,160
And it doesn't matter because I still feel like I'm talking to the same 20 people for some reason.

638
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
It's really funny that way.

639
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,160
And maybe it's only the people who contribute to the show.

640
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,160
And that doesn't, you know, that's fine because I know that there's a lot more people listening that are contributing to the show.

641
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,160
But I know that they're enjoying it in their own way.

642
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
And they don't have to contribute.

643
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
That's not a problem.

644
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,160
And maybe one day they will, which is another part of the magic of it all.

645
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:26,160
But really, it feels like, you know, just the people who call in, then I'm just talking to you guys.

646
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
And that's just the way that's the way I do my show.

647
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,160
You know, if you do a PW event like production.

648
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:39,160
You know, it's, it's much more of storytelling and less of an ongoing dialogue with the audience.

649
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,160
You know, that may be different.

650
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,160
I don't know.

651
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
It's hard to say.

652
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
I find it very hard to say.

653
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:53,160
But yeah, for me, the fulfillment does not come from how high the number is.

654
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,160
It just comes from the loop, the immediate feedback loop.

655
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,160
So again, if at least one other person is listening.

656
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
And if that person is actually or watching.

657
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,160
And if that person is is feeding back to you even with comments.

658
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:12,160
That's the justice valid is sending in an audio comment or dialing the voice mail line or sending in an SMS text message,

659
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
whether you're a folder or scruncher.

660
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,160
Yeah, it's, it's all, it's all good.

661
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,160
That's my feeling.

662
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,160
Now, of course, when it comes to commercializing podcasting,

663
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Well, then you have to have a certain audience.

664
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,160
But even though, even though, you know, we're finding that.

665
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:38,160
There are sponsors who are understanding advertisers who are understanding the value of this exact link that I'm talking about.

666
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:45,160
And that, you know, you shouldn't be buying based upon an absolute number of people hearing a commercial.

667
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
In the hopes that something will stick.

668
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,160
And as a part of an overall strategy and overall media buying plan that, you know,

669
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,160
you'll, the message will hate you at least a couple of times until you remember it.

670
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,160
I saw this last night with the, with the mastide with Marie Claire, because I show Patricia this stuff, you know,

671
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,160
and I say, huh, I got some more porn.

672
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,160
And let's take a look at it.

673
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,160
And there's some clever advertising in that.

674
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,160
And product placement, I got to tell you right up front.

675
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:23,160
And it was so funny because at one point, one of the stylists for this photo shoot is a,

676
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,160
a steaming down address and saying, you know, we have to bring this stuff back.

677
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,160
So we want to make sure that it's absolutely flawless that the girls don't mess it up.

678
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,160
We make sure they wear deodorant so they're not sweating in it, especially not deodorant that has white marks that, you know,

679
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
this sounds like a logical story.

680
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,160
And she shows a, a, a, a swath deodorant swath is one of the, one of the sponsors of the show.

681
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
And it's just, and she actually, she just picks it up.

682
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
It's there.

683
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
I mean, I don't know if it was placed there or not, doesn't matter.

684
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,160
And I saw Patricia lean into the screen.

685
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
And I said, what are you doing?

686
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,160
And she said, well, I'm trying to, I'm trying to see which one she was recommending.

687
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,160
I thought that was really interesting.

688
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,160
And then right after right after that segment, there's a short, a swath commercial.

689
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
And she said, oh, okay, now I know what it is.

690
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,160
And I was like, wow, she wasn't offended by it.

691
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,160
She was actually interested in it.

692
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,160
It gave her porn and information at the same time.

693
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,160
But with the hell that I get off talking about this about who cares?

694
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
Anyway, uh, fuck it, have fun.

695
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,160
That's what it's all about.

696
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Hey, hi, you doing everybody?

697
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,160
