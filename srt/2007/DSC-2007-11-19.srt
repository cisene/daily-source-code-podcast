00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Yo, what's up? It's your man Tony Costa from Costa's world.

00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,120

But you cannot exchange family.

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,600
So make sure you check out this Christmas when it hits theaters,

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,800
November 21st, 2007, and a mouth.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In a world where women wear comfortable shoes

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and technology has changed the way you get your entertainment.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is the pod shown at work.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No big media.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No excuses. No BS.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now, the share of Charlie six eight and nine are...

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000

$16 billion worth of airframes.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
$16 billion worth of airframes.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
$16 billion worth of airframes.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
$16 billion worth of airframes.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
$16 chart out of several hours a week.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Just as tangible as you think.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh yeah, it's January $13,000.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm in now the Georgia, he was looking for a so-or-steel.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He was in a bag because he fed the hat

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,540
The bag, because he was way behind, he was with him to make a deal.

30
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,380
When he came across his young man's son, on the field in plain and high,

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,340
and the devil jumped up on the haylist of support him until you walk.

32
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,280
I guess you didn't know when I'm a little player too.

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,020
And if you cared to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.

34
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,780
Now you play pretty good, filial mugs, you give the devil a deal.

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,740
I've been a little in gold against your souls, to make out better to.

36
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,400
I've been a little in my name's Johnny, and it might be a sin.

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,400
But I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret, and I'll make a bet with everything.

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,200
Got to hear us, I'm a good boy, and play a fiddle hard.

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,240
Dolls hell is both loose and Jordan, the devil deals a card.

40
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,120
And if you knew, get this shot, it'll let it go.

41
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,120
But if you lose, it'll get your soul.

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,680
The music is a piece of beast that I'll start this show.

43
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,580
With fire, with respect, your tips, and your rugs, the devil.

44
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,580
And if you pull the whole across the street, but it made a evil hiss.

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,780
And the band of demons, you're a head of this madness, unlike this.

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:03:15,680
And the band of demons, you're a head of this madness, unlike this madness, unlike this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness

47
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:45,680
madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this madness, like this這一 world, like this madness, like this

48
00:03:45,680 --> 00:04:09,680
The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.

49
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,680
He laid that golden fiddle on the ground to join his feet.

50
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,680
The devil just come home back and be everyone to try again.

51
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,680
I don't know what you want, you son of a bitch, I'm the best and they were me and we played.

52
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
Yeah, we've like mashed potatoes.

53
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,680
The devil went down on Vinnie.

54
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
mashed up by auto-violet.

55
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Charlie Daniel's been in Ram Jam.

56
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,680
What better way to start a new week on the Charlie?

57
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,680
With something mashed up so thick, it's like, you're right.

58
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Ah, definitely a little, uh, little model there in the middle, but uh,

59
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,680
felt good and nonetheless, everybody how you doing?

60
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Episode number 689 of the Daily Source code coming to you

61
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
from the curry manner.

62
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,680
I'm up here in the attic, skies, overcast, cloudy, rainy.

63
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,680
We had a shitty weekend, capital S.

64
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Even though I had the whole weekend more or less often to ourselves,

65
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,680
the weather was just not fl- I mean, it was flyable.

66
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
If you want to fly to thousand feet in the rain,

67
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,680
which was not what the Lady Pea was looking forward to.

68
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,680
So we left the Delta's share of parks and just chilled out.

69
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,680
I had a- really a nice relaxing kind of a- one of those really dark

70
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
wintery weekends.

71
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,680
If you know what I mean, you know, where you just put on some smooth

72
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,680
music during the day, we've got a coal fireplace,

73
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
let that sucker up, had it blazing.

74
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Actually, we got two of them had both of them blazing away.

75
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Great television on this weekend.

76
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Actually, I should go back to Friday night.

77
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Oh, man.

78
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
So, you know, last week was totally nuts.

79
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,680
And I predicted this, this is going to be crazy before the, you know,

80
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,680
the end of the, between now and the end of the year, it's going to be nuts for me.

81
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,680
And this is mainly because we have a number of rather large deals that are on the table

82
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,680
that we're trying to get close before the holidays quite honestly.

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Because otherwise, you know, it's, it's January and then it's mid-January

84
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,680
and then we all ramp up again and it's February and it's just that takes too long.

85
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
So that's our experience.

86
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
So we're pushing real hard.

87
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
And a couple of these deals.

88
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,680
And so Friday went out with the Super Agent Keith with the badge,

89
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,680
our deal maker extraordinaire, this guy.

90
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,680
I got to get him on the show because he was on his talk and see it.

91
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Let me tell you.

92
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,680
So it was with Madeleine who's head cheese now at the, whatever that means at the,

93
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
at the Pod Show along the office.

94
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,680
And bad used to work in the 70s.

95
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,680
He worked for the deep purple organization.

96
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,680
And, you know, he's a deal maker lawyer finance guy,

97
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
but he's like 62, I think.

98
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Maybe a little older than that.

99
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
He just had five weeks ago.

100
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
He had opened a hard surgery.

101
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
And he's a revelman.

102
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
He's a revolutionary.

103
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,680
And he was talking about how, you know,

104
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,680
they were always trying to find the right tax breaks for, for deeper pull.

105
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,680
And if they recorded the songs outside of the country,

106
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
they didn't have to pay taxes in the UK.

107
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,680
And then the, you know, the internal revenue service,

108
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
I came to them and said,

109
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,680
we have, but they're writing these songs here in the UK.

110
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,680
And they're about to get a multi-million dollar tax bill.

111
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,680
When they were able to say, no, that's not true.

112
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Case in point.

113
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Here's, I forget what the name of the album was.

114
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Here's the song, Smoke on the Water, which you may or may not know,

115
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,680
was written after the casino in Montro, caught fire and up in the attic of this building.

116
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,680
The top floor is where Deep Purple had their studio.

117
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
And he said, look, there's the proof.

118
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,680
We wrote Smoke on the water when the frickin' casino was burning down.

119
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
They wrote them outside of the UK.

120
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,680
And they, and their argument was accepted and saved a million,

121
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
millions of pounds and taxes.

122
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,680
And he's full of shit like that.

123
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,680
So that was a good time head by all, as we drank away the night.

124
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Oh, yeah.

125
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
I was home like a two o'clock.

126
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
That's, that's a late for me.

127
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Anyway, as I said, nice easy afternoon.

128
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Nice Saturday.

129
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Of course, dancing with the stars,

130
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,680
or strictly come dancing was on, which Patricia and I followed.

131
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
There's also, I'm a celebrity get me out of here.

132
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Also started up again.

133
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
And you know, I'm a sucker for these shows.

134
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Scripted drama is what I'd call them.

135
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Not reality.

136
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Scripted drama.

137
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,680
And actually, there was an interesting article that I saw in the,

138
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Let me see, was a BBC article.

139
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,680
There, yeah, the same team behind strictly come dancing.

140
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,680
The original dancing with the stars here in the UK.

141
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Sitting up a new talent competition with choirs.

142
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,680
And you know, I've said this many times before.

143
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,680
If you really, really want to get a huge audience,

144
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,680
do something with either choirs in the, in Europe would be choirs in the US.

145
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,680
It would be with the cadences with drum lines and high school bands.

146
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,680
Because there's so many people who either participate,

147
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,680
our member of a club have participated or a married to someone who's in a choir.

148
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,680
I mean, it's just tons and tons of them.

149
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
I think it's going to be a huge hit.

150
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
You mark my words.

151
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,680
It'll be another unscripted drama.

152
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,680
But the best, the best television I saw all weekend,

153
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,680
without a doubt.

154
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Without a doubt is banging with Butler.

155
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,680
This airs live throughout the week.

156
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Well, of course, it's not live at air several times.

157
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,680
Throughout the weekend on the plus, if you go to the plus TV.com

158
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,680
at midnight Pacific, I think we actually do it at midnight all time zone.

159
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
So it's pretty much all Butler all the time.

160
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,680
He's doing his version of the head bangers ball.

161
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
And it really, it kicks ass.

162
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,680
It is so awesome.

163
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,680
And I think you can get the, each episode downloaded as well.

164
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Banging with Butler.potcho.com.

165
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,680
I think that's the, I think that's the URL.

166
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
I'll put a link in the show notes.

167
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,680
You've got to see what Mike is doing.

168
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
It is absolutely fantastic.

169
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,680
I think he has, he is really honoring the,

170
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,680
the time on our tradition of the Saturday night head bangers ball.

171
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
It's great stuff.

172
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Great videos.

173
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,680
And of course, he's allowed the drink of beer on the set,

174
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
which is even awesome.

175
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Hey, Ed, and this is Mark.

176
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
I know you're tired.

177
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,680
But we need to hear everything about the Nokia N800 10.

178
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,680
That's such a great thing.

179
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
You know, my, my iPods have died on me.

180
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
And I need to get something new.

181
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,680
I hope you guys will open something out with Nokia.

182
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,680
So I got my channels on the Nokia.

183
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
Yeah.

184
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Tell us.

185
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Thank you.

186
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Yeah.

187
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Thank you.

188
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,680
Well, I'm glad you asked because I'm pretty excited about this as well.

189
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,680
I think it's shipping this week in the Nokia N810.

190
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Excuse me, which is their new internet tablet.

191
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,680
And, you know, I, of course, when I picked up my Mac,

192
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,680
by the way, I love it so much.

193
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
A God.

194
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
I'm one of the fortunate ones, I think.

195
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
No upgrade problems.

196
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
It's just rolling.

197
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
Love it.

198
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
Staying together.

199
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Low noise.

200
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
Low heat.

201
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Fast response.

202
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Lots of things I love from the Unix world.

203
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,680
I just love it.

204
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,680
I easily could have picked up another iPhone.

205
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,680
Because they're on sale now in Europe as well in the UK.

206
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,680
But I didn't because I've been waiting.

207
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
First of all, I've learned my lesson.

208
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
I need a much more robust device.

209
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
I need something that can be dropped.

210
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,680
Can be thrown across a table.

211
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,680
The really does have all of the.

212
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
You know, accepted protocols work in, you know,

213
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,680
and I don't want to be tied down to.

214
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,680
To my laptop to be able to put stuff on it and take.

215
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
I mean, there's a lot of drawbacks.

216
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Obviously, the way they present the browser is just phenomenally beautiful.

217
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,680
You know, so I think there I'm a believer in the three.

218
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
The three types of devices.

219
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,680
And you carry them at different times rarely all together.

220
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
And sometimes you do have them all with you at the same time.

221
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,680
So you have your laptop, which now without a doubt is my Mac.

222
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
I love it.

223
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
You know, I'm I'm taking it everywhere.

224
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
I go.

225
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,680
I'm taking it into the bathroom with me.

226
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,680
And which is okay because it can't actually physically fit through the hole in the toilet if I drop it.

227
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Now, by the way, these Macs are pretty vulnerable too.

228
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,680
I've dropped a one or two in my day and they do wind up the power book.

229
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
It does wind up pretty much hose.

230
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,680
If you drop it from, you know, if you just drop it wrong.

231
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,680
Then, of course, there's the mobile phone, which needs to have some type of browser capability.

232
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,680
I've been running the opera mini browser on my Nokia E61 eye.

233
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,680
And you know, for just getting Google and by the way, thank you, Google.

234
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
You guys are awesome.

235
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,680
You know, now besides having Gmail from mobile,

236
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,680
there's the Google reader from mobile.

237
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:36,680
Now we have finally the Google notebook from mobile, which is you get to in the usual Google way.

238
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,680
It's Google.com slash notebook slash M fantastic.

239
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Great job.

240
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,680
So, you know, really got everything I need right there.

241
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,680
And of course, the E61 eye synchronizes seamlessly with my Mac,

242
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,680
which it does through I call, which in turn seamlessly synchronizes with my Google calendar account.

243
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,680
I mean, all this stuff is really starting to fit together quite nicely.

244
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680
And I'm not having to think about it anymore.

245
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
It's just kind of working.

246
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,680
Now, in between those two devices, there is room for something else.

247
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,680
And, you know, just as my laptop is not a phone,

248
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,680
and my phone is not a laptop, there's something in the middle.

249
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,680
And I believe it's this concept of the internet tablet.

250
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,680
And, you know, I've had great pleasure with the N800,

251
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,680
particularly since it got Skype, which is our company's main means of IAM.

252
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,680
So, that you can get all kinds of IAM programs on it,

253
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,680
but having Skype is a big plus.

254
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,680
And, of course, you can also make your regular Skype calls through it.

255
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,680
I'd place flash video.

256
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,680
In fact, you might have noticed if you have an N800,

257
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,680
or you can try with any browser, actually.

258
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,680
If you click on a show at poncho.com,

259
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,680
and it's a poncho program, so something you've uploaded.

260
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,680
Let's say it's video, because that's kind of the easiest way to detect it.

261
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,680
No matter what you uploaded in the dashboard, it's now playing in flash,

262
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,680
yet the big media files are still available for download.

263
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,680
So, that now also works on the N800, where you can pop up the dashboard,

264
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,680
and it'll play the show in flash, and it actually works.

265
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
It's really cool.

266
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,680
So, this new version, and I believe that the new OS,

267
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,680
which is a big part of it, you know, there's a new operating system,

268
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,680
like an upgrade, kind of like the new leopard, if you will,

269
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,680
for the N devices, it's slick.

270
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
And it's a lot faster.

271
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,680
The flash videos play much, you know, they play smoothly.

272
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,680
Let's put it that way.

273
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,680
Everything's more responsive.

274
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
The Zoom functions work much faster.

275
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
They've really optimized, because it's the same process

276
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680
where I believe in this new device.

277
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,680
They've really optimized the speed with the OS,

278
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
and with the hardware.

279
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Now, add onto that that they have added a slide out keyboard,

280
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,680
which is just phenomenally easy.

281
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,680
The whole idea of on-screen keyboards, yeah, it works.

282
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,680
But it just makes the device a little bit less usable

283
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for the situations I think it's intended for.

284
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,680
So, I can literally now take this thing, slip in my backpack,

285
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
and I've got the internet with me.

286
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,680
Almost anything I would need.

287
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,680
If not, I'm sure there's a program out there.

288
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,680
I could download or, because it's all open source,

289
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,680
I can, you know, build myself,

290
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,680
or I could join some groups and see if I could motivate

291
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
some developers to build it.

292
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,680
So, it's a, it's a great device.

293
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,680
Don't actually have one in my hands yet.

294
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
I'm expecting it, you know, to get one soon enough,

295
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,680
and again, we're looking at, at getting all listeners

296
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,680
of the daily source code and other podshow programming

297
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,680
who will be in this, an 800 program.

298
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,680
We're looking at getting you promo codes,

299
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,680
so you can order them right online,

300
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,680
and get a nice discount.

301
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,680
I believe it's like 15% discount, discount to the market.

302
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
That's going to be awesome.

303
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Stay tuned for that.

304
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Just before I started an email from Alex Freeze in High Adam,

305
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,680
I would like to apologize.

306
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,680
When we met a couple months back,

307
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,680
you mentioned they proposed North American Union,

308
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,680
and I scoffed.

309
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Well, a friend sent me a report on CNBC,

310
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
and this link as well.

311
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
I don't know what to say,

312
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,680
except that I'm deeply embarrassed for having

313
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,680
so casually discounted something that actually has legs.

314
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Let's listen to this MSNBC report for just a second.

315
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
This is about the Amaro.

316
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
This will be very interesting if you weren't

317
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
a believer before that it's actually happening.

318
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,680
A new currency for the Canada, the United States,

319
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
and Mexico.

320
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,680
And this is an actual news report from CNBC

321
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,680
with Steve Previs VP of Jeffree's International Limited.

322
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Check it out.

323
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,680
We're coming into a cyclical bottom for gold,

324
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,680
and it rises going into December, January,

325
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,680
so that might be the reverse of the dollar fall.

326
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,680
Apart from that,

327
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
I think one thing people who are dollar-based

328
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
need to focus on is the Amaro.

329
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
That's the one thing that nobody's talking about,

330
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
but I think it's going to have a big impact on

331
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,680
everybody's life in Canada,

332
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
the US and Mexico.

333
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,680
If you Google it, you'll find out all about it.

334
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
Well, you could tell us a little bit more right now.

335
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
You always hear about CNBC guys.

336
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,680
The Amaro is the supposedly currency

337
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
for the North American community,

338
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,680
which is being developed right now

339
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
in Canada, the US and Mexico,

340
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,680
to make a borderless community,

341
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
much like the EU,

342
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,680
and the dollar Canadian dollar US dollar

343
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,680
and the Mexican pays for replaced by the Amaro.

344
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,680
You really think that would get any leeway?

345
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
You may want to visit a couple websites

346
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,680
and see how far along it is.

347
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,680
The Canadians are pretty upset about it,

348
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
whereas the Americans apart from the Texans

349
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,680
are the only people who know anything about it.

350
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,680
The rest of the public's really sort of with their

351
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
headness and on this way.

352
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
Well, there you go.

353
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
Yeah, it's for real.

354
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
It's really common.

355
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
And that, of course, explains,

356
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
talked about this on Noah Genda

357
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
with John Devorek over the weekend.

358
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Oh, that's what I did on Saturday.

359
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
That's right, Ron.

360
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,680
After grocery shopping with Lady P.

361
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,680
Did a quick, no agenda with John C. Devorek.

362
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
You can find it at NoahGenda.podshow.com.

363
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
We talked about that

364
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,680
and about how the Liberty dollar folks

365
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,680
who also make the Ron Paul dollar

366
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,680
were rated by federal agents

367
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,680
that took away all the money,

368
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
all the tender they had created,

369
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,680
as well as all the gold and silver to back it.

370
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,680
Well, gee, could that do you think be

371
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,680
because it was actually gaining traction

372
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,680
and they're worried that an alternate currency

373
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,680
outside of the old, let me think a mirror

374
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
might actually gain some traction

375
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,680
and become a defacto standard?

376
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Yeah, I think so.

377
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Of course, Ron Paul really has nothing to do with this.

378
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
And I would like to remind you that

379
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
we're at about eight and a half million dollars

380
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,680
of the twelve needed before the end of the year.

381
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
I think we can still easily make it.

382
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,680
I understand December 16th

383
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
is going to be the next Ron Paul money bomb

384
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
we're going to drop.

385
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,680
So you'll be here and more about this on this program.

386
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,680
I'm still a huge support of this guy

387
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
and door some holy.

388
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,680
It's funny when talking to John Devorek.

389
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,680
It's really interesting because it doesn't matter

390
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,680
what people say to him in any debate.

391
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
All he has to do is just, you know,

392
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,680
recite the constitution, apply the question

393
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
or the issue to the constitution.

394
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
You come up with an answer.

395
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Don't even really need a guy.

396
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,680
You know, of course, we want a leader

397
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,680
and someone who will remind us and stand strong

398
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,680
and take us down the path that the founders intended.

399
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
At least that's what I believe.

400
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,680
You know, but he could easily be a robot.

401
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
That's that simple.

402
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
And it's not a lot of, you could do it.

403
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,680
You too could protect the constitution.

404
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
You too could be present.

405
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
It really could happen.

406
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
So let's support this guy.

407
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,680
I think he's already into double digits now in the polls,

408
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,680
which of course may be skewed in the polls

409
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
in the primary markets.

410
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
So keep an eye on this guy.

411
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
I'm certainly pushing for, I would love it.

412
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,680
If this guy became present, how fucking cool would that be?

413
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,680
I'm pretty sure I could at least get one night

414
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
in the Lincoln bedroom.

415
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,680
And of course, we might actually be free

416
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
and rid of all crap.

417
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,680
That would be pretty good deal, I say.

418
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Yo, Adam.

419
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
Trucker Tom here.

420
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Really busy lately.

421
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,680
And you haven't been putting out too many daily source codes.

422
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
And I understand that.

423
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,680
You know, for people that are in daily source,

424
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
source code withdrawal,

425
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,680
you might want to come and check my podcast out.

426
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Talk to Tom.

427
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Tom, you're like a, a price gouger, man.

428
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,680
It's like, I'm in crisis because I can't get a show out

429
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
and I use them.

430
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
So come listen to your show.

431
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
I love you.

432
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,680
I put out a daily podcast as every day.

433
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
As I possibly can.

434
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Once in a while, I'll toss videos into the feed.

435
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,680
Maybe once or twice a week.

436
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,680
But the rest of the time, I try to put out an audio podcast.

437
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,680
Come over and check me out.

438
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
You may like what you hear.

439
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
You know, warn you.

440
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,680
You may end up in the connection fits.

441
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,680
Now, Adam, I can't bring myself to say fuck you, Adam Curry.

442
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,680
So I'll just end this with fuck you.

443
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Socialism.

444
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Yeah, everybody.

445
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
Good job.

446
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Tom doing some awesome shit, man.

447
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Particularly is HD stuff.

448
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
If you're looking for some HD content,

449
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
because you've got an HD television,

450
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,680
and you just bored with all the crap that's out there.

451
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Check out Trucker Tom stuff.

452
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,680
I think you can get everything from Trucker Tom dot to podshow.com.

453
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,680
Federal judge ordered the White House to preserve copies of all of its email messages.

454
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,680
A move that the Bush administration lawyers had argued strongly against.

455
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,680
Yeah, why keep a record of anything?

456
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,680
The order came from Judge Henry H Kennedy Jr.

457
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,680
of the Federal District Court came in response to two lawsuits trying to determine

458
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,680
whether White House destroyed email messages in violation of federal law.

459
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Two private groups in filed suit, citizens for responsibility,

460
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,680
and ethics in Washington, and the national security archive,

461
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,680
say that five million messages have disappeared.

462
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,680
Judge Kennedy's orders directed at maintaining back-up tapes

463
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
that contain copies of messages.

464
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
How old fashion is this?

465
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Get a dot mac account, and just copy your email there.

466
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
You know, better what?

467
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
Why don't we just have the president use a Gmail account?

468
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,680
They'll never have to delete anything for space.

469
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
An easily searchable.

470
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Now that would be a great program.

471
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
Hi, it's Matt from Gamesweasel on this week's show.

472
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,680
We've got a fantastic review of Guitar Hero A3 Legends of Rock.

473
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,680
We've also got a review of Samus Aaron's latest adventure

474
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Metroid Prime 3 Corruption on the Wii,

475
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,680
and you're coming copies of Football Manager 2008 for the PC.

476
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,680
That's all at gamesweasel.btpotshow.com.

477
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Right, Matt.

478
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
Thank you.

479
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,680
I haven't seen the, I don't know if the video version of that is up yet.

480
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
That's awesome.

481
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,680
The video version of Gamesweasel just really, really rocks.

482
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
I'll check for you.

483
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,680
Let me see, do everything else that we should be talking about.

484
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Oh, yeah, the Hulu Beta.

485
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Just a quick follow-up on that.

486
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
You know, I still haven't received a beta access,

487
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,680
although I was kindly given one to go and check it out.

488
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
And I told you, it was really nothing special.

489
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,680
There are some people apparently who have a beta login.

490
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,680
And well, here's a report.

491
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,680
But I should say Hulu is NBC's answer to iTunes.

492
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,680
It took all of their shows off of iTunes,

493
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,680
and then they built this incredible video portal

494
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,680
that is just outrageously fantastically cool.

495
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
If you believe all the reports that came out a couple weeks ago,

496
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,680
and I found this report to be somewhat suspicious,

497
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,680
because well, quite honestly, no one I knew had a Hulu Beta login.

498
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,680
And it seemed like there was just too much positivity.

499
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
And I didn't read anything.

500
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,680
But any no bloggers were talking about it,

501
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
because they didn't have access.

502
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
So clearly, some things have.

503
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,680
The items are Tom calling from SoCal,

504
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,680
so I've got one area just listening to the D.A.R.

505
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,680
Who's my Friday?

506
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Well, listen to you talk about the Hulu,

507
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,680
that Hulu site should take joke as far as I'm concerned.

508
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,680
I still haven't got a beta,

509
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
and even to try it out.

510
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
But I think it's a ridiculous site,

511
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,680
because they're only allowing positive post.

512
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,680
No negative post, any time I tried to post,

513
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,680
just say something, or even to mention,

514
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,680
iTunes and a positive veteran,

515
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,680
and they're argument with NBC,

516
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,680
and iTunes between the Apple iTunes saying,

517
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
it's just not working.

518
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,680
You can't post anything as long as it's negative about their site,

519
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,680
and just think it's a ridiculous,

520
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,680
well, have a good one, and fuck you out.

521
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
I'm very glad to hear that.

522
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
Thank you.

523
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Big mistake, those guys are making.

524
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
Big mistake, because the content is,

525
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,680
of course, phenomenally good.

526
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,680
They produce fantastic stuff,

527
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,680
although I almost feel compelled to boycott it

528
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
since now, we're all painfully aware

529
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,680
that the writers receive zero money for this,

530
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,680
because NBC and other television and broadcast

531
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,680
and production companies call this type of online view,

532
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,680
and they call it promotional material.

533
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,680
It's not really someone being able to view a whole episode

534
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,680
of a series that eventually started with someone

535
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,680
writing down a story.

536
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,680
No, it's promotional activities.

537
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,680
So I should kind of boycott it regardless,

538
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
but the mistake is, you know,

539
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
you can build a community around these properties,

540
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,680
but that only works if you allow the community to flourish

541
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,680
and to talk freely, and if you start moderating,

542
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
it just doesn't work.

543
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Of course, you eventually, you know,

544
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
the people who are working on boards and forums do blow up,

545
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,680
especially if they're open.

546
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,680
It's even worse if you have moderators

547
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,680
who can take things off and ban people,

548
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,680
and it just, you know, it usually results in,

549
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,680
in a downward spiral of flames.

550
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
But you can certainly get something going.

551
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
It's good for a while,

552
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
so I think that's a huge mistake on their part.

553
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,680
At this week, it would be pretty messed up.

554
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,680
By this evening, I'll know if I'm going to San Francisco tomorrow

555
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,680
for this week and probably some,

556
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
if not all of the next,

557
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,680
it's also very possible that I don't leave until the weekend.

558
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,680
Again, it's just all the stuff we're trying to wrap up

559
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,680
before the end of the year.

560
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,680
So, God knows what it went, I'll be back.

561
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,680
I really hope I'm back in two weeks time

562
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,680
because both Patricia and I have a fun weekend

563
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,680
for the 30th of November and 1st of December.

564
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,680
One is a special, like a show

565
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,680
that Patricia has been asked to maybe perform in with a big band,

566
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
so we're going to take a look at the show

567
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,680
and see if she likes it, see if something she wants to get into.

568
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
And then there's a huge reunion.

569
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
This must be 30 years now, I guess.

570
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,680
20, 20, no, 20, yeah, almost 30 year reunion

571
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,680
of decibel radio in Amsterdam.

572
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
That's the pirate radio station.

573
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,680
I really started at Amsterdam.

574
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,680
And so they have a frequency, 94.9 in Amsterdam.

575
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
They have a legal frequency.

576
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
It's still a pretty local to do.

577
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
It can pretty much reach Amsterdam.

578
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,680
And then there's some parts of South Holland,

579
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,680
as we call it, the southern part of Holland.

580
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,680
So more like the Rotterdam area, not the Limburg area.

581
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,680
I can reach there as well.

582
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
I think they have another frequency.

583
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
And so they're doing a big party.

584
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,680
And it's going to be all the old DJs.

585
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,680
And of course, Ed just everyone who work at the station.

586
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,680
And some artists, and hopefully I can make that

587
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,680
because that would be a shame if I couldn't

588
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,680
hang out with all the old boys and girls.

589
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,680
Because that's exactly what we've become.

590
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Very old boys and girls.

591
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,680
Hey, Ed, I'm it's all you again from the German My Way Home podcast.

592
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,680
I'm just flying on this asshole calling in on DSC686

593
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
and complaining about your show.

594
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,680
This is the guy from fuckewatumcurry.com.

595
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,680
First of all, you're getting in money out of your business.

596
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Ed, I'm feel ashamed.

597
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,680
Get your ass into the corner and feel ashamed.

598
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,680
Really?

599
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,680
And you're putting advertising on podcasts to get a payback.

600
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Oh, my God, you're taking 30 seconds of his life time.

601
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Well, please be the kind and take 30 seconds of your life time

602
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,680
and tell this asshole where the fast-forward button is on his player.

603
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,680
And as Peter Macquat, the little brother of the Potio Potcasser

604
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,680
from tips from the top floor, Chris Macquat once said in his podcast,

605
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,680
when a listener complained about, I don't know what it was.

606
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
What do you want?

607
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Do you want your money back?

608
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
Yeah.

609
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
Listen to me, asshole.

610
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
This is free content.

611
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
If you don't like it, don't listen to it.

612
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,680
And don't take your time to make a show like fuckewatumcurry.com

613
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,680
and complain about a private done personal podcasting show,

614
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,680
like Adam does, but read it tutorial on the internet,

615
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
how the fast-forward button works.

616
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Okay?

617
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Adam fuckew and fuckew fuckew are imperative, Tom.

618
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Yo, yo.

619
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Yeah, right, man.

620
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,680
That's what that thing is for.

621
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,680
That little double arrow that heads toward the right points that way.

622
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
That is the fast-forward button.

623
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,680
If you're not liking it,

624
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,680
if you don't like the tunes, it's up to you.

625
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
That is true in directivity.

626
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,680
We stand alone on the edge of the forest,

627
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
wonder why this came to be,

628
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
running your pants to my head.

629
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
This leaves them loud,

630
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
they're like the jungle for forest,

631
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,680
but at least you see what you do in here.

632
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
The smell comes from there,

633
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
is none of this magic smell.

634
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,680
No, it's women, you're all in the air.

635
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,680
Chines are the place, the woman is dead.

636
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:16,680
You can make these problems disappear.

637
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:22,680
But you can't even out of me.

638
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,680
I wanted to get on it,

639
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
so we've got to be,

640
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,680
maybe give me a storm for free.

641
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,680
I can see your damn voice,

642
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
break your love,

643
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,680
that's what I like.

644
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,680
Break your love,

645
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,680
break your love,

646
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
that's what I like.

647
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,680
Break your love, yeah.

648
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,680
In terms of goals of sadness,

649
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
my love,

650
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
to maybe,

651
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
in terms of faster wolf,

652
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
the smell of the deceit of the bird.

653
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
I couldn't see you,

654
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,680
what's the looks you were after,

655
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,680
now you place me on your keyboard and shy.

656
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,680
I've never met you to your love,

657
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
but man, it's so brave,

658
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,680
and I know you never say no to me,

659
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,680
it's easy to see that you're crazy for this you look alive.

660
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
I don't care,

661
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
I don't care,

662
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
I don't care,

663
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
I don't care,

664
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
I don't care,

665
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
I don't care,

666
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
I don't care,

667
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
I don't care,

668
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
I don't care,

669
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
I don't care,

670
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
I don't care,

671
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,680
I don't care,

672
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
I don't care,

673
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
I don't care,

674
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
I don't care,

675
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
I don't care,

676
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
I don't care,

677
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
I don't care,

678
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
I don't care,

679
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
I don't care,

680
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
I don't care,

681
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,680
I don't care,

682
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
I don't care,

683
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
I don't care,

684
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
I don't care,

685
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
I don't care,

686
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
I don't care,

687
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
I don't care,

688
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
I don't care,

689
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
I don't care,

690
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
I don't care,

691
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
I don't care,

692
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
I don't care,

693
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
don't care,

694
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
I don't care,

695
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,880
Don't care,

696
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,680
I don't care,

697
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Break your love, that's what we like

698
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Break your love, get always looked so good

699
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,680
In a way, you love, it's a cover

700
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Break your love, get gross to make it easy

701
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,680
Guys, just act so crazy

702
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Math the time to seem so insane

703
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Oh, get it, I'm home

704
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,680
Oh, get it, I'm behind

705
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,680
To let it all at tonight

706
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Tonight, tonight, tonight

707
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,680
Boys, we'll be boys, we'll do nothing

708
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Boys, we'll be boys, we'll get shot

709
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,680
And the boys will be boys, we'll shout

710
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,680
And sing, boys, we'll be boys

711
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,180
And the feel, sure

712
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,180
And the aim, boys and girls

713
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,180
They do nothingblind, boys

714
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:10,280
Born, win, 20

715
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,280
Girls, we'll be boys, we'll do nothing shiny

716
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:38,960
Like until somebody heard a little bit too much during the run, each more organ is called

717
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,680
Tyler Burns, as Abtown Boys regular from the Podsafe Music Network of course, a link

718
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,600
to that in the share notes of dailysourcecode.com.

719
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,680
Crossposts of decorate.com and other FIMES scam websites across the interwebs.

720
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:03,520
All right, so let's leave it at that for today, I'm sure lots more, nice, nice

721
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
fade out.

722
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,080
I'm sure lots more will come in throughout the course of the day, planning on doing a

723
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,840
show tomorrow, unless of course I have to scurry off to Heathrow Brighton early, but I'll

724
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,240
