1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Fantastic.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a battle curry.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yo, it's the Daily Swasco 542.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's worthy of a wild thing.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Kiki de sil obstinatlic.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,700
Yeah, head, maybe a mess.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,500
It's just my turn because no one's home.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:46,500
I'm just sitting here running, now we're getting Friday long.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,500
I'm not getting through, I believe it's true

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,500
I believe it is, I'm in no way

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,500
I need to be left alone

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,500
To see you here, while I'm in my misery

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
I see you here, nothing in my life can bring me here

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,500
I say here, I'm further, can you help me?

18
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Hey, hey, hey, oh those crazy things I said

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
When he threw my head

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,500
As I like him and I still want him to spend

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,500
It's no use I swear I'm not getting up

22
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,500
No one, no one can get me out of this deeper world

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I need to be left alone

24
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,500
To see you here, while I'm in my misery

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,500
I see here, nothing in my life can bring me here

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,500
I say here, I'm further, can you help me?

27
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

28
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

29
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Oh how's it going to be?

30
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,500
I'm here, I'm further, can you help me?

31
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

32
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

33
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,500
I need to be left alone

34
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
To sit here

35
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
While I'm in my misery

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,500
I said he'd have to learn

37
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,500
To sit here

38
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,500
While I'm in my misery

39
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,500
I said he'd have to learn

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
To sit here

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Nothing in my life can bring me cheer

42
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,500
I said he'd have to

43
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Brother can you help me

44
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Interesting room noise there on the vocals

45
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
P.M. Brother can you help me

46
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Just join the Ponce of Music Network

47
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
They're from New York influences

48
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Well, it should be no surprise

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Led Zeppelin, no doubt, blondie heart

50
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Like it a lot

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
And even though there's no picture of the lead singer

52
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
On the Ponce of Music Network

53
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
There's one on their own website

54
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

55
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
It's Thursday

56
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
It is the 8th of February 2007

57
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
In the affluent suburb of Surrey

58
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Known as G-town on the west side

59
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Today would have been an aside

60
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Today would have been an historic

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Day in my personal history

62
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
As I was supposed to meet up with comic

63
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
I had in shortage London

64
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,500
I had in shortage London

65
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
I had in shortage London

66
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,500
The aliens or maybe somebody from the future

67
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Wanted to disturb our meeting

68
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,500
So my airplane has been returned in the air

69
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
I repeat in the air

70
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
I repeat in the air

71
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Because all London airports were closed due to the snow

72
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,500
And because in the continental airplanes from USA and Asia

73
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
I'm very sorry

74
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Here is Captain speaking

75
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
I'm very sorry

76
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Here is Captain speaking

77
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
And I have to learn what we have to coordinate

78
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
And we have to go back to London again

79
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
To reveal the echo

80
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,500
The last information we got to come

81
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Hold on

82
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Must let the airport travel on a little tip

83
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Close the boat

84
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,500
To London clock local time

85
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,500
And stand for 10 o'clock local time

86
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
To get big

87
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
But minor clock local time

88
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
The question is if they can accept us

89
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,500
For the flight back to London

90
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Due to the idiot boats

91
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Over the ocean from USA

92
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
All the earth got the metal flight

93
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
So we are

94
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
After a while we had the situation

95
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Other ground, please let us

96
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
I'll give us some time for that

97
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
We will get the information back

98
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Thank you

99
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
As I've turned my man

100
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Thank you

101
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
As I've turned my man

102
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
I'd like you to leave the aircraft

103
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
No buses waiting on the left hand side

104
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
For the information we get from our aircraft

105
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,500
We will be advocate for you

106
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
But we all airports

107
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Area of London are closed

108
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
So for the information we get there

109
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Thank you

110
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
So you can see Adam

111
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
That I couldn't do absolutely anything

112
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
I am very sorry

113
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
You

114
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Shaha

115
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Come Mr. Blogger

116
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
It's okay man

117
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
We have a saying in Holland

118
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
But the infot seat for your need

119
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
And that means

120
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
I don't want to try and translate that

121
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
It'll be okay

122
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
We'll work it out

123
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
So obviously due to snow on the ground

124
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Yeah, we got a couple inches here as well

125
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Not enough to deter the lady Patricia

126
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
From taking the roads throughout to have her nails done

127
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
As was the entire plan

128
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
In fact now

129
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
The sun is kind of breaking through here and there

130
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,500
And I think the worst of it may be over

131
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Which of course is important

132
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Because you know I have a trip scheduled for tomorrow

133
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
To to the Netherlands

134
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Now of course that may have to be postponed until Saturday

135
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,500
If it does then you know CSB could come back tomorrow

136
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
But you know it's like so much is up in the air

137
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
I think we're just waiting till after three GSM

138
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Which is the conference that comixer blogger is going to

139
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Not just CSB but

140
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
This is like the mobile phone conference I guess

141
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
So you'll have to listen to

142
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
What is it?

143
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Mobile phone

144
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Oh crap

145
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
What the hell is the name of that show that he does

146
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Anyway go to comixer blogger.com

147
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Comixer blog.com

148
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
As a link at curry.com

149
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
See you can find it

150
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
CSB I'm truly sorry my friend

151
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
I was really looking forward to it

152
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Everyone at the office was all excited

153
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
And all set and

154
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Bummer

155
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
But there's always a silver lining somewhere in the clouds

156
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Yes

157
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
It's like me back

158
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
It's time

159
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Once again

160
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
She must be

161
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Yes

162
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Adam

163
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
It's Amy man

164
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Hey Amy back

165
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
She's back

166
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Are you ready to ask her side

167
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Yeah we get the other mic up and running here

168
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Okay

169
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Today we're doing one like it's flat

170
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Okay

171
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
I want you to start standing tall

172
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Shoulders back

173
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
And squeeze the abs and butt

174
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Okay

175
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Now like your right leg and stick it out

176
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Straight in front of you

177
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Now squat with your left leg

178
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Go as far as you can and then come back up

179
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
You should really feel it in the legs and butt

180
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
And your abs should be keeping you from tipping over

181
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Now switch legs and stick out the left leg

182
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Okay

183
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
And then squat with your right leg

184
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Good

185
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Seven more on each side

186
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,500
You want to make sure that the ground of leg doesn't let the knee come over the toes

187
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Six

188
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Oh that's nice

189
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
You should have the weight in your heel

190
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,500
You almost want to sit back a little bit to counterbalance

191
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Okay I got it

192
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
I got it

193
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Oh yeah

194
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Breathe

195
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
I always forget to do that

196
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Keep it slow and control

197
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Yeah

198
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Slow

199
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Okay

200
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Nice

201
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Oh

202
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Oh man

203
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Great job

204
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Have you been practicing all your ascercising moves?

205
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Yes, yes, I have

206
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
I think we should start an ascercising campaign

207
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Our mission is to rid the world of saggy bottoms

208
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
What do you think?

209
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Well anyway, you know we're to find me

210
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
And until next time

211
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,500
I think we should go on a mission here, Amy Mack

212
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,500
To rid the world of saggy asses

213
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,500
And of course, ridding the world of saggy asses

214
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Starts at home

215
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
We're all alone by the way

216
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
There was no school today

217
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Oh Christina had her play last night

218
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Oh man this was so cool

219
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
This is extra

220
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Outside of the regular curriculum

221
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,500
The her drama teacher

222
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Had written this play

223
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Which was a very very complicated play

224
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,500
With multiple scenes, multiple times

225
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Crazy

226
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
I should have brought the program up

227
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
I should have read it to you

228
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Because it was like a bet that he made with a friend of his

229
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
That he could write a play

230
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
That included all five genres

231
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
And the ending had to be at the beginning

232
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
I mean, it's one of these right?

233
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Oh man

234
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Three hours

235
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Three and a half if you count the half hour intermission

236
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
No wonder the kids been home late every single night

237
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
From practicing this piece

238
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
It's an incredible long

239
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
But it was good

240
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Oh, we were a bunch of proud parents

241
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
It was so nice

242
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
As a couple of Christina's friends came

243
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Came down from up a little bit of North Alton

244
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
To come and watch the play

245
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Of course, Indiana was there

246
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
So it was a good time

247
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
No why am I mentioning that

248
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Oh yeah, because that's why

249
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Even though Christina has to do the play tonight

250
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
There was no school because of the snow

251
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
And as you know, the lady Patricia is

252
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Is out to doing her nails

253
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Yes, I got a call from a listener

254
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Who had stopped listening due to a very busy personal schedule

255
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Stop listening to podcasts in general, I believe

256
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,500
But he did specifically mention this program

257
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
The Cha Cha, the Charlie, the Daily Source Code

258
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Delta shared Charlie

259
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,500
And he asked for a recap of what had happened

260
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Since he stopped listening

261
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Which, of course, I said is quite a challenge

262
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
But Keith is here

263
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
And it seems from library

264
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
I've written a show yesterday

265
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Got call in English

266
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
I want to know everything that happened

267
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,500
I'm show for like the past four years or something

268
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Like he's called in customer service

269
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Asking for like always counter information

270
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Just going to sit on the ball on all day

271
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Or paying away

272
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,500
And so this message is for the guy

273
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
You called in, let's have a message

274
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,500
I got the load out

275
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,500
So Adam went back to California

276
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Then he went to London

277
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Then he went to California

278
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Then he went to London

279
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Then he went to France

280
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Then he saw your underpants

281
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
And then back

282
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
All right, okay

283
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
And then he went in and then

284
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Like a month ago

285
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
He bought everybody

286
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
And I bought that

287
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Listening to the show

288
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Stuff for you

289
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Because you are listening to a loser

290
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
And then he went

291
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
A body house

292
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Okay

293
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
And then he was going to go to

294
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Yo and then the government

295
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
And London said can't do it

296
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
So he went and bought

297
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Another house

298
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,500
And then now he owns like four of them

299
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
And then

300
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Got married again

301
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Now he's got like six wives

302
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
And then

303
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
He went

304
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
And then

305
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Along

306
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Loosen the train

307
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Thought you're going on tangent

308
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Okay

309
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
And then and now I saw his car

310
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Because he wants to buy a bigger airplane

311
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
And an airport

312
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
So

313
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
More stories

314
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Better not

315
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Don't ship any more like a

316
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Like you did

317
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Because now you got in just in time

318
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
He's given

319
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Everybody gets free music

320
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Because of Apple

321
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
And copyright

322
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
And Beatles

323
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
So

324
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
And that's it

325
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
And if you've been listening

326
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
You even know

327
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Got on keys from library

328
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
And that's all

329
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
So

330
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Keep from library

331
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
That's it

332
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Ow

333
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Shh

334
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Thank you so much man

335
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Absolutely

336
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Down to a tea

337
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Down to a tea

338
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
I think that's just about everything that happened

339
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Particularly the free iPods of everybody

340
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Yeah

341
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
You know I've been talking about this Nokia

342
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
And 800 internet tablet

343
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,500
And it's kind of a dual experiment

344
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
And it's working out quite well actually

345
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
You know the experiment was

346
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Can I live with just the tablet for

347
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
You know places where I would

348
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Not necessarily want to carry a laptop

349
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
And I was very

350
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
What should we say?

351
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Skeptic about using the on screen keyboard

352
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
And I've learned to use it

353
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Now this has been going on at the same time

354
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Of course that I've been sitting down

355
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
To do a number one

356
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Yeah, this is all part of our posh people

357
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Potty pigs

358
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
And of course not being a potty pig

359
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Also starts at home

360
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
So to appease the lady Patricia

361
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
I'm doing my appeasement

362
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
While sitting down

363
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Which of course goes very nicely

364
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Hand in hand I might add

365
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,500
With the just having the internet tablet there with you

366
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,500
So I know that there are a couple of developers

367
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
From the Memo project who are now listening to the show

368
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
You guys are doing awesome work by the way

369
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm I really haven't had time to dive into the community

370
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I'm not a programmer

371
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,500
But I do I can parse

372
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
And understand what's going on

373
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,500
In a developer based community

374
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
And

375
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
G potter which is a python variant

376
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Python being a programming language

377
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,500
A python variant of the original iPodter

378
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
That I wrote and of course

379
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
That many people picked up on

380
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Is now ported to the web to the internet tablet

381
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
So I had some problems actually

382
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Installing because you have to install python first

383
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
And it should be a one click operation

384
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
But there's this application manager

385
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
That had that make sure that all your libraries

386
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
And you're basically like like if you're on Windows

387
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Your DLLs and all that crap that you don't want to know about

388
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
That it's all up to date

389
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
And I was having some problems with that

390
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Craig helped me out by the way

391
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Thanks buddy, really appreciate it

392
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
So it was just kind of through trial and error

393
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
I had to uncheck some repository

394
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Excuse me, full jurors

395
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Gourmet coffee blends

396
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
With some wonderful splendour

397
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,500
So I had to change some of these repositories

398
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
And turn them off and then make for

399
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
You know one update I guess I got out of sync somehow

400
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
It's probably what happened so anyway

401
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
I'm got it all installed and fired up G-potter

402
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Which I was very excited about

403
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
And it works it absolutely works

404
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
But I was a little disappointed

405
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Because the main feature

406
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
The main feature of iPodter

407
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
As originally spec

408
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Was that it runs seamlessly in the background

409
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Once you've configured it it runs in the background

410
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
And it's just downloading stuff

411
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
You know whenever it's available

412
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
So particularly with the internet tablet

413
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Which already knows

414
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,500
How to connect to wireless networks when they're available

415
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
And activate stuff

416
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,500
You know what we're missing here is like an hourly scan

417
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,500
So really the interface which is not bad at all

418
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
If you're right now it's a manual download

419
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Essentially you subscribe to a podcast

420
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
I subscribe to my podshow plus channels

421
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Which is nice because

422
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,500
You know I was thinking we could do a couple of really groovy things with this

423
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Well let me just finish the thought here

424
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,500
So you know basically you're adding in

425
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Feeds manually

426
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
And then you select the feeds and you say download

427
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
And then you can watch the progress download

428
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
And then once it's downloaded it can play

429
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
But the whole beauty of this is it should just be running in the background

430
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,500
And when you go and check your subscriptions or your channels

431
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
I think channels will be much easier because

432
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,500
You know no small devices really meant for managing subscriptions

433
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,500
You know then it's just there if it's not there then it's not there

434
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
It may be downloading but it's not there it's not there

435
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,500
So we need some kind of I guess in the in the Unix world

436
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
We'd say we need a cron script to run

437
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Preferably configurable not everyone wants it running

438
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
An hour some people want it running at half an hour intervals

439
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Or maybe once a day

440
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,500
So you know I'd really love to to work on this particular version of iPot

441
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Here's the suggestion I have by the way

442
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
We have a an API

443
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Available

444
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Um for unantined foil headers

445
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,500
An API stands for application program interface

446
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
I think

447
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Essentially is how other programs can talk to the podshow

448
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Plus platform so based upon a login

449
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
username and password

450
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Um the system can spit back all the channels that you've created

451
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
So I have an on the go channel. I have a news channel. I have a talk channel. I have a tech channel

452
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:08,500
These are all very basic channels that I filled up with shows that you you add to a channel by by getting them

453
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,500
It's a little button called get it next to each show on on podshow.com

454
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,500
And you can add it to a channel right there from the show itself

455
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,500
It doesn't have to be on the podshow network. It can be an external show

456
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Just anything that is within the database

457
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Which is pretty big

458
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:30,500
So what if we modify g-potter just a little bit so you supplied your

459
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
Um

460
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Your podshow plus credentials and then it immediately spits back channels

461
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Now these channels you manage through the website

462
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Obviously because it's just not convenient to be cutting and pasting URLs into little boxes

463
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,500
So you'd manage that all at podshow plus and then um

464
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,500
You know then you get a kind of what it has now you just see here your channels and here's what's been downloaded from the channels

465
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Now you can find the API

466
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
And developer.podshow.com

467
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
And if you have any questions, please let me know because

468
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Essentially I'm just trying to get something working that I'd really like myself

469
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Yes, we continue our quest to find if

470
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Push people are potty pigs and Jochen Lily says add a mine of coins

471
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,500
DSC 540 had me in tears listening to you speaking German about good bathroom manners. You're right

472
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:35,500
The concept of sitting down to pee is a pretty strange concept to some men as you can see at this illustration. He has an interesting flicker link there

473
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,500
We're to put in the show notes, but if it's explained well a man can get used to it after a while I got used to it too

474
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Especially because it's my turn to clean the bathroom including the toilet every second week

475
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Jochen, is this what your wife makes you do?

476
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Ah, man those German women or something else, huh?

477
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,500
If you're just tuning into the daily source code you're wondering what this is about

478
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:08,500
We're trying to find out if people who are posh are larger potty pigs than others

479
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
And what we're finding out is that well

480
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Pretty much everybody seems to be a nasty potty pig

481
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Hey Adam, it's polo flarity here from oflarity.dk and I just wanted to send you a quick message

482
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:27,500
To let you know how things are here in Denmark we regard to posh people being potty pigs

483
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Now when I first came here the Denmark a couple of years ago

484
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:38,500
I used to work in bars and the one particular bar that I worked in because I was the new guy

485
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:46,500
I always got stuck with cleaning both the gents and the female toilets after you know a busy Saturday night

486
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:53,500
And I must say while the male toilet the gents toilet was absolutely terrible

487
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,500
I mean you know, pee everywhere, shite on the bowl, the whole night

488
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Shite not on the bowl on floor

489
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,500
It was nothing and I mean nothing in comparison to the female toilets

490
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,500
They were some of the most disgusting things I've ever seen

491
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,500
And I've got a new theory about this

492
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,500
First of all the running theory is that people are pigs in public bathrooms

493
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Because they know that at some point during the day or at least before the next business day

494
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Someone is going to be tasked with cleaning that

495
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,500
I'm just going to make an assumption here

496
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:38,500
That women possibly could be even larger potty pigs because they actually clean other people's shit at home

497
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
If they are family women

498
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,500
I would have to sit now not trying to be sexist or anything

499
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,500
But it's more than likely that more women clean crap out of toilets than men in western society at least

500
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
As far as I know

501
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Perhaps they're so fed up with doing that

502
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:02,500
That they're like I can't wait to make a mess in this bathroom because some other suck grass to clean it up

503
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Now

504
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Listening to

505
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
DSC

506
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,500
I can't remember her name but I heard woman talking from California

507
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
And she was talking about sanitary pills

508
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
She was talking about women poverty

509
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
You know it

510
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
I'm going to stop this comment

511
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
First of all it's really long

512
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
I appreciate the calling from Denmark

513
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
But it gets pretty gross

514
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
You even grossed me out dude

515
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
I have some some some other outlets

516
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Burning question which I've been interacting for quite a while

517
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,500
I haven't tried to play the traditional or any other

518
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Any other demo of Jeff Smith and he leaves you a long one

519
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,500
And I want to hide it

520
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
And I want to how does it work

521
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Does Jeff create a big loop for you as you just keep playing playing playing

522
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Just by the end of your comments or your topic

523
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
And for some of you it's too like

524
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
The end of six

525
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
So do you know what I mean?

526
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,500
It's like well it's the first half of the intro to Trinity

527
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
They have a long time

528
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Exactly just a music

529
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
And they have like yeah

530
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
How does it fit?

531
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
It's three parts of the jingle

532
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
How does it work?

533
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Can you elaborate on that?

534
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Because I'm preparing my new podcast thing

535
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Or a menu card

536
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
I just thought

537
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Hey let's do exactly the same as yours

538
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Buy a car and give it a website

539
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,500
So it's calledmyfuse70.com

540
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Which is my new 24th

541
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
But where is the Volvo G70?

542
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Which is coming up that was the one with the origami roof

543
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Y'all

544
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,500
So if you work for five years to get a car

545
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Get a website

546
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Never mind

547
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
I didn't go get it

548
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,500
But I should

549
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
Bye

550
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
I do

551
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,500
This is like asking David Copperfield to tell you how he makes the elephant disappear

552
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Or the statue of Liberty

553
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,500
I mean you know

554
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,500
You're basically saying how do I do it that I time it so perfectly

555
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Every single time and put it in all the comments

556
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Well it's a quite a process

557
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,500
The Jeff and I go through to make these things exactly the right length

558
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:21,500
And if you believe that, well my friend

559
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Hey Siri said I'd listeners

560
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
We'll talk to you tomorrow for Fubar Friday

561
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Bye bye

562
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Let me see what I should do here

563
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
You know I

564
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Oh here's here

565
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Let me talk about this

566
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
The couple of things I wanted

567
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
I'll move some stuff towards tomorrow

568
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,500
I found an awesome show at PodShow Plus

569
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
You have to check out

570
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
It's Girls Gone Weed

571
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,500
It's a ggdub.podshow.com

572
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
That's Gulf Gulf Delta Uniform Bravo

573
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
Ggdub.podshow.com

574
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
They've got some awesome videos

575
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Basically it's cute girls smoking weed

576
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
In pipes and bongs

577
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,500
And welcome to the network ladies

578
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
I'm totally loving it

579
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
And there's something I wanted to try out with y'all

580
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,500
And I only wanted to do it with the listeners to the podcast

581
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Not the series satellite radio listeners

582
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,500
This is some software company in the UK pitched me on this

583
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,500
And they essentially pitched me to see if we would want to integrate it into podshow

584
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Plus

585
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
A lot would have to happen

586
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
But it's pretty interesting

587
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
It's a very basic functionality

588
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
In essence you get a phone number

589
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
Where people can send a text message to

590
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,500
And the software on the back end will count votes

591
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
Yeah, exactly

592
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Kind of like our own little mini american idol

593
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Only I don't want to use it that way

594
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
What I wanted to do is I wanted to ask

595
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Those of you listening if you have a mobile phone

596
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
A mobile

597
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
If you wouldn't mind texting

598
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
Whether you're a scruncher

599
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Or a folder

600
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
So that we have a real running tally

601
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,500
And it doesn't matter when you text this in

602
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
If you do it now or if you do it tomorrow

603
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Because the software will just keep tracking

604
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Those that particular campaign I guess you call it

605
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,500
Now because it's a demo system

606
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
There's only one phone number

607
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,500
So you have to add AC as a pretext

608
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
So let me explain

609
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
So you get ready to compose a new message

610
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
And SMS message to text message

611
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
And you send and of course the number will be on the show notes

612
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
But you sent you want to send it to plus four four

613
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Seven eight one four

614
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Three three eight

615
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Five nine

616
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Zero

617
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
And then in the message you want to start off with AC

618
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
As an alpha Charlie

619
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Space

620
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
And then put in folder or scruncher

621
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Depending on your preference

622
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
So text

623
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
AC space

624
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
And then folder or scruncher

625
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
To plus four four

626
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Now the plus of course is for your external access

627
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
It will work in every country

628
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
So do plus four four

629
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Seven eight one four

630
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Three three eight five nine zero

631
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
And I will be posting

632
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
A graph

633
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Yes, I will

634
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,500
A graph of folders versus scrunchers

635
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
That listen to the daily source code

636
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Hey Adam, this is Alan Briss and Gospel

637
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Just finished my daily commute

638
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Listening to DSC 541

639
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,500
I'm very interested to hear what you're saying about Apple and DRM

640
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
And couple of funny things happened

641
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,500
After I finished listening to DSC

642
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Finished halfway through my journey

643
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Alan Rigby by the Beatles came onto my right bottom

644
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
And followed by that

645
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
I killed you playing on your show before

646
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
They're still in wait

647
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
And she played a song called

648
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Bound

649
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
And I couldn't help but think

650
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
She's singing about DRM

651
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
So have a listen

652
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
See what you think

653
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Seems very spooky to me

654
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
But maybe she's actually talking about

655
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Blocks, I don't know

656
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
And anyway, that's to Apple

657
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,500
And this whole thing about the packaging

658
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
I certainly thought swatches

659
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
You know, you write about every week

660
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,500
New style, new colours

661
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
It's got to be happening

662
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,500
I think you're writing it's a very exciting time

663
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Next

664
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Yeah, I don't know

665
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Nextive months is going to be

666
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,500
A very interesting time for the music industry

667
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
So keep it up

668
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Love the free currency

669
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
And all of that

670
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
If you need anybody to write across Switzerland

671
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Drop me a line

672
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500

And yeah, hold it

674
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Okay

675

Yep, make sure you

Make sure you text it in

678
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
And of course, we need people to drive

679
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500

Hey Adam, it's Derek from Sydney

684
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,500
I've kind of piled up all my comments together

685
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Just like Charles the Drunk Londoner

686
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Oh, come on now

687
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
You can never compare yourself

688
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
The Charles the Drunk Londoner

689
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
He is completely unique

690
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
I accept I'm not drunk

691
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,500
I'm just so tired it feels like my face is going to fall off

692
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
And you're like not from London

693
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
You're pronouncing things

694
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,500
I work with a palm pomegranate girl

695
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
I got to explain pomegranate

696
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
That's what

697
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,500
That's what down and that's what they call the people from the UK

698
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
Pum

699
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Prisoner pomegranate

700
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Prisoner of Mother England

701
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
In other words, you have not yet escaped

702
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Like me, I'm a pomegranate

703
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Even though I'm a young pomegranate

704
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
I'm a young pomegranate

705
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
The candy store I work at

706
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,500
And I was asking her how she says I ate it

707
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
And she said I ate it

708
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
I said yeah

709
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
She said I ate it

710
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
I ate it

711
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Oh wow

712
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
If I didn't know what we were talking about

713
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
I would be totally confused

714
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
So she ate it

715
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
And I guess that's just

716
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
They're dialect

717
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
They just have reminded me of

718
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
A little Britain

719
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,500
Anyway

720
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
I remember you said herb

721
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
That's a funny man

722
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,500
That's the wacky woman from the asylum

723
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Who smears shit on everything

724
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Yeah

725
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
It sounded just like it

726
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
That just struck a chord in my brain

727
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
Where

728
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,500
In Australia we say herb

729
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Well, that's great

730
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,500
We don't only say you hate it all

731
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
Like if you hear someone doing that on a game show

732
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Like we love fortune

733
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
It just sounds very

734
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
I don't know

735
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Not good

736
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
And

737
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Well my mum's American

738
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
So I know a bit of the American language

739
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,500
And I'm just always known it's be herb in America

740
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Like just drop the age

741
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Kind of

742
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
Signage or whatever

743
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
So yeah

744
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
I also tried to get some folgers

745
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Free coffee, gourmet selection

746
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Being from the website

747
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
And that's US residents only

748
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
Ah bummer

749
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
Yeah bummer

750
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
I got excited

751
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
But then I got disappointed

752
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Anyway

753
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
And Trinity

754
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Well she has to come to Australia

755
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Because we're

756
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
We're trying to be

757
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Environmentally friendly

758
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
And stuff like that

759
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
And podcasting is sort of taking off

760
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
It's becoming independent

761
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
And all that kind of thing

762
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
And well mainly

763
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
We have to get our going across the harbor bridge

764
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
It's

765
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
The bridge is 75th

766
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
But they, I think that would be a great

767
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
But they present for this

768
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
The harbor bridge

769
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
You know, Trinity

770
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Well that's for me

771
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
All our

772
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Shaking later when

773
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
I have a face that actually works

774
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Take it

775
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
I'm a folder

776
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Sorry

777
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Sorry for the pilot error there

778
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
You know, Trinity

779
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,500
I was going to say Trinity

780
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Doesn't have a very good record

781
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
When it comes to bridges

782
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
So we may want to reconsider that

783
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Please sign up at the Google Group

784
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
For free Trinity

785
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
DailySourceCode.com

786
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
As we can find all the links in the show notes

787
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
That was down yesterday

788
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Or it wasn't down

789
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
DailySourceCode.com

790
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
And other custom domain names

791
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
All of a sudden we're pointing to

792
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
The Podger.com homepage

793
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
I don't know how long it was like that

794
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
But I got a couple messages

795
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
And sent it through

796
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Engineering through our critical list

797
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
And it was fixed within

798
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Within no time

799
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
Literally

800
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,500
But I'm still trying to figure out

801
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
If it affected more people

802
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
If you notice it

803
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,500
It's fixed now

804
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
That's for sure

805
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
What's this thing I saw about

806
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Ask an engine

807
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Do you watch the Ask an Injip podcast?

808
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
I love it

809
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,500
And I think everyone loves the Ask an Injip podcast

810
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Apparently

811
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
He's built up his audience

812
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Online

813
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
At his Myspace page

814
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Or at least a significant audience

815
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
And he wrote this

816
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
This was a couple days ago

817
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
I think it was end of last week

818
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,500
That he hosts all of his video

819
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
At REVER

820
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
And that

821
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
Anything any link to REVER

822
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,500
In fact, even the words

823
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
REVER

824
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
If you type it into a blog post

825
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
Or if you put it into your profile

826
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
On my space it gets deleted

827
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
That's fucked up

828
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
You know that's like

829
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
That's like

830
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
DRM

831
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
You know that's like

832
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,500
The media version of DRM

833
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
That's so completely wrong

834
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,500
It just doesn't make any sense to me

835
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,500
You know

836
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,500
I haven't really proved over and over and over again

837
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
That letting people link all over the place

838
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Is really what works

839
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
It's just surprising to me

840
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Anyway

841
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
No surprise

842
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
I was going to play this one for you

843
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Because we've got to give you another updates

844
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
As Trinity is ready to

845
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
ROWL

846
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
Driving across the USA

847
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,500
Open to make a good time today

848
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500
I feel like I've been watching you

849
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Letting everybody know

850
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,500
That this is going to be the better way

851
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
You can't help but sing along at this point

852
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Trinity

853
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
Trinity

854
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
The quintessential luxury

855
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Trinity

856
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Trinity

857
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,500
Let the bio diesel set you free

858
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,500
I

859
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,500
We've got drivers who are offering their services from coast to coast

860
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Some of them are celebrities

861
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Hey, I'm em, it's Callie

862
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
I love what you're doing with free Trinity

863
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
So I just wanted to let you know

864
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,500
If she takes a trip through Texas or even down Route 66

865
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
I'd love to do something

866
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
I could drive or as you know, I have a diesel car

867
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
And we used bio-willy diesel

868
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,500
So I could follow behind and shoot some HD footage

869
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
And I don't know, whatever you need, I'm in

870
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Just let me know

871
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
With a reason of course

872
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
No naked picture, sorry

873
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
By the way, I'm a soldier

874
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Of course you're a soldier

875
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,500
No naked pictures

876
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
How disappointing

877
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,500
Thank you Doug Program for pointing free Trinity.com

878
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,500
To free Trinity.podshow.com

879
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:35,500
And he's still trying to find the perfect car for me in San Francisco

880
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,500
Dude, I'm just going to buy some POS that just runs

881
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,500
You know, if I can find a little more modern diesel

882
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
I'm happy to do that

883
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500
But my days of really caring about the car that I drive

884
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
I have to say are really long gone

885
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
It's just it doesn't excite me anymore

886
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
I really know I'll get an old

887
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Hi Adam

888
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,500
Yes, please bring Trinity over to Germany

889
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Or as your friend in Abu Dhabi, put it

890
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Trinity comes home

891
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
And while I'm at it

892
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
German fans of the Charlie

893
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
And I'm sure they are a good number

894
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
You bet there are

895
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,500
I'm here, I'm a podcast entity here in Munich, Germany

896
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,500
I live in a two-minute driving distance of a station

897
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Where you can get exclusively vegetable oil

898
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Here near the Technical University of Munich

899
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,500
And I would gladly pick up Trinity's say in Brussels

900
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Where my wife was born

901
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,500
And driver over here to Munich or a pick up in Munich

902
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500
And driver to Franco in Belaitalia

903
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
So let me say one more thing

904
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Folder

905
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Or naturally

906
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Good to fat

907
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Yeah, good to fat

908
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
And now you can laugh your ass yourself

909
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Brits

910
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
Fart of the New Goodmaner point

911
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Yep

912
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
You know, is that awesome

913
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,500
That everyone who's calling in from around the world

914
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
They all are aware of biodiesel

915
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
And they know where to get it

916
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,500
I mean, this is so much bigger than I anticipated

917
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Barbara Palo Alto

918
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Podcaster is working hard on the Google Greg

919
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,500
That was yeah, it's in bad

920
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
On the Google Group

921
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Ah

922
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Okay, she put a link on the main page of the Google Group

923
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
So people can join Teen Trinity

924
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
By sending an email message

925
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Stating name location

926
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
How they want to be involved in the project

927
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,500
And that's you can send that to free Trinity at gmail.com

928
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,500
And she's been receiving a number of

929
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
That's interesting

930
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
She's calling them invitations

931
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
Which I kind of like

932
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,500
It's an invite for Trinity to come by your neck of the woods

933
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,500
So if you're really serious about it, please send off an email

934
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
To free Trinity at gmail.com

935
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,500
But definitely jump into the conversation over at the

936
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,500
The Google Group for free Trinity

937
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
One thing we do not have yet is

938
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Well actually, we need more yanks

939
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
More people from the states

940
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,500
And so far, no full suggestions for music venues

941
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,500
So, and I like this, you know, this part of the

942
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
Of the plan very much is, you know,

943
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,500
To try and coordinate stops where

944
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Podsate music artists may be performing

945
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Or where there's some kind of, you know,

946
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Some kind of venue where podcasters are involved

947
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
So that we can spice it up a bit

948
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
So get your asses on over to groups.google.com

949
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Slash group slash free Trinity

950
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
You can just go to data source.com

951

Click on the link in the show notes

952
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Oh, boom, boom, boom

953
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,500
I think it has something to do with the weather

954
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
But I'm really messing through

955
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
Trinity, Trinity

956
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500

Trinity, Trinity

958
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500

This is a win valuable prizes

963
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
I'm telling you man, ever since Ever since he asked me

964
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
How, how I actually do that

965
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
How I close those loops I'm freaking out

966
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
I can't seem to do it anymore

967
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,500
That's why this song is so perfect for me

968
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Or today, I'm an asshole

969
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,500
I know you got aspirations

970
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Can be a new boss one day

971
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Who put that stick up your ass anyway

972
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,500
Yeah, yeah

973
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
Post a phone for company cast

974
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,500
Restoration, we travel and you kiss the crowd

975
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Go TV just by making a whole face

976
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,500
Round

977
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
This is the manager company boy

978
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,500
You sat with that fuck

979
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
And you're a asshole

980
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,500
It's kind of like you very much

981
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
That water cooler might look better

982
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Stop right up your butt

983
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
There's already an asshole

984
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
I can't believe you're still employed

985
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
There's a stop for business

986
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
But be one that can't break

987
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
There's already an asshole

988
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,500
There's already an asshole

989
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
You're speaking out

990
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Everyone's business

991
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,500
You stay a little hell out of mind

992
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,500
You know it'll come back to find you in time

993
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
Yeah

994
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,500
Well, I'm not just telling everyone here

995
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
And not that little thing

996
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
I know about you

997
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,500
I got you in the clouds

998
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,500
It's been blue

999
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
And the lighting is shaping the copyright

1000
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
And when the CEO tells you that

1001
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
You're a asshole

1002
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
It's kind of like you very much

1003
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
That water cooler might look better

1004
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Stop right up your butt

1005
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
There's already an asshole

1006
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
I can't believe you're still employed

1007
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
There's a stop for business

1008
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
But be one that can't break

1009
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
There's already an asshole

1010
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
You're an asshole

1011
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,500
You must be

1012
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
Made it to someone

1013
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,500
It's the only way you could have got here

1014
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Underqualified

1015
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,500
The statement of the year

1016
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
A left handed rabbit package

1017
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:14,500
A fancy to the job better than you

1018
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,500
You could even prove a thing

1019
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Oh

1020
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,500
The statement is present that I've ever met

1021
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,500
And I just want to ring your goddamn neck

1022
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Cause you're an asshole

1023
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,500
It's kind of like you very much

1024
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
That water cooler might look better

1025
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Stop right up your butt

1026
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
There's already an asshole

1027
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
I can't believe you're still employed

1028
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
So the company's not looking at me

1029
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
But be one that can't break

1030
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,500
You're an asshole

1031
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,500
You're an asshole

1032
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,500
There's some matter for you

1033
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,500
But hopefully no one in this room

1034
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,500
But if you're not singing then it's true

1035
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,500
That I'm singing this hair song about you

1036
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
And you're an asshole

1037
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
And I don't like you right there in touch

1038
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
That water cooler might look better

1039
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Stop right up your butt

1040
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
There's already an asshole

1041
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
I can't believe you're still employed

1042
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
So the company's probably damaged

1043
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
But be one that can't break

1044
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
There's already an asshole

1045
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
You're an asshole

1046
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
Oh yes

1047
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,500
That's right

1048
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
For today I am

1049
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,500
You're an asshole

1050
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
From the pod tape music network

1051
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
From roadside attraction

1052
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
They've got more gems like that

1053
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
A 41 42 minutes perfect timing

1054
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Once again

1055
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
I'm going to get out of here

1056
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Remember to text in your

1057
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Your preference

1058
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Scrunching or folding

1059
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,500
And tomorrow I'll be back with the

1060
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,500
Well it kind of depends on the weather

1061
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,500
If I look outside right now

1062
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
There's going to be no flying tomorrow

1063
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
So it may be the

1064
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Football Friday edition early

1065
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
Or I'll turn to believe the football

1066
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Friday edition late

1067
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
One way or another

1068
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,500
We'll talk to each other

1069
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
