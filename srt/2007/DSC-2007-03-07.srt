1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Hey there, Adam is here's blue, blue wittaker, you might remember me from when we went

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,960
school together here in West Virginia. We know Adam I've been listening to you show for

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,800
a while and I just had to take some of your advice and listen to them commercials about

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,960
Splimba. And you know my wife, Sue Ellen, was she been wondering about how to keep her

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,720
weight down. So we decided that we'd make the last batch of moonshine with Splimba. I

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,920
say what that tastes pretty good there and then I'm moonshine and you can't really tell

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,320
you not using real sugar in there. That's Splimba tastes just good and moonshine

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,960
in a world where he's using his passion. What, what Ernie said mash, yeah, I said

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,840
mash and now Ernie was here mash up. So you know, he'd been listening for a while too.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,640
So if you take care now, Adam, you keep a rod in here and keep it at a 5.5.8, the DSC

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,240
5.5 A are rolling with some Splimba. The daily source code with Adam courage. It's my

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,200
art being able to choose the music that I want to play for you is virtually Nirvana.

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,200
It's musical for my voice. I love the cowbell on it. Oh, it's sweaty. It's really

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,200
want to look that leg and squeeze the butt. It's a good now. It's geeky goodness. I mean,

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,440
just start this thing up on a command line and then lock that puppy down. You know,

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,400
that's about all this need. It's low. You're supposed to be my trophy wife and I can just

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,280
see it now. And it's all for you. It's my job to entertain you. And if that means going

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,280
to jail, so be it.

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,280
I've seen a lot of the rings, seven to three times so far.

20
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:59,280
I've seen a lot of the rings. I've seen a lot of the rings. I've seen a lot of the rings.

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,280
I've seen a lot of the rings. I've seen a lot of the rings. I've seen a lot of the rings. I've

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:16,080
seven to three times so far. There's real induction in my radio. It does great thing.

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,280
I've seen a lot of the rings. I'm seven to three times hit in the middle of all.

24
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,120
I'm the section of my lady here that does great things with her

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,560
I'm getting nervous, but at least I'm learning how to run

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,080
But I was not falling in the data

27
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,920
Can't do myself to go with her

28
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,440
I won't ever think of her

29
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,880
I won't ever think of her

30
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,760
I won't ever think of her

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,320
I won't ever think of her

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,640
There's a magic level in the barely heats up my suit

33
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,600
I just put it on high and I sit and watch my flowers drip

34
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,320
And the fridge works great and last year was something that's really cold

35
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,040
But just that he's on the break out every with my cracked cereal board

36
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,760
It hours and a phone didn't give a mad at him

37
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,360
Can't do myself to go with her

38
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,880
I won't ever think of her

39
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,240
I won't ever think of her

40
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,280
I won't ever think of her

41
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,840
I won't ever think of her

42
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,680
I won't ever think of her

43
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,280
It's a happiness, it's one in what you already have

44
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,720
But we won't all this crap

45
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,080
It might have looked good back in 1997

46
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,480
It's an obstacle for us, for a credit can sum yeah

47
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:40,240
And the end you are what you possess

48
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,960
You could be like a desert though

49
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
You could complete leaps, yes

50
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,360
Last night I let it sleep out of the colours up on the night

51
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,800
But when the mattress collapsed I decided to sleep on the floor instead

52
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,960
But I was enough on any given day

53
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,960
And I can't put myself to throw you away

54
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,400
I won't ever think of her

55
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,960
I won't ever think that I won't ever think of her

56
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,520
I have to hurry up now

57
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,240
I won't ever think of her

58
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,440
I won't ever think of her

59
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,400
I won't ever think of her

60
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,360
I won't ever think of her

61
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,360
I won't ever think of her

62
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,240
Alec Berlin, everything I want

63
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,040
Kick an off-dairy source code episode 558 coming to you from the Aflu and Suburb of Surino

64
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,800
As Guilford, West Side of G-town G, G-town represent

65
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,200
They do have a G squad or something according to Christina

66
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,240
Yeah, we got gangs here, absolutely, from the curry manner

67
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,760
My name is Adam Curry, how are you doing everybody? Welcome to the daily source code

68
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
For strange day, start off a little bit weird

69
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
I was up here

70
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,360
My regular time going through the email from San Francisco which came in of course overnight and sending out emails

71
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,000
Which I love doing because when everyone wakes up this morning in San Francisco my email will be on top of the stack

72
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Worked out so well

73
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Just I was just about ready to do all the

74
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,360
Serious satellite radio recording stuff which I also do every every single day and

75
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Patricia says oh

76
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,760
What do you mean oh it's flowing? I'm like oh crap, you know

77
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,000
We've actually had some issues with one of our showers

78
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
It's a brand new shower, but something with the

79
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,760
Something with the tubes there's a series of tubes running through the manner that is wrong

80
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,640
And so I'm like oh man this is gonna suck it's gonna be completely flooded downstairs

81
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,680
What it happened was she had a nose bleed

82
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,680
Which is not a not a horrible problem of course you know and it happens very rarely and I've never

83
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
I think I've ever seen her get a nose bleed

84
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,320
No, I'm not that I can think of we're not there's just not nose bleeders really and

85
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,800
But because she takes all this medicine this cardiac medicine so she has blood thinners and

86
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,240
And stuff to keep her blood pressure low and

87
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,120
All kinds of fucking poison she has to take you know her blood is really thin and so it was man

88
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,560
It was like her her nose had been shot off. You know it was like I was watching

89
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,280
Crime scene after just paper towel after paper towel filling up with filling up with blood and oh

90
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
It was not okay

91
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,320
And it just wouldn't stop so I took her to the doctor

92
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,840
And of course when you're at the doctor's office and this has been bleeding like 40 minutes at this point

93
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,320
You know that's of course when it when it stops magically

94
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,240
But it turns out you know besides the obvious ways to stop and those lead which is first

95
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,760
So don't tilt your head back and I look this up on web and D dot com as well and the and the doctor verified

96
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,040
She thought my my medical knowledge was quite to vast

97
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,160
Don't tilt your head back in fact tilted forward a little bit and you really have to pinch the bridge of your nose

98
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,520
Quite quite firmly in fact for 10 minutes. I really doesn't help

99
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,040
But what does help tremendously if you just get some

100
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Vix like sinus spray

101
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,480
I think was Vix

102
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,800
Synex or Vix a camera which one and it's just over the counter stuff you spray that in and immediately goes to work by

103
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:42,640
Shrinking all the blood vessels inside your nose which of course really helps stop stop the bleeding and and actually will keep it stopped

104
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,680
So

105
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,920
That's just a handy little tip from the curry manner and an exciting morning

106
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
In Adams attic

107
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,120
Yesterday I just might mention this you know I was going to go to my

108
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,920
My

109
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,600
mouth hygienist my dental health professional Beverly

110
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,240
So you have got Fiona who does all the heavy lifting and all the the crap work and who's actually going to be working on my teeth this summer

111
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
We have a little plan some things I want to improve

112
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,960
I'm not a really big hero honestly when it comes to comes to dental work

113
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,840
But I do like going to Beverly a Beverly

114
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,200
Clean's my teeth and you know what she said she said wow

115
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,600
Wow, I'm really impressed this is your mouth is really healthy and clean and and I said come over here baby

116
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Prepare man coming after you

117
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,520
Making a rare appearance before the closing of the side like window PW Fenton checks in and what I talked about yesterday with juice

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,040
Or as I think I just have to call it by it's by its proper name. Yost from now and we're calling it yost okay

119
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
It's not juiced through that it's yost

120
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,920
If you're going to pick that name, I'm going to pronounce it properly

121
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,120
Finally a Dutch name and a product that is known worldwide and we're going to miss pronounced it no used it's juiced

122
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,960
Yost

123
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Yost

124
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,240
So here was my hypothesis yesterday that because of the enormous amounts of bandwidth that this program

125
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,720
Gobbles up while it gives you a fabulous experience. I don't want to discount that because it really is quite amazing

126
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
It's they say

127
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,480
On the install it even gives you some tips and pointers and some warnings about the amount of bandwidth is going to slurp

128
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,280
500 megabytes per hour

129
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:56,960
Which is quite a bit and I think will be very strenuous on most DSL networks and even cable networks and in fact

130
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,000
Gobbling up a lot of bandwidth in direct competition with initiatives that the telco's

131
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,000
The phone companies who are rolling out things such as IPTV and cable companies who have their own digital strategies

132
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,520
And of course are able to move video quite efficiently over there

133
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,720
You have seen at work. I think oh I don't want to sound technically in a depth here

134
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,560
So a pdob checked in about the whole yost conversation and his experiences with it

135
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,920
Yol

136
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
I love the fact that

137
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,600
Comic strip blogger has his own sort of branding

138
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
He go at him. This is pdob

139
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,640
So far I've had a very different experience with juiced or yost

140
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,640
As you very well know because podshow pays for it. I have a huge pipe

141
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
All right, all right, I know what I mean

142
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,320
I get five gigs in two gigs out. Oh pdob you must mean megs. It can't be gigs

143
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,000
We've supplied you with far too much pipe if it's gigs and thank you should be supplying someone that pipe over here

144
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,920
Pdob past me your pipe. That's a huge pipe

145
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,360
I also have one of these super fast cord duo computers with the fancy video card

146
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,200
So theoretically I should be able to handle almost anything

147
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:24,560
So far every attempt to watch juiced or yost is just starts and stops stutters and glitches

148
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,760
This of course doesn't make any technical sense

149
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,080
I think you anticipated exactly what's going on here

150
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,640
My huge pipe is owned by time Warner

151
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,480
So my guess is that they're putting the squeeze on the yost stream

152
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,400
I normally can stream HD content

153
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,320
So this is the only explanation for yost not working that makes any sense to me

154
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,840
What do you think? Yeah, man, I think you may be very right. I think it's called package shaping

155
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,920
There's a way for for routers to look at the

156
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
different types of packets and then

157
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,760
Send it off a little bit. It's it's the net neutrality happening before you're very eyes and I have to say I'm not going to stand up and

158
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:20,000
Shout that yost is being screwed because I understand the the conflict here and I have a

159
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,960
I would think that as mainstream as the deals that yost is making right now that there may very well be several

160
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,120
Telco operators who have already licensed mainstream content to put into their network

161
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,680
Maybe trying to to work with yost to use their platform instead. It's very very possible

162
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,040
I'd keep my eye on that but it will be of course mainly mainstream content

163
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,360
We're still working on getting a pod show channel in yost. I think we have a pretty good shot

164
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,360
Well, I think about it, but it you know, it'll they'll probably only want video and not very much it's a very similar to a deal

165
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,920
We have worked out with Tivo where we're going to enable a number of of of of of or some programming on on Tivo

166
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,800
And it will come through in a real television experience mainly because we are uploading that an MPH2 to Tivo

167
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,240
And it gets stored at their head and then all kinds of crap like that so

168
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,560
But you know, when it comes to net neutrality, you focus on this one watch this one very closely because

169
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,240
Essentially yost is of course a mainstream content

170
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,760
Distributor or package or I should say it's probably better and

171
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:32,400
And they have licensed content and the same content perhaps even exactly the same content as licensed the Telco and cable operators

172
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,360
But yost yet yost is you know not centralized as far as I understand it's it's decentralized so it's appear to peer

173
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,000
Network which is why it's passing through about 150

174
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,720
Megabytes per hour of bandwidth onto the next person I guess

175
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Food for thought food for thought for sure

176
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
We just check the

177
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,080
By the way, something I want to try I hope I can remember to do this I want to put one of my channels

178
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,040
I want to publish that now of course you can go to

179
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,440
Adam.podshow.com and you can see all of my channels

180
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,840
Right now we don't have an easy way for you to just click that and and put it into your into your iTunes or into any other

181
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:23,680
You know, maybe your mobile phone. I do that a lot. I have the Nokia podcasting a pod catching application. I should say

182
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,600
You could literally it's just an RSS feed so you can use it anywhere, but it's a very dynamic one because it updates from

183
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,480
Multiple sources and it's kind of cool, you know, then you'll be listening to the same thing. I'm listening to

184
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,280
And you'll get a little bit of a look into my mind

185
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,440
This is a pretty interesting story that came in from Ola, Ola Christian Valle who sent this to me

186
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,280
And a guy is now suing I think Microsoft I'm just pulling up the story here

187
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,880
Let's see Michael Allen Crooker currently in jail in Connecticut a fine-up standing citizen says that security features

188
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,840
Advertise by Microsoft and his business partner should have kept federal agents from accessing the files on his PC

189
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,840
In court papers filed this week in Massachusetts, Superior Court Crooker says that he suffered great embarrassment

190
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:18,080
as a result of Microsoft's failure to keep the FBI's prime eyes off of his computer and he's suing them for $200,000

191
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Let me explain

192
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Crooker purchased a compact presario

193
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
presarium PC

194
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,520
loaded with windows

195
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,880
I said presarium

196
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,800
loaded with the XP and I'd explore several security utilities in a 2002 at a circus city in

197
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
in Massachusetts

198
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,400
He says he felt secure in circuit cities claims of in penitrability and security

199
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
So what happened was the

200
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,560
ATF the Bureau of Alcohol tobacco and fire arms rated his home as part of an investigation

201
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,960
It's the sale of an air rifle equipped with a silencer

202
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,000
So of course you guys probably a terrorist right got a silent drawn at the air raffle

203
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
so they took his computer and

204
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
and

205
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,400
They were unable to crack the PC security features

206
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,840
So they sent it to the FBI cryptologic

207
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,520
you know cryptologic cryptologic and electronic analysis unit better known as the CEA

208
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,280
There they were able to access Crooker's files by making a mirror image of the hard drive among the files

209
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,560
They found a video showing Crooker and his girlfriend having sex his medical records family photographs and correspondent

210
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,160
Between Crooker and his attorneys. They also found internet history files that showed Crooker's fondness for pornographic websites

211
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Man, I hope they never get a hold of my PC

212
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,440
He says he had internet explorer set to delete his internet history

213
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,120
Every five days any day beyond those parameters is supposed to be permanently deleted

214
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,360
So basically what the guy is saying is you know all this

215
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:55,840
You know you're safe and it's all packed away and it's encrypted and no one can get at it that turns out that at least in the versions of software that he had was horseshit

216
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,080
And I think he has a case. I really do I mean that's we should all be very worried about that

217
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:09,040
I totally use or in the past I have to say I got tired of it because usually it fucked up my hard drive, but I've used an encryption for

218
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,160
Not really personal sensitive documents, but

219
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
And I do delete some internet cookies

220
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,360
Just so that you know someone might not like be surfing along and seeing that it's already automatically registered and logged in

221
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
anyway

222
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,160
Speaking of wanking and such yo Adam this week on house of tone. We're going acoustic

223
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,720
At least mostly acoustic this track you got to check this out this track was sent to me by fill widows

224
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,680
of the folk cast I've got to be very careful how I pronounce that the folk cast of fullcast.co.uk

225
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:53,280
Which was described as the UK's first in premier folk music podcast covering the worlds of folk folk rock singer songwriter and roots based music

226
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:59,600
Sounds pretty cool. Well fill apparently wants to focus all up because he sent me a track called Fisherman's Priest

227
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,120
Which is also the theme song for the folk cast and I guess the best way for me to actually describe this tune is it's kind of like a cross

228
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
between river dance and

229
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,560
Frankie goes to Hollywood's

230
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,960
Hit single two tribes and I know what you're saying you're like what the fuck are you talking about

231
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,760
But trust me when I say I mean it in the best possible way

232
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:28,640
So Adam smoke him if you got him lay back and get ready for a nice hard fulking because here comes

233
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Fisherman's Priest

234
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:36,560
Here comes the Frankie goes to Hollywood part

235
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
I

236
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,720
Let's sure isn't your grandfather's folk music I can tell you that much

237
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,960
The song Fisherman's Priest is all the work of folk cast co-host Ken Nichol who

238
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,920
Phil says makes a living out of spanking his various planks and apparently he has time to play the guitar as well

239
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,880
So very very cool and if you listen if you really listen to it you can really hear that

240
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,640
All those guitars were double tracked manually and I mean manually

241
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,640
Meaning that Ken laid the guitar part down on one track and then went back and replayed it

242
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:50,720
Note for note on another track and may have double and triple tracked it as opposed to some sort of artificial or digital manipulation

243
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,480
And trust me when I say that I'm an expert at digital manipulation

244
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:01,040
So if you're a guitar player, it doesn't matter if your style is metal blues jazz or you play some really

245
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:07,920
Fulking hot kick-ass acoustic send your guitar solo track to house of tone at gmail.com

246
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,160
That's house of tone all one word at gmail.com

247
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,040
And Adam thank you my brother for keeping the guitar solo in the spotlight because I can think of no

248
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:24,000
But her place to keep wanking a life then right here under your nose at the daily source code

249
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,200
So Adam I'll catch you later. Bye. Well folk me

250
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,400
Mark Yoshimoida and Kofky also keeping guitar wanking alive

251
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
What's wrong with your voice dude?

252
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,000
No, you can't spit you don't have to swallow

253
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,080
I pops up at the most opportune moments

254
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,800
Particularly when it comes to wanking

255
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,320
He sent a picture oh

256
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,280
Man, this is so wrong Roger and please don't use my name

257
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,840
I shop at Anderton's music and gillford. That's where I get all my cables and my compressors

258
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:36,320
That's where I got the TLA from the the 50 52 valve processor. Dude. It's so nasty. I can't

259
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,800
I can't you know, I'd have to Photoshop this thing in order to even

260
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Make it put it up somewhere publicly

261
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,960
Well good to hear from you Roger and I appreciate you getting into the spirit spirit of things, but

262
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
The whole idea of a splash and dash

263
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,520
Too much for me my friend. Yo Adam not jersey taught this time, but jersey Peter

264
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,480
Here's a long time listener double digits. I think from the time right after you move from Belgium to the cottage in the UK

265
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,880
Glad to hear you and Patricia doing so well and I agree with so many other listeners

266
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,560
Patricia's so great on the show. Can't you get her on more somehow?

267
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Yeah, I'd really like to

268
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,880
But she's too busy bleeding all over the place. She's got no time for us

269
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,320
Maybe tomorrow or maybe maybe Friday now tomorrow probably Friday is cleaning day

270
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,040
Yes, I'd like listeners. I'll catch you tomorrow for sure with without the lady Patricia

271
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,200
There's some parallels in our lives. I'm a Dutch guy living in Jersey and sure thing almost a joysy boy

272
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,920
The Frankie Valley show you went to in San Francisco. It made me look them up and buy some songs on iTunes

273
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,560
So much fun to be reminded of that music who know Frankie Valley was behind all those familiar songs

274
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,120
And thanks for the source code the other media that would include old-style radio broadcasts and cable TV

275
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,120
I've pretty much fallen by the wayside for me as they've become so irrelevant

276
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,920
But the Charlie has become embedded into my day

277
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,760
Perhaps the show also reminds me of the 80s when I grew up in Holland hearing you on the Dutch countdown and

278
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,600
Good evening on ankle. Great memories. So thanks for sticking around

279
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,600
You can check me out on indigored.com if you're interested check out the book I'm working on while raising my kids

280
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,760
Thanks again got speed at him. No, I thank you. I know past this on to the lady Patricia, so

281
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,160
Yeah

282
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:35,040
It'd be nice to get her on. Hey, um, you know Natalie Del Conte does a video show for us a couple times a week

283
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,040
called textra.txtra.com and

284
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,960
Every night before she tapes, she sends me the stories and they're like a show rundown because

285
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,960
I don't know why they put me up as executive producer. So I figured I'd look busy and

286
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,760
I'm not gonna read the whole story to you, but I do want to this is something you will definitely want to check out this this piece of news

287
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,960
I'm sure there must be a link somewhere online about this, but it's a very interesting the French

288
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:12,640
Constitutional council approved a law this week that makes it makes it illegal to film or broadcast acts of violence online or on TV if you are not

289
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
a professional journalist

290
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Well, it's not interesting

291
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,680
That wouldn't go over too well in the states my frog friends

292
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,000
Oh man, I think you're asking for trouble with this one. That's like called what do we call that sense or ship exactly

293
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,960
I wonder if that's gonna be ratified through the European Union or it maybe you don't need any ratification

294
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
I guess you can do whatever you want, but

295
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,640
Holy moly professional journalists means your card carrying I guess

296
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,640
I don't know. I really don't know if that's a good idea

297
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
I think we're gonna miss out on a couple things there

298
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,840
Let me see some longer comments. I'm just gonna play some bits from

299
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,040
Item it's edros from pots with here. I've not listened to the SE for a couple of months

300
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:08,320
Do some health reasons, so also might need a bit of help knowing what's been going on since they're beginning of January

301
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,440
I have a bit of somebody to do a Trinity and you've got a nice knocking at hundreds and stuff, but just a few pointers as to

302
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,360
To what's been going on in your life might be nice. All right. We'll have to ask the govers to do another FAQ

303
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,600
So people, you know, I should make that a promo

304
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,600
If you stop listening for the past couple months, here's what you missed

305
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,480
But why? Anyway, um, did catch a few last week heard you talking about Wi-Fi sharing

306
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,520
Don't know if you know about a company called fawn that's fuckstraught Oscar

307
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
And no member

308
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
Nutsack you could say

309
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Or we

310
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Anyway, F-O-N.com

311
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:58,160
They have a Wi-Fi sharing community which sounds really fun. Yeah, you know this is this is about

312
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,240
About naming your Wi-Fi access point with your email address. You know there's so many dirt that you know sometimes

313
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,880
I wonder why if I seem to be so host there seems to be so many different things and competing

314
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
ways of doing things and

315
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
And the phone thing F-O-N

316
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,680
Yeah, I've heard about it, but you know that that the launch of that was kind of unfortunate

317
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,320
Because as I recall it

318
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,440
Apparently a lot of bloggers who were very enthusiastic about the service

319
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,360
Were incentivized somehow on the back end and that you know that stirred up a shitstorm and then of course

320
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,040
No one really focused on on the building of the community. I should check that out

321
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,640
There probably is something there, but I guess I have to get a new router or router

322
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
I don't know if I'm into that

323
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,600
The first thing I'm going that was cool. That was really quiet wasn't it the first thing or the next step in the free

324
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,320
Trinity

325
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
Promotion is

326
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,280
Is to get this this tablet up and running so we have the technology ready to send her on her way

327
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,120
Now you remember listening to Doug Pilgrim and his son who were totally into doing a part of this

328
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,600
And as we're you know rethinking the the drive the driver situation how we get people

329
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,800
Cued up, you know, I want to make sure the technology is right so I have this N800 which Nokia sent over

330
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,280
Luke from Nokia who happens to be a Dutch guy by the way

331
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,280
It's funny. We send emails back and forth. Yeah, I was like my BFF

332
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,600
You know we're emailing and and and testing voice stuff and it's kind of freaky

333
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Anyway

334
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,400
There's the the sensitivity has a name Trinity is my

335
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,160
My baby poo colored Mercedes

336
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,560
Stationwagger from 1984 the runs on biodiesel better known as vegetable oil

337
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:58,800
So we got a name this tablet which actually is going to sit now I've started the configuration because I had to make a couple of user accounts

338
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,920
So first you have to get root and then you have to install the SSH server so that the you know a few

339
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,600
Engineers and

340
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,680
Technologists who want to develop this have raised their hands, you know, I'm gonna let them come in and

341
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:20,000
Basically violate anything they want on the Nokia and 800 because she'll have reports wide open for these developers wide open ports

342
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,520
I so of course

343
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,800
Yeah, this is a real thing, you know, it's it's alive. There's there's men inside this thing so I want to give her a name

344
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,920
And people are sending in some pretty interesting

345
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,040
Suggestions um the comics are blah, but blogger

346
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,040
Suggested we use the name Tariah, which is a very common name in Finland, which I think is a pretty good idea

347
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Although then cleatus the Wayne sends in

348
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,000
How about to rock sand and he give me some lyrics here rock sand you don't have to put on the red light

349
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,320
Those days are over just need to open your ports for the geeks at night

350
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,840
I can hear Jeff Smith jingle happening already don't do yet Jeff because I don't know what the I don't know what the name is

351
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,920
Oh, yeah, so here's here's an email from Luke saying yeah, yeah, Tariah is a that's a pretty common female name in Finland

352
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,120
The president of Finland her name is indeed Tariah Hallonen

353
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,040
Hallonen yeah, and there's lots of Tariahs in his life, so

354
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Okay, so Tariah might be a good one

355
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,080
We have some other comments about the N800 hi Adam this is Brandon in Tucson

356
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,280
Had an idea for the name of your N800

357
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
I know you went with Angelina

358
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,040
She is quite the prince of the darkness, but I think a better name might be Natalie Portman

359
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Bet just a thought

360
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,960
It's yeah

361
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,080
Natalie Portman. I like that. Natalie. Ah, Natalie open your apartment

362
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,520
So when else said the how about

363
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,240
Sharon as in Sharon Stone because she flashed her ports on film and

364
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,200
For me that immediately is associated with Sharon Osborn, so it just doesn't really work, you know

365
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Yes, I think this is for Adam Curtis

366
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
This is his neighbor

367
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,320
Sharon Osborn. Yes, it's the Sharon Osborn the one you to do was not sexy

368
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,960
Well, I'm your neighbor now and you know

369
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:22,240
Your apples are growing too heavy and fast and they're dropping all over our backyard and you have to clean it up

370
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
Okay, so

371
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Tonight Oats Up by

372
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,880
That was a fantastic Sharon Osborn in personation. I have to say I was fooled from from the second it came in

373
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,920
Your suggestions for the N800's name

374
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,360
This lovely female device who will be opening her ports

375
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,120
Very wide for developers to come in and violate her internally. We'd love to hear your suggestions

376
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,760
Also talk to me yesterday about voice over IP

377
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,000
I got a lot of comments about that as I expected this one is kind of funny though

378
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,680
Let's listen to the setup and then I'll interrupt the call

379
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,600
Yeah, and it's false from my critical in Washington. I do IT support

380
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,760
Management my company does that

381
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,320
For various companies on the west coast and around the world anyway

382
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,720
Your voice discussion come my eye my ear as you said

383
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,320
We just did a voice install. We didn't actually do a real source of voice install

384
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
So come to help with IT solutions and

385
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,920
Okay, so so I'm gonna stop him here for a second. So first of all

386
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,520
This is cool. You know his company does voice over IP installations and he just did an installation

387
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,960
It's he's not it's not really pitching me on anything but he's he's interested in the conversation

388
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,080
He knows a lot about it

389
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:44,800
But here's what kills me as you listen to this comment you'll it starts to become completely unintelligible because I presume

390
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
He's calling on voice listen to this

391
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
See it's phasing in and out

392
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,280
I mean that'll that'll kill me if I if I have to listen to conference calls that way that would suck

393
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
Oh

394
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,160
And yeah a lot of people said that it's true

395
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:15,280
You know all these void providers. So you know basically the gizmo project is pretty much just a front end for the sip protocol

396
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,240
And yeah, they tie into a PBX which is I think an asterix

397
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,360
That's an open source PBX and you know someone there's buying minutes and switching stuff through so

398
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,480
You know the systems are pretty much in place, but it's stuff like that you know when the quality really degrade so

399
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:36,320
severely it becomes and the only thing you can say is you know you get what you pay for you know, which is kind of true

400
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,000
Now I haven't had a really bad experience yet

401
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,280
We're using using the gizmo project, but caller ID it just doesn't work

402
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,720
You know, it's because people are min from eight million different

403
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:57,360
Minutes providers and god knows what the connections are and the first thing to get dropped along the line of stuff in the protocol is the caller ID and it really really sucks

404
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:07,680
And I tell you until we get that stuff moved along it's just going to be second tier service. I mean people get used to that kind of stuff not just

405
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
You know voice mail sure that's important

406
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,880
But we need these other services and they have to work properly

407
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,920
You know the government's always focusing on you have to have emergency services like you know nine one one

408
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,400
Yeah fantastic give me fucking caller ID okay

409
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
I

410
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Something else I was going to say about that

411
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,480
I can't remember what was talking about was talking about the voice over IP

412
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,280
The crap I can't remember now I may be able to come back to me during this

413
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
I

414
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
What

415
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,240
That is the best part

416
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,120
No

417
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,520
That is the best part

418
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,080
No, I want to listen to it okay

419
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Oh

420
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Love that

421
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,320
Okay, I remember what I was going to talk about it was about the cloud there's this provider in in

422
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:51,760
Certainly in Europe. I don't know if they're in the states as well, but in the UK and they have good coverage in London

423
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,800
And um, I think it's called the cloud dot net. That's how you get to it

424
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,520
And you can sign they actually have a special promotion for the Nokia and 800 tablet

425
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:07,440
Where you sign up to the service for nine pounds 95 cents per month plant pens per month, which I already did and

426
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,880
You you are automatically authenticated on any one of their hotspots and they have hotspots and gulfed as well

427
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,640
But they don't do it through a username password. They do it at the MAC address level

428
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,600
So the actual ethernet address of the of the Wi-Fi

429
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,000
Chip that's in the tablet or I presume in any other Wi-Fi enabled device. It'll it'll work the same way

430
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,000
So when you're in the proximity it'll automatically connect it'll automatically you know do whatever it has to do

431
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,640
For instance, it could reconnect my my Gizmo project client so that you know a

432
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,920
Potentially phone calls could come in but certainly some stuff could update like my new

433
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:52,720
My podcast aggregator. You know, it's a lot of that dream that we've been having of some kind of device that just sits in your pocket is looking all over the place for a network

434
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,560
And this one does it looks for open networks

435
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,400
It looks and I was looking for the cloud as well

436
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,960
Which of course will take preference it'll automatically log in and then it'll start to download stuff

437
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,280
You know, we're getting very close to that dream player and I got to tell you I got to tell you

438
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,760
I should be charging Nokia some freaking money for this shit. I'm way too enthusiastic about it

439
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Oh

440
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,440
crap

441
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,880
I'm sorry. That was the wrong one. Well, now I just gave it away. Didn't I?

442
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
March 22nd is

443
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,000
Marked as bum rush the charts day now you've probably seen

444
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,560
The bum rush the charts logo on a couple of show sites

445
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,640
Certainly a number of pod show podcasts, but also podcasts outside of the pod show network or supporting this the idea is

446
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
on March 22nd to all

447
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:43,520
On mass and I'm going to ask you listeners on March 22nd as well obviously to go and spend 99 cents

448
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,120
to buy one song one track at

449
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,480
On iTunes

450
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
Because we believe that we can actually

451
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,600
Get this song to move up the charts and show that there is quite a bit of power in independent media

452
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
predominantly in podcasting

453
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
And the audiences that we

454
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
Have that are surround us essentially

455
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,880
And I love the idea. I think it's a very pirate kind of thing to do

456
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
It's not an official pod show promotion

457
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,480
But a lot of pod show podcasts as our participating in and obviously I hope the audiences will do the same

458
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,560
You know it's 99 cents to help out in an experiment of course of course

459
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,840
You know when you choose a band and the band that was chosen was black lab

460
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,680
The reason they were chosen is because they were on a major label and were dropped

461
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,680
So we you know that's kind of like a double whammy to say hey, you know there is audience out there

462
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,240
And they are motivated and they do care and obviously if you don't you don't give a shit about the song and don't buy it

463
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,440
If you hate the band don't buy it, please only if you want to and you want to help out

464
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,040
And it being the podosphere the podcast community and the blogosphere

465
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,000
Of course there's people saying well, he's that really that band chose to random

466
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,800
Like yeah, like we're trying to hype a band and this is some kind of hidden fucking promotion

467
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
That's so a fucking offensive

468
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,960
So of course, you know even though we didn't involve them officially or they're not involved officially as far as I know

469
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,560
Black lab Paul Durham

470
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,120
I has something to say about the bum rush the charts

471
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:16,880
Operation bum rush the charts and I think he's got a really good idea how we can just keep this on the straight and narrow and be focused and do what we set out to do

472
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:24,000
Hey, this is Paul Durham for the band black lab a lot of you may have heard about bum rush the charts a campaign by podcasters

473
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,760
And listeners to take over the iTunes charts by buying our song mine again on March 22

474
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,560
It's funny that a lot of people think that this is some kind of

475
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,760
Marketing gimmick on our part and I just wanted to take a moment to reassure everyone that

476
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
We're not that smart

477
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,400
In fact, we had nothing to do with planning of it

478
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,400
But now things are going crazy

479
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:58,320
So anyway, we just wanted to say that we are totally behind this effort to demonstrate the power of independent art and media

480
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,520
And we hope everyone will focus on the purpose of BRTC

481
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:07,360
Which is to make a statement about the power pod casting and to raise some money for a scholarship program

482
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,840
So on March 22 in addition to the iTunes affiliate money that is already been set up

483
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,480
We're going to be donating 50% of our earnings from the song to the scholarship fund as well

484
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:24,240
So thanks everybody and bum rush the charts. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. All right, so there you go. Thank you very much Paul
