Welcome back to Business Insight, where tonight we have special guest Adam Curry,

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,960
the pod father and co-founder of Pod Chef.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,560
Now, Adam, before you get off to the DSC 686,

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,720
we want to know about the special programs you have for employee retention.

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,840
Now, how have you traditionally handled employee retention?

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,000
I've worked pretty hard for the past couple of decades, so most of that I take care of myself.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,280
Then you say take care of yourself, what exactly do you mean?

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,280
What kind of programs or offers do you make to the employee?

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,680
Karen T. Blowjob time. I'm telling you.

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,760
Do you mean let's just leave that one alone for right now.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,720
Here is the DSC 686.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,400
Here is the DSC 786.

22
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,320
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass,

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,000
turn in the next generation rainy content in my ears.

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,360
I like to think I'm shining, to the future.

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:04,080
There are interesting things across his chest, prepared to lay him down to his race.

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:11,520
He said, I see my race is running, when I thought it had just begun.

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,280
But no, no, no, I think it's plain to see.

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
There's been a day in the mercury.

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,800
I hear a whisper, the voice of doom.

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
I hear the repair is in the room.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,240
Night now, one time, come to the side.

32
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,680
Hey, hey, you know what I mean?

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,960
I think it's time to fire the night.

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:56,640
From a very young day, she hears a call, something back up and beyond the walls.

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
She stays the course on quiet streams.

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,480
But when she dreams her shy girl dreams.

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,000
She's alone on the high seas out on the day.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,840
Begging her, please, I have no confidence, I have no choice.

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,760
What do I do with my wild heart?

40
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:27,040
Young down, slant by, one of the stars are starting to cry.

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,720
Hey, hey, you know what I mean?

42
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,040
I think it's time to fire the night.

43
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,480
From a very young day, she hears a call, something back up and beyond the walls.

44
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,840
Hey, hey, you know what I mean?

45
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,960
I think it's time to fire the night.

46
00:03:50,960 --> 00:04:12,400
We march and start, we walk the line travelling through this life unkind,

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
Wrapped in chains to be bound

48
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,000
Until they put us in the cold cold ground

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
The leash just hands across its chest

50
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,440
Repair to lay him to his wrist

51
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,880
He said I see the time has come

52
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,280
My wild heart beats with the thunder of a drum

53
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,120
Nothing at all, it's right now

54
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,880
Our nature just starting to run

55
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,480
Hey, hey, hey, you know why

56
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,720
I think it's time to fire it all

57
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,760
Time for me come to so

58
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,160
It's time to strain it all

59
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
Hey, hey, you know why

60
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
It's time to try it all

61
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,240
Oh yeah, now that's what I'm talking about when you want to kick off the food bar just right

62
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Some food no vocals

63
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Have he asked us all

64
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,960
And you got my tip

65
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,400
Stone, that coyote is

66
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
Fire it up from the pot safe music network

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,080
On daddy's George code episode number six eighty six the Palomgrom at the show

68
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,000
Are you doing I'm back at the curry manner

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm the affluent subversory known as gilford on the west side of Gtown

70
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Yes

71
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,680
Good to be back arrived last night from Finland

72
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,080
Man

73
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,480
What an interesting place to be and what a great

74
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,480
It was just a great set of meetings we had up there with with the folks from Nokia

75
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,240
Nokia, I should say all right. I got so much to learn never been to Finland

76
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Big country not a lot of people

77
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,560
I

78
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Did one spectacular thing that I've been wanting to do for

79
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,640
Let me see I think this was it must have been 30 years ago

80
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,120
And I can't remember the circumstances although what's with my parents and I remember it was

81
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,720
It had to do with flying somewhere maybe it wasn't with maybe it was 20 it was long time ago

82
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
I remembered I had once had reindeer

83
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
And I had it again and I got to tell you

84
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,000
Man, that is that is just so nice and when it's served to you and this great restaurant we went to

85
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
They tell you exactly

86
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:42,000
What town the reindeer was from and what farm the reindeer was from and like that sounds kind of weird. Yeah, but you know, there's if we don't

87
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,840
Where they call it call or

88
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,520
Harvest the reindeer the entire country would be filled with reindeer so I guess it's in necessity

89
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,200
Oh, man

90
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,680
Give me all the power I need for a football Friday

91
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,160
Hey, Adam is just sitting in the hands of USA again following up. I just left you a message

92
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
But it sucked in a lot of words

93
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,520
Yeah, because my other things I forgot to say fuck you so fuck you. Okay. Thank you

94
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:13,080
And I had recently told you that I wasn't going to listen anymore. I had a dial out because of the political content

95
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Uh-huh

96
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
The TSA stuff and what happened while I I'm still not digging that I couldn't stay away

97
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,520
Find myself looking for the DSC and if I could drive or something then I I will

98
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,520
Probably continue to fast forward through some parts and your main line in my friend. You can't help yourself

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,760
And I think to be all right with that so this I was calling about boil

100
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,640
The comment that you made that you had claimed that oil would hit $100 a bell

101
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,440
I do remember you saying that but it was late late summer early fall

102
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,600
2006 so you were a little bit ahead of the time

103
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,240
It wouldn't have hit that mark by the end of 2006, but obviously you're right now and

104
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,840
Fuck you all right, all right, so it was I

105
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,800
Telling you the older I get the more I witnessed this problem you've been doing this stuff for like three three years now

106
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,760
No wait, it's we're coming up on three and a half years we've been doing shows

107
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Oh my goodness. Yeah, yeah, well just for you my friend. I've got something about the clear program

108
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,440
I'm very good morning

109
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
This is Michael calling from San Francisco

110
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
I actually kind of live all over the west coast

111
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,360
I've been listening to the FC for a couple years and I just had to comment about the clear program

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,160
I actually got several offers by email from Freakland's Liner and Freakland hotel programs offering me a

113
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,760
Complementary membership to have the TSA inspect my ass

114
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,240
I slide three four days a week

115
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:48,400
I absolutely see the IDC of the TSA action every day every week and the whole thing is absolutely just a joke

116
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,800
I another time I told him I will tell you about an interesting gift stop

117
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,320
I'll experience I had with the eight on the three power craze

118
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,360
TSA and all right at the LA expert

119
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Anyway folder and

120
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Fuck you. No, thank you

121
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,280
Yeah, I got an email from Ola

122
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,240
Ola who Christian Valle who sends me a little tidbits now and this from the New York Times

123
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
There was a test that was done by undercover

124
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,040
Lucy

125
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,920
It's here inquiry airport security not tied enough

126
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,160
You'd like this

127
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:30,240
So some tests were done let me just find out who did this over the past year investigators have been testing airport security checkpoints for vulnerabilities and have found some disturbing ones

128
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Check this out

129
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
As a mock terrorist sell

130
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,240
Investigators found instructions for building devices that could quote

131
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,280
Call severe damage to an airplane and threaten the safety of passengers. They found this on the web

132
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,720
bought the parts online for less than $150

133
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,080
Tested the devices in government labs and then succeeded in smuggling all the parts needed to make

134
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Right through the checkpoints

135
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,440
Yeah, of course

136
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,280
I know and everywhere I go people are talking about this of course I've been traveling a lot

137
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,920
So it is a topic of conversation

138
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,760
It was like yeah, of course and again

139
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,560
I just want to point out we're doing this in the UK okay, and not just in the UK

140
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,400
We're doing it in

141
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,840
Finland had the same the same restriction slash qualifications nor to get on the airplane and

142
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,720
You know

143
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,360
Where did we do it at the terrorist attacks take place in the UK again? Was it the airport or was it that?

144
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,640
That's right it was tubes and buses funny. I don't see any any

145
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,440
Any type of security there well if you thought the TSA was nuts

146
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,000
Trying to try to scare us a terrorizing us literally about you know

147
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,720
Why don't we just all fly naked wouldn't that be better it wouldn't just be better

148
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,160
It was no bags no clothing you know you don't have to take a shoes off. It was really easy

149
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,040
Maybe we'll actually get together you know and it'll be fun because we'll all be

150
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,480
Naked we'll all be you know all be hanging out there literally and

151
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,000
And we'll all kind of be in the same boat together and maybe it actually will be a very humanizing experience

152
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,480
Maybe maybe maybe then again maybe fucking not you could always of course just go to the land of the mouse and get the same treatment

153
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,720
Hey Adam that's Howard Greestine and hello very source code listeners

154
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,520
Why are you talking today on the November 12th?

155
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,280
I don't know the the number of the source condition about the new

156
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,800
system that allows you to glide through the airport by just showing your biometric spending over letting the government

157
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Take a quick peek and

158
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
You know getting you through in the fast lane

159
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,200
You know

160
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,640
One thing you should be aware of I believe that system was created by Stephen Grill who's I believe someone of a libertarian

161
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,400
So you know, it's probably more to it than

162
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,120
What you see. I don't think it's just a home and security monitor anything. Yeah, of course the

163
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:54,320
Oh, stop stop of course atomic energy wasn't necessarily a nuclear energy wasn't necessarily

164
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
Discovered to create bombs

165
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,720
You know

166
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,040
You understand what I'm saying right gunpowder was wasn't gunpowder invented for fireworks first or was it dynamite?

167
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,480
I don't know the bring your attention

168
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,200
This is not the only place that you're getting fingerprinted and checked out

169
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,800
I just took the family to do the world and guess what you have to give them a fingerprint in order to get into the park

170
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:21,280
It's at least your card to use you don't you know give your past to somebody else if you haven't used all the days

171
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,520
Of course, you know when you enter the park you don't say which finger you need to give them

172
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,840
So

173
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,880
That's

174
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,800
Just out there yeah, and yeah, I really wasn't thrilled about it. So fuck you Disney

175
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,080
Yes, I'm guys. Yeah, right on man. Thank you. Okay, so

176
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,960
Well, that puts the land of the mouse high in my boycott list and we're planning on going to Disneyland and

177
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,760
Europe to Paris. I wonder if you have to use your your finger there to identify yourself

178
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,360
Wait a minute. Let me just identify myself to you right now with this finger. There you go

179
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,480
It's a four bar Friday. What means we need a mash-up

180
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
To get us into the weekend

181
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,840
I'm just a little

182
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
You

183
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,680
Yeah

184
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

185
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Who are you being alone?

186
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

187
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

188
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

189
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

190
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

191
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

192
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

193
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

194
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

195
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

196
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

197
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

198
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

199
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

200
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

201
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,960
I'm going to get you out of the shop

202
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,940
I'm going to get you out of the shop

203
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:58,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

204
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:28,940
oh oh oh oh

205
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:58,940
oh oh oh oh

206
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:28,940
oh but oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh my oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I oh yeah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh徐 oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh aye oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

207
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:36,300
Podcast ready is not open source, but it's definitely a cross-platform iTunes replacement that is opening up some gates.

208
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:47,780
Not only does it work on iPod, Zoom, Iriver, and just about any other MP3 player, but it's shipping on 35 million Kobe and Sandisk devices.

209
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:57,660
Now, every copy of the software comes pre-subscribed to 10 sample shows, and I just wanted to let you know that we added your show no agenda to that subscription list.

210
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:05,060
So, start watching your download stats, see what percentage starts to show up is coming from podcast Reddy's My Potter.

211
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,960
The floodgates are about to smash open.

212
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:14,260
Love the new show, folder, and let me tell you that my pill is so beyond red that it's white hot, maybe.

213
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,260
We'll have to swap conspiracies one of these days. One word, eugenics.

214
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,960
Oh, and in an odd to battle star galactica, frac you Adam.

215
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,260
You genics, huh? I'll have to Wikipedia that.

216
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:35,160
Yeah, as I was listening to that, I'm like, oh, yeah, no agenda. I got to do that tonight with John C. DeVorac, and I have a business dinner, which starts at typical British time.

217
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:42,460
830 this evening. I'm going to be so hungry by the time we go on get to eat crap, so I don't have to figure out how to do that.

218
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,560
Maybe we'll have to do a Saturday recording. I don't know if we can do that with the DeVorac. I'll check, man. That sounds pretty cool.

219
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,860
It's tough, though, with these types of things, you know, where you have to make decisions about what you're going to put into a top level.

220
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:01,960
Discovery directory, and I really do like the podcast ready idea. I've always thought that was good to put stuff on to memory cards.

221
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:10,460
I wonder, are people now discovering this, and I will take a look at the, I will take a look at the stats and see, and we're doing okay, actually.

222
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:19,760
We're doing about, I don't know, about 150,000, yeah, like 150,000 now. I think that, that have gotten the show.

223
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:32,460
So it's, it's getting there. It's getting there. Basically, it's not, you know, it's no agenda, it's no jingles, no talent, no music, and we don't really care if those ratings are not.

224
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:39,560
It's just to, to mid-laged cranky white guys talking about some shit, but it's hard.

225
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:48,260
In fact, here's something that was interesting, this comment came in today, which of course we've known about for a while, but people are just discovering this as well.

226
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:58,260
Hey, Adam Curry, this is Julio from New York here. I just want to let you know, I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but a table has some pot show related content on it's a table cast.

227
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:12,960
And I was just wondering if you're going to be adding any time soon, the, you know, that cop show you have texture, banging with butt lyr and some other of your online video content to have on your, in that work,

228
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:20,460
especially since this writer's track is going on, and TV shows are probably going to go on hiatus, we get to have some stuff to watch on my, on my table.

229
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:29,460
Anyway, a calculator and yeah, you know, are you kidding me? I'd love to have port city PD on the table cast.

230
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:38,460
Now, unfortunately, the table, of course, is the boss of their stuff. So they determine what is appropriate for what they deem to be appropriate for their audience.

231
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:48,960
In fact, we even have to put ratings on all of the shows. And we have to, you know, it's a pretty big process because original files have to be encoded in the special and peg two format, then they have to go to some special server.

232
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:57,960
So there's a lot of work involved in this. And of course, we wanted to, well, I'd like to have all of our, all of our video shows and some audio shows in fact show up on the, on the TV cast.

233
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:07,960
But it's just a start of the relationship, you know, we originally proposed five channels and now we have one. And so we're working on it. But yeah, we'll text or make it on. I hope so.

234
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,960
I don't see where that would be. Well, sometimes native, they'll content can be kind of arrated.

235
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:21,960
But port city PD was declined, which is a bomber, especially because you pointed out so well, you know, with the writer's strike over.

236
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Maybe their tumult change a little bit because, honestly, compared to a lot of things you can get on television and cable, I think port city PD is rather tame.

237
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Let me see. Oh, yeah, it was one of the things I was going to say about to know a gen that just skipping back for a second.

238
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:47,960
I was Stefanos sent me a Hulu beta login, which I appreciate very much. John Devorkin, I've been talking about this Hulu thing, which is NBC's online video offering.

239
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Yeah, all these reviews that were running around that were saying was a cool and awesome. Well, I don't really understand what they're talking about.

240
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,960
It's a site and it has a nice interface to view their TV shows. And that's it.

241
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:15,960
If you like the shows, yeah, then I guess it's cool, but please, you know, it's not like there's anything groundbreaking going on here except for the fact that they're ripping writers off.

242
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,960
And not paying them for that.

243
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:34,960
He forever changed the face of popular music, one man, one voice, a lifetime of stories, somewhere between the famous sorrow and the real king of rock and roll.

244
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,960
People tell me I'm a natural, but I'm not those who are what that means. I work hard on my music, but that doesn't mean I understand it.

245
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:48,960
I love it like I love a painting or a beautiful woman, but I don't usually get to talk about it too much.

246
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,960
And I guess you could say the same about my life.

247
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,960
But the very first time you are peek behind the curtain at the real Elvis Presley.

248
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Some people would have to believe that the night I was born, there was a strange lad in the sky, or three wise men came from the east.

249
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,960
It wasn't like that. There was a lot of blood and pain.

250
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
I went a little bit of guard out.

251
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,960
The Lost Elvis Diaries, coming in 2008 to headphones near you, only on Pod Show.

252
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
Yeah.

253
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,960
Speaking of coming to headphones near you, I think we got a pretty cool sponsorship on the way.

254
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
For Sony headphones, which would be hearing about across the network.

255
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Trying to log into my stats right now to see if Pod cast ready is actually putting a dent in some of the numbers on no agenda.

256
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Slow, slow. You know what we do when things are slow? We do when things are slow on a Friday.

257
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,960
We try to pick things up with young Palette.

258
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Pod crawling casting with Adam Curry.

259
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Hey Adam, who are you ready to be stumped?

260
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Because he used a new test with young Palette.

261
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Hey Adam, this is hit test number 96, and boy, do I have some great music for you?

262
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,960
So here we go with intro number one.

263
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Uh-huh.

264
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Uh-huh.

265
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Uh-huh.

266
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Uh-huh.

267
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Don't push it. Don't force it.

268
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
Just relax and let it go.

269
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Number two.

270
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Yon, my brain is fried.

271
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Uh-huh.

272
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Crap, I don't know what that is.

273
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Number three.

274
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Okay, no, that is.

275
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Uh-huh.

276
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Uh-huh.

277
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Cray.

278
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
It's a bright next door, man.

279
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
Uh-huh.

280
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Michael Cray.

281
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Uh-huh.

282
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Something cray.

283
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Right next door.

284
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
And time's up, and this is answer number one.

285
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
I'm sweating.

286
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,960
Yeah, I got this or five times.

287
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Uh-huh.

288
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,960
From 1980, Leon Heward.

289
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Leon Heward.

290
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
He's 14.

291
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Patience isn't up as I've heard you.

292
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Remember that word, huh?

293
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,960
When I'm in the mood for the...

294
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,960
One, two, three, four, four.

295
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Don't force it.

296
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Just relax and let it go.

297
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
It's no fun.

298
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Leon Heward is answer number one.

299
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
What the hell is this?

300
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
This is answer number two.

301
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
I'll bet you don't give it up.

302
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
From in 1993.

303
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960
It's the first time that you're saying that.

304
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,960
All that.

305
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,960
This is give it up in the headlines.

306
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:54,880
And this is Anton No. 3, the Robert Craven and right next door.

307
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:05,760
I can hear the couple fighting right next door, and I rang we were, something we didn't want.

308
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:16,440
She was right next door and I'm so just wrong, we're swayed up, in the silence I can't hear her breaking heart.

309
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:26,440
Anton No. 3, the Robert Craven from 1987, and that concludes here test number 96.

310
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,440
So I don't know how did you do?

311
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,440
I would like to. I would like to do this.

312
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,440
So thank you for playing, and next week I'll be back for hit test number 97.

313
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,440
So until then, take care and bye-bye.

314
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:52,440
And of course, Jan has links to all of the songs.

315
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,440
I tunes links that is all of the songs played in the hit test at hittest.podshow.com.

316
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,440
Hey, just looking to see if there's any jump in the numbers here.

317
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,440
And that's about the same.

318
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,440
About the same as it's been.

319
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,440
All right, we'll keep our eye on it. If we just got at it, it could be very interesting.

320
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,440
See what happens there. Jan, thank you so much, man. Good.

321
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,440
I really got like one and three quarter stars this time on a three because I didn't have all the names right,

322
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
nor all the titles right, but I'm trying.

323
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
It is football Friday.

324
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Daily source code episode number 686.

325
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,440
Checking in from the Garden State, my friends.

326
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,440
I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

327
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Your honor, please don't bang that gavel.

328
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,440
You can try this cowbell out.

329
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Let's all give a nod.

330
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,440
To the hardest work in the lawyer, he's jersey tied and bad yet.

331
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,440
He's jersey tied and bad yet.

332
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
You're on it.

333
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
What do you say?

334
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,440
You might even get wet in this case.

335
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
You're jersey.

336
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
Yo, how's it going?

337
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm a jersey tied.

338
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,440
The official musicologist of the Chacha.

339
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Hey, my main man, my brother from another mother, jersey Joe,

340
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,440
sent me an email this week indicating that he was going in for some surgery.

341
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,440
And we're all really really thinking about him this week.

342
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,440
And before he went in for surgery, he's an email about a guy named Jake Leer

343
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,440
that just got added to the positive music network.

344
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,440
And Jake is absolutely fantastic.

345
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,440
And jersey Joe found another one that just absolutely rocks.

346
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
Jake is out in New York, New York.

347
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
He has got the soul of Bob Dylan.

348
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Make someone with the soul of Steve Ray Vaughan.

349
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,440
This is an incredible, incredible blue song.

350
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
I think you're really going to enjoy.

351
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,440
And I know that somewhere out there jersey Joe is listening to it.

352
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
And really enjoying it too.

353
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
Hey, check this out.

354
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,440
There's a Jake Leer on your food bar Friday.

355
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,440

Been a man standing we're the girl in his hand

399
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:07,440
Been a man standing we're the girl in his hand

400
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:17,440
Sometimes the same thing so hard on the same

401
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:53,440
All in right I think six we ain't mutison

402
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Oh yeah the music college is called to write once again

403
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,440
You kinda gotta be into this stuff but if you do a man you love it

404
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:29,440
Jake Leer leave this town from the pot safe music network and a special warm shout out to Jersey Joe's going through a rough time right now

405
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,440
Say hi make sure that he knows that we're all thinking about him here on the cha cha

406
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,440
Last night I came home and my wife showed me with gifts man. I was so nice. She gave me a

407
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,440
She went out shopping for me. She got me some new slippers which is really nice because I've been wearing the

408
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:51,440
The boots and I've been getting kind of worn and actually they're black boots. So they rub off on the carpeting

409
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,080
It's maybe one of the reasons there she got me an awesome new coat which I'm going to try out when I go to the city later

410
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,440
Just afternoon for you know the meetings and the business dinner and she also bought me a nice and new lighter

411
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,440
Which has kind of it's a

412
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,440
Here, can you hear it? Can you hear it? Oh, here comes. Oh shit fuck

413
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Oh crap

414
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
Oh, I'm a douche bag

415
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,440
I just burned a hole

416
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
I can't believe I did that

417
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,440
I have one of those wind screens in front of the microphone and this is one of those like Bunsen burner blow torch lighters

418
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,440
But a classy looking one and I just burned a hole in my wind screen

419
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
Okay, love the presence

420
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:41,440
Well, I'm sorry. I still have got you again. I'm on a roll today, man. A lot of IDs in my and my brains. Hey question again for you

421
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,440
Can I buy virtual merchandise?

422
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,440
She spoke about the three ways you make money yesterday

423
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:55,440
Maybe if you start selling merchandise and I do some de-shoots get you know

424
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
Bross

425
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,440
Pot show gross that would even give you an excuse

426
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:08,740
To do a model shoot using gives out a bunch in and then you just you can hold our tips and you can tell Patricia that you're

427
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,740
Art directing

428
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:17,940
There we kind of fun with it. So hey, maybe and start selling pot show merchandise if you need somebody to sell it in Germany

429
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
I'm your man

430
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,940
Bye bye

431
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,940
I'm used to there

432
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,440
No, I just want I thought you were gonna wait

433
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,940
No, I'm so I was showing my my gifts that you gave me and I burned a hole

434
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,940
I'm an idiot

435
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,940
Thanks on I love my gifts

436
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,940
I won't burn down the house when I'm promised

437
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,940
Hey, you man you turn it into a savant calling in with all these awesome ideas by the way

438
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,940
I don't think though I don't have to make anything up lady Patricia be into that too

439
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,940
She thinks that'd be pretty funny selling a pot show bras

440
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,940
No, I don't see that as a big line of business

441
00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:00,940
What I do see as a big line of business and something that we've been working on for a little while is

442
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:06,940
Enabling any show on the network to create their own merchandise and an incredibly good price

443
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,940
Like let's just say real cheap cheaper that you can get it anywhere else even at

444
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,940
You know what are these places cafe press et cetera and

445
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,940
And

446
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:21,940
And setting up real simply so you could sell your own merchandise that is something that we've been looking at but it's it's really

447
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:27,940
And it's interesting a lot of people called in when I and I just kind of offhand of they said well, you know, here's the three ways to make money is we've got

448
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:33,940
Cindicating our our platform and our company so that's like our British telecom deal and then we have

449
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,940
Advertising which I'll just loosely call advertisement because it's not just

450
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,940
All spots and banners and stuff and overlays, you know, it's a host endorsements

451
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,940
Which is something codely new and then there's the seller tame and part which I really believe in

452
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,940
Just look at the success of go daddy and lots of people been calling in about this remark I made

453
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,940
Hey, yeah, I'm the state of marketing

454
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,940
Southeast Texas

455
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,940
Last time I was on your show

456
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,940
We're not calling stuff out one of the first I thought touches in September and Houston

457
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,940
Now that it's packed, I think it's the most wonderful. I thought I'd ever seen in the whole universe

458
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,940
Although I just saw the

459
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,940
Nokia I guess it's eight or N-810

460
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:25,940
Yep, and now access to own the home operating system has created an overlay for that device

461
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,940
So that you can run run the palm or F on it, which means you can run theory a bunch of

462
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,940
Palm apps on there. Nokia really

463
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:40,940
Yeah, and so I held one yesterday. I held one in Finland. I found old one in Finland

464
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:47,940
Don't tell me that that's very cool if that's true that it can run palm OS apps. That's awesome. Hey, this new device

465
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,940
It's freaking cool. I didn't get one

466
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:56,940
Uber sales Weasel Chris Jacob took the one that was given to us

467
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,940
But I do I did as I said I found it. Oh, man, this thing is it's liquidy split. It's thin. It's got a real keyboard

468
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,940
It's faster than the N-800, at least it appears a lot faster

469
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,940
The flash videos played much more smoothly very very impressed with this thing

470
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,940
And of course has GPS built in including maps. So yeah, man

471
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,940
When I get one I'll be telling y'all about it and I'm sure. Well, I think it was just released either today or Monday

472
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,940
So it is a it's a pretty wicked eye pot. I'd have to say

473
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,940
That's kind of cool. If you get one

474
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,940
Tell us all about it. So we can figure out what the heck the deal is there because

475
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,940
Sounds pretty unique

476
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:43,940
And just listen to one of the episodes and you're talking extensively about how

477
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,940
You guys make your income and you're talking about go daddy

478
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,940
And I've been using go daddy pretty much

479
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,940
Now I'm going to use this for all my domains. I've got about a hundred domains

480
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,940
All in there right now give or take a

481
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:07,940
Redshirt with them and their interface is really great. So I like it

482
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,940
And would like to see some discounts on some of their nails

483
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,940
And so that would be awesome or some bulk for an old discount

484
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,940
Just register them as I think of them

485
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,940
I'm going to put up a few for auction. See what happened anyway

486
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,940
See you around. Thanks. Bye

487
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,940
Yeah, so a couple things there. First of all, I believe you can

488
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:33,940
If you use well at my own codes, if you use DSC1 as your promo code

489
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,940
And you can find these links in the show notes on any data source code program

490
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,940
You get 10% off of anything you do including renewals. Let me know if that's not true

491
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:47,940
Of course, go daddy promo code DSC2 gets you $5 off any order of $30

492
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,940
Or more and if you want to domain name for $695

493
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Use a code DSC3

494
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,940
So I think I can

495
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,940
I hope I'm not speaking out of turn here because we had the lawyers in the room yesterday

496
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,940
Up in Nokia and you know and the deal is pretty much set

497
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,940
Although not set in stone so don't go blabbing about it everywhere

498
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,940
But the whole point of the one of the points of the trip

499
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:18,940
Was I really am excited about this Nokia and 810 web tablet

500
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,940
It it for me truly is it's the missing link between

501
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,940
My laptop which as you know is a Mac these days

502
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,940
And my and my cell phone it kind of sits right in the middle

503
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,940
And it's perfect for all of the just you know whip it out and need a real key

504
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,940
Just whip it out baby. I need a real keyboard

505
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,940
I need some real functionality. It's a great device

506
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,940
And what we've done is we've gone out and we've cut a deal

507
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,940
Again, it's not completely signed sealed delivered

508
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,940
But I expected all to go as planned and the deal is that any anyone who wants to

509
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,940
Want a network as a part of our seller payment initiative

510
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,940
We'll be able to sell these devices to their audience at a discount

511
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,940
I'm talking discount cheaper than you I mean it should be cheaper than you can get it anywhere

512
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,940
Of course anyone can you know decide not to make any profit and sell it however they want

513
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,940
But it'll be cheaper than you can find it anywhere that I found online

514
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:16,940
So it'll be a great deal to anyone who's listening to a show on the on the pod showing network

515
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,940
And of course I'll be pimpin it out here and you'll be able to buy it using one of my codes

516
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,940
I'm really looking forward to it part of our seller payment initiative

517
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:31,940
Hey Adam it's Alex Ross here and we're down to beach California

518
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,940
We're listening to episode 64 I think and you were talking about seller payment

519
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,940
When you advertise and pedal stuff you really believe in

520
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,940
That well it works. I've been listening those go daddy ads for a time immemorial

521
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,940
And finally purchase one and got something to say

522
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,940
Block it with your new quick blogs. So I'm blogging it and I'm going to throw it out there on the show

523
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,940
And hopefully some people will take a look at it. It's a lot of fun

524
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,940
Just quirky and kind of a thoughts rattling around my brain

525
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:09,940
But it is blog dot loss and roll dot com blog dot loss and roll dot com and it's good

526
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,940
All right, thanks again for all the work you do

527
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,940
No, I like to say fuck you

528
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,940
Oh, I

529
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:23,940
Yeah, I'm thank you very much if you use my code or someone else's code appreciate it and this let me tell you

530
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,940
When it comes to consumer goods and services

531
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,940
This is where I think if we were ever looking for a business model for podcasting this is it

532
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,940
I think and no, I fact I know for a fact that

533
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:41,940
People could make a lot of money in seller payment even with relatively small audiences

534
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:48,940
It's just been proven over and over again. So I'll look for more offers that your favorite pod show host or producer

535
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,940
We'll be bringing to you on a program very soon. Now, of course, lots of people get sick and tired

536
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,940
I'm talking about this like this. Yeah, what's going on? This is Zach and Las Vegas

537
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:06,940
And I was recently listening to the DSC 684 where you're explaining how pod show makes money

538
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:13,940
And well, here, let me play a little clip to tell you that seller payment

539
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,940
I eat the idea of me promoting products or services in my show.

540
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,940
However, I feel fit and then essentially, well, I don't get paid

541
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,940
But anyone else on the pod show network who participates does get paid

542
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,940
My money goes straight back into the pot. So that's another way pod show makes money

543
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,940
Okay, so that's another way pod show makes money

544
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,940
But don't you get paid by pod show?

545
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:44,940
So essentially, you're making money off this seller payment

546
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:50,940
I seriously hope you think of a better word for that because that's just fucking gay

547
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:56,940
So, you know, don't be modest, don't lie. We know that you have like butt loads of money

548
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:04,940
You know, and that you make money off a pod show and some of that money comes from selling ads on the daily source code

549
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:11,940
And you want to know something speaking of ads, what the fuck is this Christmas movie that you're pimping before and after the show

550
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,940
It's just 30 seconds of my life that I'll never get back

551
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:23,940
It's 30 seconds that you could be using you fucking lazy bastard to put more content into the daily source code

552
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:31,940
Maybe a little bit more effort, you know, not like, oh, I'm so busy with meetings and I'm so tired and blah blah blah

553
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,940
That I can't do this show every day bullshit dude, you sleep right?

554
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,940
You don't have to wake up at 7 o'clock in the morning in an office

555
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:45,940
And then wow, there's 50 people in here that I have to present for you know, you got to drive somewhere

556
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:51,940
You got to walk somewhere, take a little portable recorder and just hey, I'm walking down the street to this meeting

557
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,940
I just wanted to say hi to everybody. I'm really looking forward to it blah blah blah

558
00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:01,940
Put it up daily source code every day. There it is fantastic. No effort. You're lazy at him

559
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,940
And it's getting even lazier you're putting ads in the show

560
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:11,940
That's more time that you could be talking you can play a comment from somebody maybe not talk about something political

561
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:18,940
Oh my god, what a concept wow, you know, okay, so there's a lot of other things that are really pissing me off about the DSC

562
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,940
You want to know something. I'm going to do something about it

563
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,940
And I'm sure I'm not alone on this and I'm sure a lot of people are going to be very happy

564
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,940
I'm doing this. I registered fuck you Adam Curry dot com

565
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:37,940
And I'm going to create the fuck you Adam Curry podcast and everything that I hate about every daily source code that you produce for a week

566
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:43,940
I'm going to complain about it every week whatever show you post

567
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,940
I'm writing notes for

568
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,940
And if you don't put a show up that week fantastic

569
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,940
I'm going to be on your ass like white on rice

570
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:58,940
So the fuck you Adam Curry podcast coming soon to fuck you Adam Curry dot com go there right now

571
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,940
There's a number on there. You can call in leave a message

572
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:25,940
As I'm back and I start reminiscing about my existence and how I have lifted

573
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,940
When I learn what your people even still something to happen then you get my teeth away

574
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,940
I'll take for example the time that I was married

575
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,940
Yes, I think I was across a threshold she was carried we would do an okay

576
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,940
Just about a minute in the shit now

577
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,940
I want to give you get it shit on me

578
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,940
Oh boy how it happens far and then scattered in the dirt

579
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,940
So I was nauseous all day

580
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,940
It's a real losing little way

581
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,940
But always I learned to forgive

582
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,940
Swallow my pockets off that fabric just forever

583
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,940
Open my heart and took her back in

584
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,940
Bitchie went for somebody else again

585
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,940
So with the punch line I got to be a punch line

586
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,940
With the punch line I got to be a punch line

587
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,940
With the punch line I got to be a punch line

588
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,940
Hold in my breath and I'm waiting to say

589
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,940
So many ways to drown I know

590
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,940

Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, anyway, the website actually exists.

680
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,580
That was pretty interesting.

681
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,820
Thank you, AdamCurry.com.

682
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:59,660
Hey, you know what?

683
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:03,380
As long as you bought that with one of my codes, it's okay.

684
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,660
All right, I'm gonna wrap it down and get you ready

685
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,220
for the weekend with some live love spirals.

686
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,700
Hey, Adam, it's Andy B.

687
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,420
So hey, I just wanna check in with you

688
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:16,420
to let you know that I just released the Love Spirals

689
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,500
debut performance in Second Life on Pod Show Island

690
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,140
on October 27th.

691
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,140
I released it as a special episode

692
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,740
of the channel The Love Spirals podcast today.

693
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,900
Ta-da!

694
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:34,100
So you can now hear that nearly one hour acoustic performance

695
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,700
in its entirety.

696
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:40,700
And I also selected one track from the live set

697
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,580
to put up on the PodSafe Music Network.

698
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,460
So I went with our second single, this truth,

699
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,660
this kind of an upbeat number,

700
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,460
and I think the recording turned out really fine.

701
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,620
So I just thought you might wanna share it

702
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,100
with your DSC listeners.

703
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,140
I hope you dig it.

704
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,300
And here it is, this truth acoustic by Love Spirals.

705
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:18,540
We've been together a decade.

706
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:24,660
We're always gone by and we're playing covered now.

707
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,660
When I think back on our years together

708
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:32,660
The only thing I wonder is why

709
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:37,660
We didn't begin our lives, my son

710
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,660
From the first time it

711
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:46,660
Wherever moment we've shared its precious

712
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:50,660
And there's nothing better said I would really know

713
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,660
She will never take away from that

714
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:57,660
And that's nothing cheaper said I would really know

715
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:02,660
She will never take away this truth

716
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:09,660
Which you belong to me and I belong to you

717
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:29,660
This year it will be a decade

718
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:35,660
We've stood together hand in hand

719
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:40,660
Then each other ever there

720
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:44,660
Just in the younger understand

721
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,660
Oh, we have never been this dream

722
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:53,660
I don't think we ever were

723
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,660
But doesn't seem to be how need that

724
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:02,660
I'll give love care for them

725
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:06,660
She will never take away from that

726
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,660
And that's nothing cheaper said I would really know

727
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:15,660
She will never take away this truth

728
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:23,660

00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:31,660
