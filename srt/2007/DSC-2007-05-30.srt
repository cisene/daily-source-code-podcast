1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Another pod-show pod-cast.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,720
Stick!

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,240
We interrupt the show for a special announcement from Pod-show HQ.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,120
Attention pod-casters, viewers and listeners, Pod-show needs you to help us suck less.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,760
Help us suck less, help us suck less, Pod-show needs you to help us suck less.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,960
Hey, it's Cali Lewis from Geek Creek TV.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,160
Pod-show needs your help.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,200
We're always trying to improve, and this time, we need you to help us suck less.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,800
We're creating a special place to pod-show suck less, so let's suck less.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Pod-show.com.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,600
That's right, once you're there, you can join our Superpanel.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,000
Give us your feedback, earn points, and get valuable stuff.

It's fun, it's easy, and most of all, you help us suck less.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,400
Help us suck less, help us suck less, Pod-show needs you to help us suck less.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,600
Now, back to the show.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,600
Delta Sierra Charley, 6-1-1.

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,200
Turn this!

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,800
We don't need no sticking friends in it.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,600
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
One fasting kiss.

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,760
That you're happy.

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,600
I was in a lake, and I thought you'd grab it for me

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I got to win a fair

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
I thought you'd do a fair

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,600
You thought I'd not do a fair

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Well, I can't doubt I'm running out of money

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I forget to pray

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,600
You know, I need to throw your lives in cold

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Those have gone worse then

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Now the photo organisations

35
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I thought you'd win a fair

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:03:12,600
All the leaves are dry, and the sky is ready, and the sky is gray, and the sky is gray,

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:22,600
I am watching all the way on a weather plane, and my little tail,

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I am watching all the way, and the sky is gray, and the sky is gray, and the sky is gray,

39
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:46,600
and the sky is concreted away, and I am not in the same place.

40
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Motherland Board of businesses

41
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
international pop festival.

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
It's California DREAMEN.

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
How cool is that that is now on the

44
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Pond Safe Music Network?

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
I could not believe my luck when this showed up today.

46
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,600
And it fits so well because it's almost been a week

47
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,600
that has just been pissing down all across the

48
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
United Kingdom, continental Europe.

49
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
It's crap.

50
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Yesterday was just a teeny weeny bit better.

51
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
But we still had rain throughout the day with big

52
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Columbus Nimbus clouds and just a

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
accumulation of moisture.

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Now, about this song because you're saying, how could this be

55
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Pond Safe?

56
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,600
This is what I love about what's happening with

57
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
the back catalog essentially.

58
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Now, you know, the young Palette and I have been working for

59
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
about two years now trying to get the hit test up and running

60
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
in some form of legal fashion.

61
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I think we have that licked by the way.

62
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
And I hope I hope I hope to be able to start

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
very soon.

64
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
But now you see that there are these smart

65
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,600
marketers and smaller really small independent

66
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
labels who are picking up back catalog that the mainstream

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
record companies just can't sell.

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Don't have the ability to sell or maybe it's not worth it

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
to them except for time-life books and time-life

70
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
records, of course, which have great collections.

71
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
But, you know, who wants to buy that when you see these

72
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
like, you know, dead people hockin' him.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Anyway, on this Monterey, actually, let me,

74
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
what's the name of this label?

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Now, on the Pod Safe Music Network, you can just click on it

76
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
and I'll tell me who the label is.

77
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Razer and Ty is the name of this label.

78
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
New York-based Razer and Ty, one of the fastest growing

79
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
independent entertainment companies in the United States.

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Razer and Ty successfully sells audio and video products

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
through traditional retail distribution,

82
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
direct response, television advertising, and e-commerce-based

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
websites.

84
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,600
And so, from that CD, which they've now turned Pod Safe

85
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
very, very smart because I know people are going to buy this.

86
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Let me to play another track.

87
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
They have the Who My Generation.

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm playing this straight from the website.

89
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
If you're a member of the Pod Safe Music Network

90
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
as a Podcaster, you get access to all these songs

91
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
so you can play them in your show.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Oh, hold on a second.

93
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
I messed that up, didn't I?

94
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Hey!

95
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I need to flip that little box there.

96
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Let's try it again.

97
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
See what?

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Oh, man!

99
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Can you believe how cool this is?

100
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,600
So, actually, I'm going to put the player

101
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
for this album on mycurry.com site

102
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
because then you can listen to all those tracks for free.

103
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
And of course, if you want to get more information,

104
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
you can go and buy them.

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
All right, everybody.

106
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
It's hump day.

107
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
We're halfway through.

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Some interesting news already coming to us here

109
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
from the UK.

110
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I'm opening up the BBC News website.

111
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Music site, last FM, bought by CBS.

112
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,600
For $280 million, 140 million pounds.

113
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Of course, that is probably the largest ever acquisition

114
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,600
of a UK-based company, which last FM is.

115
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
And I think this is very smart of CBS.

116
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Last FM, of course, streams music.

117
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,600
In an interesting way, you know, that, but it's a social,

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,600
music network, social, music listening network.

119
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Maybe it should be social, music experience network

120
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
is probably better.

121
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
A lot of people really love last FM.

122
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
And I think rightfully so.

123
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Now, their problem, of course, is with all these streaming rights.

124
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,600
And, you know, we've been talking about the copyright royalty board.

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
So these guys are probably sitting down and going,

126
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
like, shit, what are we going to do?

127
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,600
You know, someone's going to get around to us sooner or later.

128
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
And to have CBS, who, of course,

129
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,600
know very well how to negotiate rights with,

130
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,600
with organizations such as ASCAP, BMI, and the RIA.

131
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
There'll be perfect, perfect.

132
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
So the community, I think, will benefit from this.

133
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
And I think this is just a great, great acquisition.

134
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Is that that Quincy guy?

135
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Isn't that Quincy?

136
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,600
What are I hearing in the background here, by the way?

137
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I'm hearing music from something.

138
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Oh, am I playing something?

139
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
How the hell does that happen?

140
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Are you hearing that as well?

141
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
This is very strange.

142
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Let me see, is it?

143
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Oh, what's that?

144
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
It's coming out of...

145
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Where the hell is it coming from?

146
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Hold on, peeps.

147
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Got to check this one out.

148
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Okay, yes.

149
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Okay, found it.

150
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
That was the who playing in the background.

151
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Yeah.

152
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,600
I think that's, let me see if it says anything.

153
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Mr. Stixol, who's Mr. Stixol.

154
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Yeah, as part of the acquisition,

155
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
the last of him management team, including found this Felix Miller,

156
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Martin Stixol and Richard Jones,

157
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
will continue to independently run the online network.

158
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Okay.

159
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
There must be someone from CBS saying something.

160
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Hmm.

161
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Right.

162
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Yeah.

163
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Last of course, last of them is one of the fastest growing online communities on there.

164
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Last of him, strength in building communities around.

165
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Music, and it kind of was central to UBM.

166
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
BBubbubbubbubbubbubbubbubbub os,

167
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
The demographics also play perfectly CBS as ago.

168
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Yep, I think and write very, very smart spot on on that one.

169
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Got an email from Nicholas Coolner,

170
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,600
a Nicholas said I think I found Trinity on Google Maps.

171
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I was playing around with a new street view feature.

172
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Checked out the Pod show.

173
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
HQ location.

174
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,720
you location. You've got to see this. This is un-for-can-wheel. There's Trinity. You can see

175
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,080
your ass sticking out. I didn't know about this feature from Google, and it's given me

176
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,160
some new ideas about what to do with Trinity. I told you that when I got back to San

177
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,880
Francisco, I'd be announcing something. And now it's like, oh, man, I can add something

178
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,360
very cool with this feature. Think about what we can do. And the question, of course, is

179
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,800
what does the frequency that these pictures are updated? I know that my apartment, the condo

180
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,840
in San Francisco, is still shows up as a building site, meaning it has to be at least five

181
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,880
years old. That picture, but the street view, how often are these updated? And how does that work?

182
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Does anyone know? Because this is just flipping me out. I totally dig it.

183
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:46,120
Hey Adam, this is Chris and Germany. And I think you should go with part of Germany to address

184
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,960
an all-life pic because... No, it kind of dropped out there. What are you saying? He's giving

185
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,120
me suggestions on where we should put our headquarters for part-show Germany. And did it just

186
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:01,000
suggest, just, like, sick? Interesting. Chris and I like to have a lot of growing a lot of growing

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,080
economy, excuse me. And I think this would be a good chance to climb with the economy in

188
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:19,080
East Germany, and to build a big partial HQ here in East and Germany. And I think media

189
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:26,200
cities like Colone are dying out. I think the next big media city will be Berlin.

190
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,800
That's interesting. Do you think the Colone is dying out? Berlin is going to be a big

191
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,120
couple of people who said Berlin. Apparently there's like the big Sony media center that you

192
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,720
can write offices in. I don't know if we want to do that. I mean, that's not really us.

193
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,760
You know, we're in shortage here in London, which is pretty much the wrong side of the

194
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,680
tracks. Where we feel extremely comfortable, by the way. So I'm not too sure.

195
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:55,240
Uh, come to East Germany. We have the most beautiful girls here. Uh, come to East Germany. We

196
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,560
have the most beautiful girls here. Okay. Well, I think it's clear we're going to have to make

197
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:06,200
the decision based upon the quotient of beautiful girls to the city. So the contenders now are

198
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,520
Berlin. We have Munich is still kind of in the running. Colone is a high favorite, but we have

199
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:18,120
no guarantee that there are cute women there. And Hamburg, I think those are the four contenders

200
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,080
that we should be looking at. And by the way, cute guys, good too. Just send if you're really

201
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,200
cool, then you'll go to your Potcho Plus account, which of course you have. And you'd upload

202
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:36,520
some pictures of cute boys and girls so we can make a, uh, uh, a fully educated decision.

203
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,960
And then of course, you could just put that into the comments right on daily source code.com.

204
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,560
But if you're the lazy bugger, then go ahead and just email me a picture. Okay.

205
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,720
Let's see, what else? A lot of stuff came in to the email box today. Oh, I want to remind you that

206
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,600
episode number five of boomed is out. That's the original series game show in audio from Potcho.

207
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,440
Johnny Todd. Is that what he's still called?

208
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,320
And on episode number five, it's Dawn and Drew. And it's, uh, it's always great to hear two people

209
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,000
who know each other very well, completely intimately just talking amongst themselves. But to compare

210
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,560
their knowledge is probably even funnier. So you'll want to. And who of course will win the

211
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,360
Nokia N800 web tablet of the two? I have a feeling that the way those guys are, you know,

212
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,240
if like Dawn one and she wouldn't let Drew touch it. Have they, uh, has their, uh, interview

213
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,240
with Ziggy Marley come out yet? Hold on. Uh, that would mean that Ziggy would be on the, because I

214
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,680
thought he was going to put a song on the Pot save music network, hold on. Just do a search for Ziggy

215
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,040
see if it's up yet. I'm surprising, you know, it's like it's hard to keep up with all the things that

216
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:57,880
are going on there. Ziggy, no, no, no. Yeah, Ziggy Marley, shit. When did that go up? Let's listen to this a bit of

217
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:05,080
that into the group is the title of it on the Pot save music network. Well, screw me. Who knew, let's

218
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
listen for a second.

219
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:45,080
That's what we've become into the group. Come for the ride.

220
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Ziggy, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

221
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:42,080
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no we are talking about something higher.

222
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,080
Change this time

223
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080

224
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080

And free your slip

226

I wanna free my slip

227
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,080
Humanity, your mind

228
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,080
You're not the day you can change this time

229
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,080
I'd love to fly, I'd love to cry

230
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,080
I'd love to fly

231

Trudus do what

Where will you sort, self just to find behind

233
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Trudus do what

234
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,280
Where we get to fly, but you

00:15:52,280 --> 00:16:05,280
For we escape from the surface of what we've become
