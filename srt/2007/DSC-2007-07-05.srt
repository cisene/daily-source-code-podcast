1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
In a world where women wear comfortable shoes and technology has changed the way you get

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,920
your entertainment.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,760
This is the pod show network, no big media, no excuses, no BS.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,680
The share Charlie's six-to-niner was $16 billion worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,680
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,680
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

7
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,680
People is the dormitory, but there's a beautiful crowd.

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,680
I don't know where to go, but today, when I pass the audition routine, I want to go to the world.

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,680
Life is like this, we know that it's going to arrive when you miss it.

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,680
You have to realize it, no?

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:19,680
I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go.

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:37,680
I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go.

13
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,680
I don't know where to go.

14
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,680
I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go.

15
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:59,680
I don't know where to go.

16
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:29,680
I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go.

17
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:44,680
I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go, but I don't know where to go.

18
00:03:44,680 --> 00:04:03,680
I don't know where to go, but I don't know exactly where to go, but I think so.

19
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,680
Whatever you want

20
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,680
You're so fucking special

21
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,680
I wish I was special

22
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
But I'm okay

23
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Nothing like a nice mash up to warm you up on a chilly day in the UK

24
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Of course, and of course you just don't hear this shit and up on the ring

25
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
What's the last time you heard a French rap?

26
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Maybe you gave up listening to the radio

27
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
He jazzy, brum mashed it up for us

28
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Radiohead's creep

29
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,680
And Oxmo Puccino's rap

30
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Oxmo Puccino

31
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
He's a Frenchman

32
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
I guess he's a cap's brother

33
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Hey everybody, how you doing?

34
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680
It's a daily source code episode number six hundred and twenty nine coming to you from

35
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Yet again, another overcast thunder clouded, filled, thunder cloud filled

36
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Um

37
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Suburb of Surrey, let's just call it that

38
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Better known as Guilford G-Towner on the west side in the curry manner

39
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Boy oh boy

40
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,680
The week is going by really really quick for a number of reasons one of course

41
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
And that may be for most Americans

42
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,680
And we had to forth the July celebration so that does kind of give you a nice little break

43
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
I think a lot of companies may actually have today off

44
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,680
They might even have the rest of the week off

45
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,680
I know what Potcho I think today is a holiday though

46
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,680
There's a couple of meetings and people are coming in and stuff is happening in Friday

47
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
We always have a food bar

48
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
Food bar Friday, which basically means everything's food bar

49
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
So let's break out the beer, let's break out the pizza and let's hang out and complain

50
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,680
And bitch and moan and laugh and smile and cry and get hammered

51
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,680
And this is a tradition that Ron and I have carried forth in all of our companies

52
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,680
At think new ideas are previous company we called it think drink

53
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Same thing Friday and it would be actually five o'clock in San Francisco

54
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,680
We do it at four o'clock for some reason what people do start earlier

55
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,680
And it's nice but we're going to have a special one this Friday because

56
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Well, we've been in meetings and in conference and congress I should say

57
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,680
With each other with the company with all disciplines departments

58
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
It's a part of us starting to suck less

59
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,680
And so we have we're ready to present to the entire company

60
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
So everyone is on the same ticket

61
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
And I'm very excited about it

62
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Some of the things that we're thinking of you've already heard me talk about

63
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Or you've probably seen some of the stuff

64
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Yeah, it's I think that the things are going to happen pretty quickly now

65
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Because we've got everything all stuff is in place

66
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Now we are in the process of connecting all the dots

67
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,680
So things actually work in departments communicate for the right reasons

68
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,680
And it's tough man building a company I got to tell you more about that later

69
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
By the way, are we talking about another company in the podcasting space?

70
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Of course I'd like to refer to it as independently produced media

71
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Yesterday was the fourth of July show and I knew that the and it was funny because I had a whole bunch of

72
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Collins and stuff scheduled

73
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Stuff I was going to just run almost like a regular show

74
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,680
And then I really got into it and I got into a feeling proud to be an American

75
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
And proud to be a world citizen if you will

76
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
And I knew that that was bound to set off some people

77
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Interestingly enough, it's set off one of my my good friends, good friend of the show

78
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
I should say James

79
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Who calls in regularly, you recall James recently got his computer bag

80
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,680
And his iPod and the cell phone jack and so everything was gone

81
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
And he was bummed out so we hadn't heard from him a while

82
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,680
And then he tuned into yesterday's show and

83
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
He wasn't too happy about it

84
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Adam, dear Adam, it's James, I'm left in message for a long time

85
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,680
I'll be very busy boy anyway, I felt compelled to renew this morning

86
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
Is 6, 20 years

87
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
It would make a lot of enemies over this one

88
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
Fuck yeah, I wasn't early sick

89
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,680
I'm there again, you be who who

90
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Yeah, I just made me feel completely crazy and horrible

91
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,680
And also, yeah, you're right, you're a mixture of people

92
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
So you can even own the country, you don't need it

93
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Okay, so I'm just gonna stop it there

94
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
James is obviously, his point is already clear

95
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,680
That he was nauseated by the Americanism, my expelled yesterday on this program

96
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,680
And so here come the arguments and there's a reason for this

97
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,680
And of course, James, you know, I respect you, I love you, your friend of the show

98
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680
So, you know, don't take it personally, we're having a

99
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,680
We're just having a conversation in my typical format where you can't interrupt me

100
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,680
Because I've got the pause button, I love that system, by the way

101
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Okay, so what do they teach you in school, James, let me ask you that first

102
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,680
These are the types of blanket statements we got to get rid of

103
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,680
Let's stop with the, you jumped the country, you stole the country

104
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,680
First of all, who's you, it was you

105
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,680
It was you guys, it was people from mother England, it was British people

106
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,680
They jumped the country, they jumped and by the way, again, what do you learn in school here?

107
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,680
This has been the modest operandi for the United Kingdom, for Britain, for a long, long time

108
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,680
There's a reason why many countries in this world, including India, including the West Indies

109
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,680
Speak the Queen's English and quite well and actually love your queen

110
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
There's a reason because

111
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,680
Because you're columnist, you've gone out and jumped everyone's fucking country, including the United States

112
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
But what happened was, you know, something changed

113
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Different views were able to bubble up, but not being suppressed by the

114
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,680
The status quo of how things were running in England

115
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Okay, and so it became a culture, it became an adventurous culture

116
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,680
People who went to America often didn't make it, they died, and they were Brits, Brits, I tell you

117
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,680
You guys, uh, maybe, um, and you know, I, I, I studied this, I'm a student of

118
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Well, I'm a student of

119
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
And now we're from our spine here

120
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
It's the Yanks, versus the Brits

121
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,680
We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows that it's a parent to see

122
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Let's just like you and me, it's the Yanks and the Brits

123
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,680
Yeah, the Yanks versus the Brits

124
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Mind the gap, yes, please do, okay, so

125
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,680
I believe, no, let me, let me step back one, one little step here

126
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,680
There is a tremendous envy in the United Kingdom

127
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,680
In my world, which is the world of media, that's what I pay attention to the most

128
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,680
It does not go for politics, as an example, but for media

129
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,680
To be successful in the United States

130
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,680
Interestingly enough, there is an incredible hunger

131
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,680
In the American media market, to be successful in the United Kingdom

132
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Now it's for two different reasons, and this is just the way I see it, the way I'm going to call it

133
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,680
In the UK, your success is limited

134
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,680
You can probably, you know, if you're Terry Wogan, then you can do 8 million pounds a year

135
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,680
16 million dollars a year in salary

136
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,680
I think he's probably at the top of the game everywhere

137
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,680
That is pale in comparison to what you can do with the successful media

138
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,680
Property, career, company, whatever you want to call it in the United States

139
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Mainly due to size, it's very simple

140
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,680
There's 350 million people living in America, or closer to 300 million

141
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,680
So that's just simple law of big numbers

142
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,680
Conversely, you see all American media people

143
00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Really wanting the legitimization, the credibility of making it in the United Kingdom

144
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Where the Queen's English is spoken

145
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,680
That's it, we are two countries, two cultures separated by a common language

146
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Here's an example, look, Americans are natural born

147
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,680
I know you thought killers, but I was going to say marketing people

148
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
It's a part of the whole adventure, spirit

149
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Brits went over to the new land, the new country, it's a very big risk, big adventure

150
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Maybe there's some envy of those who did of the ancestors who went over

151
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
It wasn't a long ago after all

152
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
When you do something like that, what do you do?

153
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,680
You send messages back home saying, dude, we're doing great, it's awesome here

154
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,680
From sea to shining, shining sea, the beautiful plains, Oklahoma

155
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Where the wind goes, rustling through all that stuff

156
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
It's marketing, of course, and I'm going to say it sucks

157
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Yeah, we lost the 80% of the people on the trip

158
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,680
So that became the culture of the United States

159
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
And the whole idea is, and this is the nucleus

160
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,680
If you want to work hard and you want to bust your ass, you too can be just as successful as

161
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,680
Pick anyone, X, Y or anyone here, and there's lots of them, because there's lots of them

162
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,680
In general

163
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,680
So, marketing is what we're good at

164
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,680
And of course, like all marketing, it comes across

165
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Brash and loud and often in sincere, you know, and we have to get better

166
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,680
We must get better, because look at our top marketing guy, the CEO of our huge organization

167
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,680
Known as the United States, the president, socks, he sucks it, been marketing

168
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,680
He makes everyone feel like shit, like there's no one in control

169
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
I like this Gordon Brown guy in the UK, by the way

170
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,680
I've been watching him, I've been watching how he speaks and how he addresses the nation

171
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,680
And what he's done in these first few, in this first week essentially, this guy is a good PR guy

172
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,680
I think he's also a really good politician, which he'll make it extremely interesting

173
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,680
So anyway, an example, and actually I should play the rest of your comment, because I can give a better example

174
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
Here we go

175
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Because it isn't meant to be anybody, you know, yeah

176
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
I'm rumbling, look right now

177
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,680
No, no, I was a horrible episode, but I think it's a good fight

178
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,680
I feel so bad that you feel that way, look

179
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Of course, team America, the whole movie is irony, but it is the way the Americans are

180
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,680
And we're not ashamed of it, that's the point

181
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
That is our version of what you call irony

182
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
Okay, we're not idiots

183
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,680
We may be shallow, I'll be the first to admit

184
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,680
Because we've got a layer of marketing around our skin, sure

185
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:03,680
But of course, we understand that team America and yeah, we invented Taco Bell and Band-Aids

186
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Of course, it's irony dude, but at the same time, we invented fucking Band-Aids

187
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,680
We invented Taco Bell, these are not wonderful things for society

188
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,680
I think it is an envy, it's interesting because you pick Band-Aids

189
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,680
They're not called Band-Aids in the United Kingdom, they're called Plasters

190
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,680
Alright, so for years, you refuse to use the Plasters, you know, you refuse to use Band-Aids for Plasters

191
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
And you know, as successful as your plaster companies, I don't know

192
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,680
The Band-Aid Corporation is probably Johnson & Johnson or something like that, they're probably doing okay

193
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,680
The only time you use the word Band-Aid was for the Tribute Band-Aid

194
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
And it was a mega smash, there you go

195
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,680
Anyway, it believed me from where I sit and from what I see and from what I've witnessed

196
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,680
We love each other's countries, we really do love each other's company

197
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,680
We're envious of things the other has or can do

198
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,680
It's just a fact, but look, we are from the same family, we are from the same wood

199
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,680
It's just we have some major cultural differences

200
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,680
And that's okay, it's okay

201
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,680
But I must say that I've noticed a lot of US bashing going on

202
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,680
And it's not really bashing, it's more like, you know, it's your laughing at us

203
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,680
Because, you know, they're, they're these shallow yanks

204
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,680
Well, yes, but that's okay

205
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,680
Because, you know, we see you in a different light as well, but to be nauseated by it

206
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,680
Nah, I don't think so, that's not necessary

207
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,680
I'm proud that you guys can be proud that you're British, I have a sense of what that means

208
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,680
I'll never fully understand it, but I do appreciate it

209
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
In fact, I'm a little bit envious of it in my own way

210
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,680
And all I ask is that you understand the same for us

211
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,680
And, and know that you're welcome, just as I'm welcome here

212
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,680
Which, of course, thanks, Commissioner Blogger is more due to the European Union I agree, obviously

213
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,680
And you're welcome over in the US, let's have some fun together

214
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
He's not the whole point

215
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
I think we're going to do exactly that, aren't we?

216
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,680
On this Saturday, the 7th of July, the life, the life, earth concert

217
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Should be interesting, again, we're working together

218
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,680
So, the world, I can't believe I'm getting myself into this

219
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,680
I'm going to paint myself new corner, but

220
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,680
It's all about marketing, it's all about what you see in the media

221
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,680
That's why blogging is interesting, how it's uncovering things in mainstream media

222
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
And how it's creating things that aren't true as well

223
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,680
It's just a lot, we have to learn, we've got to reinstate our filters, we've got to work on it

224
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Oh, the humanity

225
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
Anyway, so I'm sorry, I gave you a shitty D.S.C.

226
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
I'll try better

227
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,680
The yanks versus the bits

228
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
Mind the gap

229
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Now here's something that's getting a lot of pod play and the pod safe music network

230
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,680
A lot of pod tasks, a lot of independently produced radio shows play in this one

231
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,680
I can kind of understand why Tom Smith says it all and I don't care

232
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,680
Everyone is lining up to get the latest toy

233
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,680
With every fancy buzzword, the reviewers can deploy

234
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,680
It's a wireless browser, music player and a phone

235
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Well, listen up, you apple junkies, because I've got my own

236
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
It's called I Don't Care

237
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,680
Amazing Gadgetree, I Don't Care

238
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,680
The latest in on me, it tells me if what's cool or hot

239
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Actually matters, usually not

240
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,680
I don't care, the new technology I don't care

241
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,680
This modern sophistry, all it does has been done before

242
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,680
But now it's clumsy or an costs more

243
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,680
Every permutation, every variance in you

244
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
It's so the cost of the nation

245
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
As if it was bold and new

246
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,680
Slim responsive elegance, such 16 is sad grace

247
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
It's like a high price to hear

248
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,680
With a logo on her face

249
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
I don't care

250
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Because I don't need to own I don't care

251
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,680
Another telephonic between all this noise and height

252
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,680
I'll come it's not as clear as Skype

253
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,680
I don't care

254
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
I haven't got the time I don't care

255
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,680
To shift the paradigm, I only want to play a song

256
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Good thing that my thumbs are strong

257
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,680
So many times we've seen this sort of marketing before

258
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,680
You can buy a brand new lifestyle at your favorite store

259
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Give up your apartment, your sedan, and both your jobs

260
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,680
To gently stroke the touch screen

261
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,680
And fiddle with the knobs

262
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
It may make stuff more fun to do

263
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
But keeping track is hard

264
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,680
Did you just win at Sudoku or max out your credit card

265
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,680
It's guaranteed to change your life

266
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
It really is the bomb

267
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
Like windows meet the segue

268
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,680
ESP and catch dot com

269
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
I don't care

270
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Your life is more compact

271
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
With a two-year contract of Steve

272
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
I've got a perfect plan

273
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,680
To feed your short attention span

274
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
I don't care

275
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
And so I'm old who I don't care

276
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Those are the things to do

277
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
And if the future is passed me by

278
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
I won't complain because I don't know why

279
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,680
They have new crap to buy and I don't care

280
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
I am

281
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
There you go

282
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
That's part of America's culture

283
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
We come up with the iPhone and then of course we come up with the I don't care

284
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
So yeah

285
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
So apparently one is on its way to me

286
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Via FedEx will see if it makes it through customs

287
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
That'll be interesting to see

288
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
I have been making a bit of a study

289
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Of course I've been thinking about it

290
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,680
In the recent

291
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Twitter episode where they all had their iPhones

292
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,680
And they were talking about cataluess

293
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
Was on that one as well

294
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,680
She had some activation problems

295
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
I'm evaluating because I'm very happy with my Nokia E61I

296
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
Does everything for me

297
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Listening to these reviews

298
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
I haven't really seen anyone right about this yet

299
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
I had expected

300
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,680
Technically it wouldn't have been such a problem

301
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
I would have expected for you to be able to synchronize

302
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Through Wi-Fi

303
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Maybe you can but I don't read that anywhere

304
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
It seems pretty much like you got a plug it in

305
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Which of course also charges the device

306
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
Or at least it should charge the device

307
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
And then everything syncs up with your iTunes

308
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Which means you really have to have the computer

309
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
That you sync it up with

310
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
Along for the ride if you really want it to be

311
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Most effective

312
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
Because I'm not a big music guide

313
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
How fucked up does that sound

314
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
But I just don't listen to music on my iPod

315
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
I can't stand it because I know exactly the order in which it's coming in

316
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
And I like serendipity so I want my shows

317
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
I want to be able to get my audio and video shows

318
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
And of course I can subscribe to those iTunes

319
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
However, if I'm on the road

320
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,680
I can't just check and see if so and so put out the latest show

321
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Or if I can't just listen to the New York Times front page

322
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
If it has finally been posted to get in later in later these days

323
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,680
I love listening to CNN radio reports

324
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,680
So I won't be able to get that unless I continually synchronize the machine

325
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
So I'm sure that they did this because they didn't want

326
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
Because I guess you can access the network

327
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,680
The network in two ways one is through your cellular data connection

328
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Your edge connection the other one is of course through Wi-Fi

329
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
And then your direct connects with three ways

330
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,680
And I guess I think when you're pretty easy to restrict synchronizing

331
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
I think about it your address book your calendar

332
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,680
I can synchronize my calendar on the fly through my edge network

333
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Whenever I want I don't have to necessarily

334
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,680
Physically hook up to a computer

335
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,680
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm just totally missing it here

336
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Maybe it is possible but I haven't read anyone about it

337
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
So either it's possible and everyone's just loving it and doing it

338
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
And forgot to write about it or no one's thinking about it either way

339
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Please let me know

340
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,680
To rock this mother out

341
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,680
This is Zach from Las Bandakis

342
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
And be sure to enter the shameless plug cast on July 9

343
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
For my interview with the one

344
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
The only searchersy type

345
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
I'm like the force and comfort podcasting

346
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
I never expected this to get to where it is

347
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,680
There's no reason to ever walk into a sandwich ever again

348
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,680
I go into like a Barnes & Noble when I get depressed

349
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,680
Probably the secret service agent in my door soon

350
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
Well there goes my access

351
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,680
They're actually communicating very well together because they're taking shifts

352
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
To stay awake

353
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,680
Be sure to check it out at shamelessplotf.com

354
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Have been met

355
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,680
Are you having the plans or endeavors in the near future?

356
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Sleep

357
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Yeah, I've been following the plug cast

358
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
Interesting, I like that

359
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
And it always sends a couple promos through

360
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,680
And guys got something good going on there, appreciate that

361
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Oh, I discovered something pretty cool, well actually very uncool

362
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,680
I had already kind of suspected that I was having some trouble with the voicemail service

363
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,680
That sends me the files when you leave a voicemail on the numbers

364
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,680
Which are always listed at DailySourceCode.com

365
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,680
And you should have in yourself phone for when you just can't stand what I'm saying

366
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
And want to call in and bitch at me

367
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
That's why we tell you to enter the plus

368
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Because it really helps you no matter where you are it will work

369
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
And yesterday or the day before

370
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,680
The Firf, Chris McIntyre from Pod Show HQ

371
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:54,680
He said he said I called I phoned in my first report for the developer stuff that we're doing

372
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,680
So be on a lookout for it and I keep waiting and waiting and yesterday I show I

373
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
I just didn't get any voicemails and I'm like crap man

374
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,680
I can't believe you sure what number did you call so he told me what number he called

375
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
So I go into it's J2.com is what I use

376
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,680
So I go into the J2 control panel and message center and loan behold for some reason

377
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Certain messages it may be related to length

378
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
It just doesn't forward to the email

379
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,680
So who knows what freaking gems I may have been missing it really upsets me

380
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:28,680
And of course it totally makes sense that nylon has been calling things in

381
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
He's pretty long-winded

382
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,680
So that stuff probably just wasn't getting through to my mailbox

383
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
So I'm really bummed about it

384
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,680
I have a new process now so in the morning I go and I download all the most recent comments

385
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,680
neatly organized. There is a way for me to do that and I can go through them and check them

386
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
This really sucks

387
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,680
Anyway, the good news is I found the first little blur

388
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
At the office

389
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,680
But I'm bummed just saying hello

390
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,680
But I'm bummed to the game from HQ

391
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
But I'm bummed and pod shot

392
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,680
Hey Adam what's up this is the graphic calling and pod show HQ

393
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,680
Now here you're talking about a lot about this developer network working on the pod show

394
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,680
You don't have to spend the time in a little bit and you need to know our first update

395
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,680
First off, one of the APIs we have in place already that people may or may not know about is our author and the API

396
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,680
This allows people to upload shows along with all the related information that Kyle biscuits and keywords

397
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,680
To the pod show website, well that actually being on the pod show website

398
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,680
We have four or five applications that are using it already including

399
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Not only cast blaster but good blaster, FDL and Ubercaster as well

400
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,680
So just letting people out there know that this author and API is available

401
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Make sure to check it out on developer.pot show.com

402
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,680
Secondly, we are working on the channel's API

403
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,680
See some screenshots in your feed

404
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,680
On Terry.com, talking about some stuff

405
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
So I just want to touch on a little bit

406
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
A lot of exciting stuff there

407
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Considering that channel and collecting is one of the most powerful features on the pod show website

408
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,680
It might make sense to be about this feature next to allow people

409
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
You know, it's a create and share playlist

410
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,680
In samples of information

411
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,680
And different audio files that are collected on pod show and from around the web

412
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Finally, I don't want to go too deep into this one

413
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,680
And I'll just mention if I had an Uber nerds

414
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,680
But there is a spiked up there called Twitter, Twitter.com

415
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,680
And we may be working on something to release some cool features for that

416
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,680
So if you're not going to get to deep into it

417
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,680
People who want to stay up to date with what's going on with the development

418
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,680
We're going to always visit developer.pot show.com

419
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Subscribe to the blog and keep up to date

420
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
As always, people get email as well

421
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,680
And info.com with questions or if they need help

422
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
Check it and I'll talk to you later

423
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,680
All right, the first blur of everybody

424
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,680
Thank you very much Chris McIntyre, excellent dude

425
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,680
Yeah, that's all part of what we're going to be talking about company wide tomorrow

426
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,680
You know what?

427
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
I'm not going to tell you about it today

428
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Because I want to make sure that everyone in the company

429
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,680
Here's it from the walls of the company first

430
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
But I am very excited, it makes total sense

431
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,680
We can execute well, we can execute quickly

432
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,680
We fix so many fucking problems

433
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Particularly with our website

434
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Remember, remember remember the fifth of November

435
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,680
Gunpowder trees and a plot

436
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,680
I remember that we built this thing upside down

437
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Not purposely, but that's what we've basically figured out

438
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,680
We've built the fucker upside down

439
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Court City PD, the number one online police drama series

440
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,680
Is now available, subscribe now and get the entire first season on your iPod

441
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,680
And get ready for an action pack season 2

442
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Coming July 2007

443
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,680
Court City dot podshow dot com

444
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,680
This summer when you buy coke

445
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,680
You get music

446
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,680
You can win an iPod or freak songs on iTunes

447
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,680
So maybe you guys have been sending in the tombs that you've been getting

448
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Look, here's how it works

449
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,680
I need to, in order for these campaigns to work

450
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,680
And for us to show the power of independent media

451
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,680
I need to show some real

452
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Where they call it, customer engagement

453
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,680
So you would help me out personally

454
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
And you would help many other

455
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,680
And this is only for UK audience, everyone outside of the UK

456
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Just plug yours

457
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,680
You would help me tremendously

458
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,680
If you have actually been motivated

459
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,680
To look under the cap of your bottle of coke

460
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,680
And get the number and redeem it

461
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,680
And you actually bought a track off of iTunes with it

462
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,680
If you could call me and let me know that would be very helpful

463
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,680
Because that would actually tell the advertisers that the shit is working

464
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Otherwise, I have to tell them shit ain't working

465
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
It's that simple

466
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,680
And of course, the first thing we can send them is this that I just recorded right now

467
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Yes, just going back briefly to the Fourth of July show

468
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,680
There was one other call that came in that I feel I do have to play

469
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,680
Hi Adam, this is Dave and Philadelphia

470
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,680
The cradle of liberty on independent stay

471
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,680
I'm calling because you made a comment about

472
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,680
How the brits are kind of steering around Asians

473
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,680
I don't know whether we're doing that in the US but I'll tell you after September 11

474
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,680
There were plenty of circumstances

475
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Plenty of incidents where people were getting beat up

476
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,680
Because of the color of their skin

477
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,680
People who were wearing turps

478
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Particularly were getting called terrorists

479
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,680
Drivers particularly had a really tough time of it

480
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,680
And we've got to look at ourselves

481
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,680
To really try hard to get people as people

482
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:41,680
Maybe I found idealistic but I sure hope that if we all just took this back

483
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,680
And really thought about each other sort of as individual

484
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,680
We would do a whole lot better as a country as a society as a world

485
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Too much to ask probably but there's my thought for independence there

486
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Right on man, absolutely so first of all of course I stand corrected

487
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,680
I was not in the United States after 9-11

488
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,680
And I'm sure that there was some of that going on

489
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,680
As I think I said yesterday I have personally not witnessed it

490
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,680
So I think it's excited pretty quickly

491
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,680
And maybe that same thing will happen in the UK

492
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Although it's only been one year since the 7th of July 7th 7

493
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,680
When over 50 people lost their lives in London

494
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:34,680
Interesting by the way how the live earth concert is being held on 7th 7th

495
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
That's kind of funky

496
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,680
But again I think typically British you know we're just going to keep

497
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Play on ahead we'll do something new something fresh

498
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,680
So I agree with what you're saying

499
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,680
And I think that what we're doing here in these independent productions

500
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,680
At least I feel like it's happening in the dialogue

501
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,680
We're having is we got to focus on two things

502
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Keep talking start doing

503
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,680
You know I'm a big fan of just doing stuff

504
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Yes sometimes I do stuff and this of course is part of the risk

505
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,680
You know you you step on someone's toes or go over the boundary

506
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,680
And I'm always quick to apologize and retract if I've done something incorrect

507
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
But we have to start doing things

508
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,680
And I believe the best way to do it is to engage other people in the same concept

509
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Keep talking and start doing

510
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,680
So when I hear people speak like this

511
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,680
I my immediate version of start doing something is to engage them in talking about excuse me

512
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
I really have to disagree

513
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,680
I'm not just going to follow along and say oh yes or be quiet and not say anything

514
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
It doesn't have to be a huge argument

515
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,680
But you know there are things you know you can start up a conversation

516
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,680
And maybe even if you feel that way even if you do want to agree

517
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Still talk about it you may come up with something interesting

518
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,680
All I know is I'm a traveled man

519
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,680
I've been around the world I've been to many many places

520
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,680
I've met many many many people including Iraq

521
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,680
I've I've been there at the height of the war

522
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,680
And it's just fucking people they got iPods and cell phones

523
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Okay, most of the world has that what you see on television

524
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,680
It's not representative of the way it is

525
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:12,680
Okay, so if you do anything this year get a ticket and go to as close as you can get to Iraq

526
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Just go look at the country surrounding it. I'm telling you it is not the way it's portrayed on television and the newspapers

527
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:25,680
And we have this you know this is a this is the downside of our great marketing prowess

528
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,680
You know it can be used for evil

529
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,680
That's what's happening and it's not even on purpose

530
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Most of the people reading the news reading the news off of the teleprompter have never been to these countries either

531
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,680
They can probably just point to it on a map

532
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:45,680
So Americans we certainly have work to do everybody has work to do gosh damn I'm on the soap box today

533
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
I don't know if that's a good thing

534
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:53,680
All right, so I found some other interesting stuff in the voice mail box

535
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,680
Hey, yeah, my name is Davis

536
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,680
And I listen to the DSC

537
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:10,680
But since the reason why I'm calling is and I am at the cushion the cushion of run this malls and we never hear run this malls on your podcast

538
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Then you mall so I thought I would say cover from run just malls

539
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,680
My name is David's malls David's malls

540
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Yes, thank you my okay

541
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,680
Well, I do miss Roger Smalls. That's for sure and David if you truly are as cousin of course

542
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:36,680
Me familiar to familiar Mikasa to Kasa, you know, you're you're part of a one of the biggest friends of the show

543
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,680
Who indeed I had been a bit preoccupied and and only now stopping to think

544
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,680
Where is our friend Roger

545
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:57,680
Yeah, wouldn't it be great if all of a sudden you heard hello at them

546
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,680
Yeah, you don't know what you got till it's gone ain't that a bitch

547
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,680
Oh, I don't it's will for my six just for the side but not on it's indeed a dick

548
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Now that I know how to get his voicemails he might call in there's a couple of me you guys are going while I wild on nylon's ass

549
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,680
Madam, this is Darren from Melbourne Australia, message about the nylon

550
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Jesus this guy is just pony ass first of all every time he spouts his opinion he speaks at a different effect

551
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:41,680
And he's representing some large percentage of your audience and I can assure you that it's purely your opinion nylon

552
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:49,680
You know, you don't represent the whole audience. There's plenty of us who enjoy all aspects of what's going on

553
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,680
And just just kind of down a bit you know I say this is my opinion and I'm like that

554
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:03,680
Okay, yeah, well, that's okay. You know, I don't really mind how he communicates as long as he has a contrarian view

555
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,680
That's the most fun obviously so from New York to the UK we now head over to Vancouver

556
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,680
Add on it's a sale calling from Vansford and I'm also known as beautiful Vancouver British Columbia

557
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,680
Just finished listening to the Charlie 627 and you know the nylon's finally pushed me over the edge

558
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:27,680
I'm actually in marketing. I actually do understand how that whole game works and I certainly understand what it is you're trying to do with the network

559
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,680
And nylon just doesn't get this I mean he doesn't understand that what we're dealing with here is not a conventional

560
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:41,680
You know type of business where you can go out survey customers get fantastic ideas and drive yourself over up the million

561
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Or the couple million of listeners that he wants to have but we're dealing with here is what's classically known as a disruptive technology

562
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,680
And I don't like some like a lecturer like the nylon is but he might be better off

563
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:02,680
If he sat down one day spend some of his value of time and read Clayton Christians and book called Innovators dilemma a classic text and technology based marketing

564
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,680
But it tells you that you know you have to kind of watch out what you're doing you have to be on the leading as you have to try risky new things

565
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:16,680
And frankly that's what your channels are all about I have to be honest. I do agree with him that a couple times when you first started describing the channels

566
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,680
It did sound very much like a technology push it didn't sound like something that necessarily

567
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,680
Added value to the user added some sound of like it added almost some complexities

568
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,680
But you know what I did I'm listening to you and you said hey try one of these things out

569
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,680
So I actually went down today and put trucker Tom's HD video channel up on my iTunes

570
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:42,680
Got a town loading to my Apple TV have been watching it and it's great. I get it. I understand

571
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,680
And you know the easiest way to figure this out is to try it if you like it great if you don't like it time something else

572
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,680
So anyway, I hate to go on a rant to match the my ones, but keep up the good work

573
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,680
Really appreciate what you do it on the show and look forward to seeing more innovation out of the Charlie sealated. Bye.

574
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:06,680
Man, thank you so much. Oh, that makes me feel good. Okay. Well, a couple things here. So first of all

575
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,680
I'll talk about channels at the very end. I do want to talk. I just want to go back to what you said about marketing

576
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,680
Because it is you know marketing is hard and you're right a company like ours

577
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,680
We have to and by the way, I have read the innovators dilemma. I mean, I've read all these books

578
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,680
Oh my goodness. In fact, one of the guys on our board

579
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:34,680
Radi Kamasar wrote the riddle in the monk is another one that you you may have come across a simplistic concept, but hit home

580
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,680
Then there's the you know crossing the chasm. I've read all these books

581
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,680
I'm always interested in it. I love reading you know about people who have been moderately successful

582
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,680
And write and tell me how to be very successful

583
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,680
But yes, you do have to take risks and and and sometimes you just fuck shit up, you know

584
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,680
The big mistake, you know, the on the internet no one knows your dog. Well, on the internet no one knows really

585
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,680
How your company runs, how big it is, what does big mean, you know, what is lots of money, what is

586
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,680
You know, there's all these questions that people, you know, they look at pod show. They may quite as to Google for all

587
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:26,680
I know, I don't know. This sometimes things we do and choices we make and sometimes mistakes we make we are certainly

588
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,680
Treated like we were Google making a mistake within a certain you know within a certain segment

589
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:42,680
Better known as the community whatever that means I think I'm starting to think the community now means content producers and creators

590
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:50,680
And I'm actually very happy with that there's a controversy brewing right now around pod tech pod tech is a

591
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,680
A podcast a technology podcast network led by John Furrier

592
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,680
And so they have a couple of interesting and famous

593
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:14,680
People on the network so their talent includes Robert Scobel and Jason Calacanis although I think he has his deal was to put a couple of kids through school

594
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:21,680
I wonder if they've actually done that I wouldn't mind an update on it because they did use that we're abused that deal for

595
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,680
You know, for some nonprofit goals so an update would be nice Jason

596
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,680
So here's what happened apparently I think pod tech organized the vloggies

597
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,680
Not a horrible name

598
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:47,680
And the vloggies like an award show for vloggers and vloggers is a little bit different than the stuff that we do vloggers is in my mind is much more

599
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,680
I'm sitting in front of the camera I'm telling you a personal story a segment in time

600
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,680
But it's really one person to camera that's kind of my idea of a vlog because it it already says to me this is a video blog

601
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,680
So I'm cool with that

602
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:06,680
So they sponsored the or they organized I think even maybe the vloggies and they I know they put a lot of effort into it

603
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:16,680
Just reading through a lot of the posts what happened was on some marketing material or some kind of material a picture was used by pod tech

604
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:24,680
Without permission of the author and the author then so the owner and was taken off a flicker page which of course

605
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:31,680
You know flicker and I've been there and you know I I actually went to court over someone taking a picture off a flicker and

606
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:39,680
And using it for commercial goals which was a gossip magazine and boy did they use I mean just Google that or maybe I'll put a link in the show notes

607
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,680
You can see what that was about but actually went to court and proved that the magazine was in the wrong

608
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:51,680
I didn't get any compensation for the use of the pictures but the court basically said hey it was clearly licensed creative comments attribution

609
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,680
Non-commercial you broke the rules

610
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,680
That was bad you can't do it again because then you'll be penalized

611
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,680
So that was a huge win and I believe in that and I think I was right and I think it is right and that's the way it should be

612
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,680
But now what what we're seeing happen

613
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,680
So pod tech use this picture the owner said hey you use my picture

614
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,680
I actually this is what I do for a living or even if I did it for hobby doesn't make any difference

615
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,680
I think you should pay me I think $3,000 is about right and so they went back and forth on money

616
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,680
And you know then this thing started to spiral

617
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:34,680
So you know people are blogging about it and now pod tech is is the evil bastard who don't give a shit about people's rights

618
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:44,680
Their ownership of content and clearly don't care about content creators and they're being equated now to you know to other companies

619
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:51,680
And it's it's just so interesting to me so first of all pod tech they're they're no better or worse than we are

620
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,680
There are small companies. I'm sure they're fucked up and they fucked this up

621
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:59,680
So they need to apologize work it out with a guy and move on and stop fucking blogging about it

622
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,680
You know it's a mistake I could see it's a mistake and I really want to take their side on this

623
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:13,680
So it doesn't spin out a control because you know I pod show knows what it's like to be on the receiving end of that type of controversy

624
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,680
And a number of people are very skilled and used to it

625
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,680
So this is going to be different for this company and it's going to be interesting to watch

626
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,680
But my recommendation is you know look we're really fucking sorry

627
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,680
I think it apology was already made

628
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,680
We're really fucking sorry we'll work this out work it out with the guy and move on because you messed up. It's that simple

629
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,680
But what's so interesting to me is that here again

630
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:44,680
You see a huge controversy brewing and people yelling and shouting and calling people names

631
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:49,680
Well meanwhile there are other companies out there who are really stealing your content

632
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,680
And if you don't think you do business one of them then you're nuts

633
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,680
Okay, if you just want to post your cell phone video up somewhere and shooting a bottle rocket out of your ass

634
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,680
Great fantastic if you actually want to make a business out of it

635
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,680
Okay, you know then you're going to probably want to work with companies like pod show like pod tech

636
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,680
There are others you're probably going to want to do that. These are media companies and they're not perfect

637
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,680
We're building an industry while building companies at the same time. It's very hard

638
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,680
So let's you know we all look like idiots

639
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:30,680
Okay, let's just get it fixed move on and and I'm looking at scobl and furrier you guys should just do that because it doesn't do anyone any good

640
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:37,680
Yeah, cranky 45 minutes. I wonder if you're still even listening to me at this point

641
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:45,680
Okay, so I will I'm going to finalize with something about the channel something about our big meeting on Friday

642
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,680
The company wide meeting and changes you'll be seeing to pod show across the board

643
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:56,680
But first one more comment about the channels and this is from a technology perspective the person who sent who called this in

644
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,680
Is an engineer and a technologist so I'm hoping that you don't get bored by it

645
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,680
But you may actually be very excited when you hear his analogy

646
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:12,680
Hey, and this is a Chris Thompson in Philadelphia a humble listener calling into a use of feedback on the

647
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:20,680
Mods or channels now when you say channel I hear a feed because that's what it is you know the end pump on the output

648
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,680
So it comes to me in iTunes or whatever as a feed

649
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,680
So I'm going to you know I use some different ways I use feeds

650
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,680
I'm subscribed to this blog called gizmodo is a gadget blog

651
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:40,680
And they have a bunch of junk in there about cell phones and windows vista that just I don't care to read

652
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,680
And so I use Yahoo pipes to filter it out

653
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:52,680
Yeah, who price this pretty cool service where you can mix and mash up different RSS feeds and make your own

654
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:58,680
Output and I subscribe to that in Google reader and I get all that I want without the stuff that I don't

655
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:05,680
And in Google reader whenever I'm viewing whatever I'm viewing a an article that I want to share

656
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,680
There's a button down there that you know click on it and it is

657
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,680
Hello, I'm just going to stop you for one second. I'll show you one that a little bit

658
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,680
Okay, so the filtering fantastic. I love it

659
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:26,680
So this is exactly what we want to do with channels a couple different ways to filter one will be the order in which things come in

660
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:33,680
So you'll be able that is in my mind a type of filter so you can determine what the output's going to be what is going to poop out of that thing first

661
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:45,680
You'll be able to determine that the second thing is the depth how many items do you I'll just talk in in geek speak how many items do you want to receive from from this feed

662
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,680
So you'll be able to set that depth of one will be default actually

663
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,680
I think that's what we're well, that's what we're working with right now. You should be able to go to infinity I think

664
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:03,680
But zero will also be possible so you could suppress the output from from a show into a channel

665
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:11,680
What would be fucking awesome and there's two parts to it one is a filter where you can say okay keywords and show notes

666
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:17,680
If the pot if those pop up or tags then then don't pass the episode through that would totally work

667
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:28,680
Something also very interesting is the result of a search that could also be in a collection an item or a container I should say within a channel

668
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:38,680
So anytime a show comes through and and of course, you know, we're obviously thinking of indexing the content of the show as well

669
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:44,680
There's a lot of companies that do that extremely well and we're in touch with the number of them and we're definitely plowing ahead with that

670
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,680
So you can get some more, you know, great search essentially but the results of that search would also result in episodes

671
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:56,680
Which you could again filter saying okay if it's if it's if it matches the result but it has Microsoft in it

672
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:05,680
And I don't want it then you know filter that one out so you could really create a basically a chain or indeed a pipe if you will of the output

673
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:12,680
Love the idea definitely going to be implemented the hard part of course is how do you make that simple for people to understand

674
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,680
Then how do you build the right user interface around it but love that idea

675
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:23,680
I'm viewing a an article that I want to share there's a button down there that you know click on and it is

676
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,680
It's a share button and it goes into its own feed and that feed is a

677
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:33,680
Subscribe to buy my girlfriend's out and she uses blog lines and she's described with that so when I share something

678
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,680
It'll show up in her feed reader. That's a whole wonderful, you know, so basically something and come from Gizmoto

679
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:48,680
Go to Gapu pipes and at my Google reader get a shared and come out on her blog line at the end

680
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,680
Oh man, I love it you're thinking my thoughts

681
00:49:53,680 --> 00:50:02,680
Okay, so so this is beautiful this of course already works with pod show and if you go to my channels and yes, there's a link or all over the place now

682
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:11,680
You'll see there's a channel called Pat's podcasts and these are shows that I put together for Patricia and the way it works

683
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,680
It's a channel that I put together for Patricia the way it works is her iTunes because she has no idea

684
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:23,680
Okay, she's a no idea. I don't want to have works. She, you know, she just wants to be able to see the shit that she likes that she's found so far

685
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:30,680
So I am actually managing that experience for her since I'm always looking at video. I'm always finding stuff and audio as well

686
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,680
She loves the Frank truth as an example in fact

687
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,680
There's a special show that is only for her that an a special feed

688
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:44,680
The brine knows put together so when when something comes through on that I drop it into her feed

689
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:49,680
The other shows coming automatically Marie Claire. There's a fashion show and when there's a single episode

690
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,680
I really wanted to see I put that through and so all she has to do is just whenever she's in the mood she just checks iTunes

691
00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:00,680
And she'll see the stuff that I put into her channel and it went straight to her iTunes. It's like magic

692
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:10,680
So what we'll listen to the last minute of your comment here, but of course what we're really seeing is we've got all this stuff working

693
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,680
We can and by the way, so you send certain stories to Val to your girlfriend

694
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,680
Fantastic. So what if you set put that into the channel right?

695
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,680
But then I put the output of that channel which she normally reads on our blog lines

696
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,680
What if I put that into into one of my channels?

697
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,680
So now all of a sudden when you put something through not only does it go into Val's blog lines

698
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:38,680
It could actually bubble up into my channel which I may in turn put into Patricia's channel

699
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:44,680
Do you see the connection? Do you see the plumbing taking place? Do you see how that kind of distribution can be massive?

700
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:49,680
Because you can subscribe to channel so anyone can subscribe to the channel

701
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,680
And if you don't like one particular show that's in the channel then just suppress the output or maybe filter it out

702
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,680
That is exactly the vision. That's a very very big part of where we're going

703
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,680
So that's the interesting

704
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:07,680
No, I tend to use the individual seeds to subscribe to different podcasts

705
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:14,680
So I have individual seeds for dawn and through and and then cops master feed with all the stuff that he does in it

706
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,680
Because I like to see all the individual shows in iTunes

707
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:23,680
I don't like how a whole channel just have one big listing full of stuff

708
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,680
That can be useful sometimes

709
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,680
As it is I have one channel which contains your show

710
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:40,680
And also an awesome audio book that I know Mike Bartlett is starting in electricity

711
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,680
You can search for Mike Bartlett or electricity

712
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,680
It's a new audio pod novel he's on chapter 3

713
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,680
It's pretty awesome to talk that up

714
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:56,680
So that's the sum of the ways that I use feeds in my general media consumption

715
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,680
And hopefully that helped out. I'm going to go finish up the stuff listed right now

716
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,680
So keep up the good work. Peace

717
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,680
Oh man, do I appreciate that

718
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,680
So here's what I envision happening

719
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,680
You would have found so you've you have created a channel

720
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,680
And this channel you use for yourself, but it's also public

721
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,680
So it's very thinkable that if you're finding great audio books

722
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,680
Mark Yoshimoto Nemkoff might subscribe to your channel

723
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,680
Because he's collecting great audio books

724
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,680
And that would be the Mark great audio book channel

725
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,680
So why wouldn't I subscribe to that channel and put it in one of my own channels

726
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,680
So whenever you post a great new book that you found audio book

727
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,680
It'll automatically flow through to Mark

728
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,680
Which will automatically flow through to me and anyone else who subscribed to my channel

729
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,680
It'll flow through to them

730
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,680
Mm-hmm

731
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,680
You start seeing how powerful it can be

732
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,680
So creating the interface for that is I just want to say

733
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,680
What I've shown in these cheddar updates is not the interface

734
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,680
This is this is sandbox stuff

735
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,680
We're just trying to admit right now

736
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,680
I just want something that works so I can create the output

737
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,680
Which I think will solve part of your problem

738
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,680
There in Philadelphia

739
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,680
Yeah, if you sit right now the output of the channel is you get a whole mess of shit

740
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,680
And there's no order to it

741
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,680
There's no format is what I'd call it

742
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,680
Because you're getting all the episodes

743
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,680
You know until some certain amount of time or certain number of episodes

744
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,680
Which I think is quite set quite large

745
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,680
So that is exactly what you don't want

746
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,680
You want your channels to be clean

747
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,680
And you want them to be easy, navigable

748
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,680
You want to be able to follow the tree

749
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,680
So where did the show actually come from?

750
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,680
Ah, it came from Mark's channel

751
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,680
And oh, I see that Mark doesn't have it in his channel

752
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,680
It's actually from your channel

753
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,680
And then I could traverse your channel

754
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,680
And maybe find other stuff

755
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,680
It's really what we need

756
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,680
Okay, and this is the final thing I'm going to say about it

757
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,680
Remember I said that pod show built its site upside down

758
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,680
We need a better media browser

759
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,680
And I would love if you have any examples

760
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,680
For you to send me links

761
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,680
I'd love to see what kind of media browsers you're thinking of

762
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,680
Because when I say media browser it's essentially a player

763
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,680
Show me a player that is really thinking the way media things

764
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,680
Okay, how can we integrate what I just talked about

765
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,680
Into windows media player

766
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,680
I don't think you can

767
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,680
How do you integrate that into iTunes

768
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,680
I don't think you can

769
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,680
So the tools we really have

770
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:27,680
I don't think we're powerful enough to produce a new downloadable player

771
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,680
You know, that's huge, huge amount of work

772
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,680
But we may be able to create a similar experience online

773
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,680
Through a website, through a combination of

774
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,680
Very, very powerful technologies

775
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,680
Okay

776
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,680
Holy, cranky!

777
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,680
It's been the while since I've done over 55 minutes

778
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,680
We'll probably just get very close to an hour

779
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,680
And you know what I think we have a bona fide hit on our hands

780
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,680
This is our Jones

781
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,680
His second release to the pod safe music network

782
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,680
It's getting tons of pod play

783
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,680
And I gotta say I like it

784
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,680
Revolution of the heart

785
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,680
For people around the world

786
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,680
I don't feel an easy man

787
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,680
About the future

788
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,680
Time to end the war

789
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,680
Against humanity

790
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,680
It's time to build the peace

791
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,680
We're all essential

792
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,680
We took a little revolution

793
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,680
And demolition of the world

794
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,680
It's been the while since I've done over 55 minutes

795
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:49,680
We'll probably just get very close to an hour

796
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,680
So what you can be

797
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,680
Over and over

798
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,680
It's been the while since I've done over 55 minutes

799
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,680
We'll probably just get very close to an hour

800
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:17,680
And you know what I think we have a bona fide hit on

801
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,680
But people around the world

802
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,680
I don't feel any easy man

803
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,680
About the future

804
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:33,680
The world fills the universe

805
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,680
Without exception

806
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,680
From a spec of dust

807
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,680
To forget it seems right that doubt too

808
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,680
The hearts of you and me

809
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,680
We're talking about a revolution

810
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,680
The world fills the universe

811
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,680
Without exception

812
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,680
From a spec of dust

813
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,680
To forget it seems right that doubt too

814
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,680
The hearts of you and me

815
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,680
We're talking about a revolution

816
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,680
To forget it seems right that doubt too

817
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:29,680
The world fills the universe

818
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,680
To forget it seems right that doubt too

819
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,680
The world fills the universe

820
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,680
To forget it seems right that doubt too

821
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,680
The world fills the universe

822
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,680
As something about a man, song just for words

823
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,680
And I love the fact that it has an ending in that nice

824
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,680
Lots of stuff to do is going to be another late late night for two reasons

825
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,680
One I have a date with my daughter, we're going out and I'm very excited about it

826
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,680
We're going to the Justin Timberlake concert at the Millennium Dome

827
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,680
Or the O2 venue, formerly known as the Millennium Dome

828
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,680
In London never been there before

829
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,680
So I have to say very excited

830
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,680
And these tickets came to me from RB

831
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,680
That's right because that's what we call them in the upper class program

832
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,680
We call them Richard Branson

833
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,680
These guys know how to suck up

834
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,680
Damn I love that

835
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,680
So thanks to Pauline and Morag who are

836
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,680
I got like personal people who I book my travel through man

837
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,680
This is awesome

838
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,680
That'll be fun

839
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,680
And I was actually surprised

840
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,680
When they offered the tickets I said let me just check

841
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,680
I had to check first to see

842
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,680
Well really if Christina would be interested at all

843
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,680
Because Justin Timberlake

844
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,680
She's in a lot harder stuff typically

845
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,680
But she was really excited

846
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,680
She's like oh, we're dressing my going to wear

847
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,680
It's great, I'm going on a date with my daughter

848
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,680
It's going to be a lot of fun

849
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,680
And tomorrow of course we'll have massive food barners

850
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,680
It's going to be a great day for myself personally

851
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,680
Because of the stuff we're doing with our company

852
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,680
And of course for you guys I hope as well

853
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,680
If only just because it's the weekend

854
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,680
