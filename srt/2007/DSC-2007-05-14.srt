1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
You know, Adam, you may say that the DSC 600 is no big milestone, it's just another

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,440
hundred shows, just another show.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,640
But something about the double zeroes on the end of the show number has to at least make

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,760
you a little reflective about all the great quality times on the show.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,840
Pump that, that's like that bad boy up and down.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,320
You pump it, you pump it, you pump it, you pump it, and then all of a sudden it becomes

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,200
frothy or the openness that the show gives.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
That's so sad.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,520
Anyone can suck off my pipe any time or just the fine production that can inspire us all.

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:40,240
Yeah, I was wondering if you can always understand, because sometimes it sounds a little

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,880
rough, but anyway, as far as I know, I'm in pocket, we're going to finalize plans.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,280
I think I just might go, I don't know if I should go next week because next week is kind

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,320
of like, you know, I'm just not sure, I have half of mine, I have no idea why I said

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
that.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,680
I'm spacing out a little bit today and all of a sudden that sounds like a really good

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
idea.

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm an exciting idea.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,160
And the only people who make out are the artists, awesome, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,880
I think it, um, okay, so we should probably, all right, I got to think about this.

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,000
You already here, I'm getting diarrhea of the mouth.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Well, Adam, keep up the diarrhea of the mouth for another thousand episodes, but congrats

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
on DSC 600.

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

24
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:48,600
baby baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby baby baby, baby, baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby baby, baby baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. baby, baby baby, baby, baby baby, baby baby, baby, baby baby, baby baby, baby baby, baby baby, baby baby, baby, baby, baby baby baby, baby baby baby,

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I know, I know you miss all the sun

26
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Wherever it is, what will you remember?

27
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
You should fall short of your shine

28
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Remember life holds me one guarantee

29
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
You always have made

30
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
And if you should miss my love

31
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
One of these old days

32
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
If you should never miss the arms

33
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
And if the whole is so close

34
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,600
All the lens that used to touch your so tender

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Just remember

36
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
What I told you the day I set you free

37
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Keep me, keep me from you

38
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
That's right baby

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Ain't no mountain high enough

40
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Ain't no river wide enough

41
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Ain't no bandwidth in enough

42
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
To keep me from you

43
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Daily source code episode number 600

44
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I didn't want to make any big deal out of it

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
But you guys have sent in an array of stuff that I feel obliged to play

46
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
And kick it off today with a mashup from DJBC

47
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Ain't no misty mountain

48
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
That's a mashup of diner awesome

49
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Ain't no mountain high enough

50
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Ain't no thank you from Led Zeppelin

51
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I've been following the whole mashup culture for several years now

52
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
And I've been looking at all the jurisprudence

53
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Et cetera

54
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
And I just got to say you can't sell them

55
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
You can't put them on the pod save music now

56
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
But damn I love the mashups

57
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
I think they've just got to be okay for the Charlie

58
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
So just a little way of celebrating today

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Dad, did you want some introduction for the Daily source code?

60
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Yes, I did

61
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Did you do number 400?

62
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Yes, I did

63
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
These things

64
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
I don't know

65
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Well, what you do?

66
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Number 600

67
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
I don't know, let's find out

68
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Don't just hear away

69
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Charlie

70
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
600

71
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
This is the Daily source code

72
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Number 600

73
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Wow, that sounded good

74
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Yeah, I liked it

75
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Our green thing from New York

76
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Thank you so much, my friend

77
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Hey, whether it's shitty today

78
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
And it's been crapped throughout the entire weekend

79
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Which is a major bummer

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Because this weekend

81
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
And I was tired, man

82
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
We had a long week, a lot of stuff

83
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
And London, a lot of moving back

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
And forth amongst the masses

85
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
You know, commuting can make your tired

86
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Of course, it did give me a fantastic opportunity

87
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
to catch up on a couple shows

88
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
I just hadn't had time to listen to yet

89
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
But my big plan this weekend

90
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
And now that I've done that

91
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Severe wind shear channel crossing

92
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
It's like I want to go

93
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Cross the channel, go to Antwerp, go see the wind commander

94
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I also borrowed one of his heads

95
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Can you believe that I have this

96
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,600
You know, we use these Dave Clark headsets in aviation

97
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
In general, of course, there's lots of

98
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
You know, there's bows

99
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,600
And you know, all the major manufacturers have a headset

100
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,600
But you know, it's the Dave Clark

101
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
You got to have the green headset

102
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,600
You know, that's what proper airmen we use

103
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,600
And I had one that was only, I don't know

104
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Year and a half old

105
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
And I thought that there was something wrong with the avionics

106
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
After the annual inspection that they had

107
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Tweeted knob, left or right the wrong way

108
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
It sounded over modulated, sounded like crap

109
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,600
And I was actually having a little tough time

110
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Hearing the ATC controllers

111
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Turns out my headphone had been blown up

112
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
I don't know that happened

113
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
I know I'd like to keep him loud

114
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
But it burst so I borrowed the wind commander's headset

115
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
And of course he wants it back

116
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
So I figured, what better excuse

117
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Than to go flying than to bring the headset back

118
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
So it was crap crap, crap weather

119
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
I would have not been fun at the end of the day

120
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Of course, doable, but we would have had the same similar situation

121
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
To the severe wind cheer from past week

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
So I wasn't really looking forward to it

123
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
And so what does every pilot do

124
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
On a day when the weather shitty

125
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
You can't fly, you are all ready to go

126
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Of course, we go visit the pilot shop

127
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Let me tell you, I bought some goodies

128
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
I treated myself

129
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Kind of an advance of episode number 600

130
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
I got a life raft

131
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
I've always wanted one

132
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
And I finally saw one that only weighs 12 kilos

133
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
The problem of course with these things is

134
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
They take up room and weight

135
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
And normally they're twice the weight

136
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
So this is great for the lady Patricia

137
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Because I know last more than a minute and a half

138
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
If we have to ditch in the North Sea

139
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,600
So we'll have a nice little four person buoyancy raft

140
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,600
I bought a new life jacket for myself

141
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
A really spiffy one with it's really thin

142
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
And it's not yellow on the outside

143
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Only when you deploy it so it doesn't look like a dick walking around in it

144
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
And it's just much less in the way of the flying

145
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I got myself a transceiver

146
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,600
With VOR navigation capability

147
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
I know I needed one of those

148
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Because if you have an electrical failure, you can't communicate with the ground

149
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
And by the way

150
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
It's really small, it's in the north of the icon

151
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
I'm considering

152
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Being really bad

153
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
And taking this with me on my next flight

154
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
To the states

155
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Kind of put it in my bag

156
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
I got a lot of electronic shit in my bag anyway

157
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
So I could probably get it through the

158
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Get it through the scanner

159
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,600
And then I have an adapter so I can plug my headphones into it

160
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
I could just follow the entire flight

161
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Follow the whole cockpit

162
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
If I get on frequency at the right time in the beginning

163
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Of course you got to get on the ground frequency

164
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
To hear all the frequencies there being relay

165
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
To your flight otherwise you lose it

166
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
And then you can't

167
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
To track the frequency that they're supposed to be on

168
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I was thinking of doing that

169
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Also but the coolest thing I got

170
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
It's relatively new

171
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
You have electronic knee pads in aviation

172
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
So instead of carrying

173
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Well you're still going to carry your maps

174
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
But your maps, your approach plates

175
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Your frequency listings

176
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,600
It's all inside this nice moving map

177
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
It's got to be 20 centimeters on length

178
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I think 18 centimeters probably

179
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
You strap it to your knee

180
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
It can even you can even tie it into the auto pilot

181
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
It has a approach mode

182
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,600
I mean just a fantastic, fantastic navigational aid

183
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Which you could also see is

184
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
The fucking toy

185
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
At a good time with it

186
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Inside the fucking view

187
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Hey Adam, this is Tom from the fog view podcast

188
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
And last Friday when I introduced the carry cutting him song

189
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,600
I must have been having a football Friday because I messed up

190
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,600
And I attributed this theme song to the great Greg Smith

191
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
When you know I meant the great Jeff Smith

192
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
I'm sorry Jeff

193
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
But you can check his workout at

194
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
TheJefSmith.com

195
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
That's the GEOFFSmith.com

196
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Also Adam, congratulations on show number 600

197
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Thank you my friend.

198
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Take care. Thanks.

199
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Yeah, I caught that actually, but for some reason

200
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
I guess it was a whole song after it

201
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
And I just forgot to go back and correct you on that

202
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Because that was kind of weird.

203
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
You got a jingle by the famous Jeff Smith

204
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
And still I deed him as the famous Greg Smith

205
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Something different to sure

206
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
You got all Jeff's back.

207
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
You upload another song to the pop safe music network

208
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I can identify

209
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
If this geek rule the world

210
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Attitude last night

211
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I was the king in second life

212
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
I was the master of as far as I could see

213
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,600
And as I looked around the place

214
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
I saw the look on my own face

215
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Staring through my 24-inch screen

216
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,600
I thought I'd like to run the whole world

217
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
From my desktop

218
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Be the head of time show and quit my major job

219
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600

Attitude last night

247
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
It's been a year, like 24,000 friends

248
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Oh my space, probably gonna never get

249
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Lookin' my face to another crazy little thing

250
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
You thought I'd never do it

251
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Keep messaging to do the bit but you're full

252
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
You wanna follow my Twitter, oh no

253
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Got in my P.I.S. but no, I know

254
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
You'll be answer for head, miss what I said

255
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Could true up to leak your dead

256
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Sneak it through the back, no

257
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
I'm gonna get more ram on the man

258
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Had it like I'm on the floor, snap

259
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Took a video video, put it up on YouTube, dig it over

260
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Put a P.H.P.S, forget it, go, little time bomb

261
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Mother, what a school, nothing coming up

262
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Push up, pull, hey, let's party

263
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Bad hard guys, pull

264
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,600
The more I think about being king of the castle

265
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
The more it sounds dumb

266
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Had a whole lot of hassle

267
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
I'd drop me and make a mess

268
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
And watch it all go down

269
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Another bubble purse before it hits the ground

270
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
If this key cruel the world

271
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I get my instant message hurt

272
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
By everyone who shot the bird

273
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
And call me crazy

274
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
This key cruel the world

275
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
I finally get myself a girl

276
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,600
And get a life and move out of my brother's basement

277
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Oh no, if this key cruel the world

278
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
I'd screw it up and later

279
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Don't need to know

280
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
I never do it, not again

281
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
This key cruel the world

282
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
You think I ever get a girl

283
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Get a life and move right back

284
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
In my brother's basement

285
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Oh no, if I'm on the ground

286
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Oh no, if I'm on the ground

287
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Oh no, if I'm on the ground

288
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Oh no

289
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
Taking it on this afternoon

290
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Just about to board a flight to Kuwait

291
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Just wanted to wish you congratulations on

292
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600

I got to tell you I do subscribe to unwind

And it's on those train rides

329
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
To shortage

330
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
And back when I listen to shows

331
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Like that

332
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
And sometimes listen to it on the plane

333
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
And I'm just like

334
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,600
I just fall asleep

335
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
But it's great

336
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Listening to the solstery

337
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Dulse at Tones of Angie B

338

And let me see

339
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Coming up this week

340
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Now Saturday

341
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
I'm going to be traveling to New York

342
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Sunday traveling to Austin

343
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
For the big eye media conference

344
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Which is basically a conference of

345
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Advertisers and particularly buyers of advertising

346
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
So you can understand the importance of that

347
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Some things never change

348
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Let me tell you when it comes to sales

349
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
You still got to do the hand job

350
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
And I have no problem with that

351
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
So before that

352
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Now we do have some advanced lined up for this week

353
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I also intend to find a day

354
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
It's probably going to be Thursday

355
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Perhaps even Friday

356
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
When I will do the Antwerp trip

357
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
According to that one

358
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Both to Antwerp and back

359
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
And of course I'll cut that down to size

360
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
And we'll have a trip together

361
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
I'll just talk about what the fuck I'm doing

362
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Hopefully

363
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Just like if I were flying with someone else

364
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
It'll be you

365
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
And me

366
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
And a couple hundred thousand of our best friends

367
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
And I also have a feeling that we'll be talking to

368
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Some other savants in the area of mobile phones

369
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
After you hear this comment

370
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Hi Adam

371
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
It's Sam here from London

372
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
You tell me

373
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
I usually only phone you to men

374
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm stoned to breaks like them

375
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I'll receive right here

376
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Okay

377
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
I had no idea what you just said

378
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
But you're calling, I appreciate it

379
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Hey

380
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I won't be advised to do any of your servants

381
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
I'm offended mine

382
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Finally last week

383
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
On early on Thursday morning

384
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
To recount a bit of a horrifying story

385
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
She was working at 23 am

386
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
When you're seeing your bang

387
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
And a bedroom which sort of the concrete smoke

388
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,600
So the first thing she wanted to do was call the fire brigade

389
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
So she went to pick up her phone

390
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
But her phone was in two bits

391
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
And the battery was missing

392
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
So she panicked

393
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
She thought someone was in her house

394
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
So ran for the nearest phone box

395
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Fortunately when she got there

396
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,600
There were police about on the street at night

397
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
So she grabbed one of the police officers

398
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
And said, look, there might be someone in my house

399
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
The house might be on fire

400
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
And stuff for ringing your help

401
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
The police went back to the house

402
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Fortunately the fire hadn't gone

403
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
The smoke could clear

404
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
And you confirmed that there was nobody in our house

405
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
But on investigation

406
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
They found the mobile phone battery

407
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
And it's not here mobile phone battery

408
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
It had shot

409
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
From her mobile phone across the side of the room

410
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
And underneath the wardrobe

411
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
And said itself on fire

412
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Well, well, well, well, well

413
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
I've heard of this happening with laptop batteries

414
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
I've heard of it

415
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Happening with some cell phones in the US

416
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
I thought mainly

417
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
I thought it was only motor rollers

418
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
But you're telling me it's shot across the room

419
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
And said itself on fire

420
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
This is

421
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Those Nokia guys man

422
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
They think of everything don't they?

423
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
There's a pretty much just a molten lamp

424
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
A metal underneath the wardrobe

425
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
And it sets fire to the car

426
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
And also it's a stuff that fortunately

427
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
The fire didn't spread any further

428
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Now my friend had only gone to bed

429
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
I'd want to clock in the morning

430
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
And put the phone on charge

431
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Just before she went to sleep

432
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,600
And so whatever it happened

433
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
The thing that seems to have happened

434
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
was that the somehow

435
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
The mobile phone

436
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Or the battery exploded

437
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Left to shaft at the phone

438
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
And shot across the side of the room

439
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Now it's something that's probably traveled about

440
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
7 foot and then set fire to itself

441
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Now this is pretty dangerous

442
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
It's Nokia phones can do this

443
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
If you just leave them on charge on their own

444
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,600
I mean it was an original Nokia phone

445
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
With an original charge on an original battery

446
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Now hi, okay

447
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Hmm

448
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Original phone

449
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Of course, I presume

450
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Original charge or original battery

451
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
And this is not just a threat to everyone's home

452
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
I mean I can imagine that happening upstairs

453
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,600
In the attic which is the complete wood floor

454
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Would burn like an MF

455
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,600
But it's also a matter of national security

456
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
How can we take these dangerous cell phones on airplanes with us?

457
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
This has to stop what is going on

458
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Right

459
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Now she's wondering what to do

460
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
She's called Nokia and they'd say

461
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Let me guess

462
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Why don't you send it to us?

463
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Send her the phone

464
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Yeah

465
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,600
I'm just wondering if your answer wants to go inside of the device

466
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I mean you know

467
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
She'd go and get compensation for the damage it caused to our house

468
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
But it could have been so much nasty

469
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I mean people could have died

470
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
No, a homeless I can hold on

471
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
So first of all the compensation to our house

472
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
She should be insured for that

473
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
And I don't necessarily want to

474
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
I hate lawsuits

475
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
I hate it

476
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
So don't do that

477
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
I'm sure that Nokia has a reasonable explanation

478
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,600
And if not I'm sure that just like any other company that's had these issues

479
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
They'll dive into it immediately because of course no one wants that

480
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,600
I don't think the way to go is to contact Nokia

481
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Well, no I take that back

482
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Yes, you should send the damage product to them

483
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Only after you write up the story and take numerous pictures

484
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,600
And you show the situation of the bedroom and how far it's shot

485
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
And all that and then give that to someone like a gadget or something

486
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Because if there truly is a problem that will put pressure on all cell phone manufacturers

487
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,600
To revisit the issue because it will come from a wider sharing of audience

488
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,600
And we'll all be thinking about this

489
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,600
But again, I'm not into

490
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Let's go kill the corporate beast because they're making dangerous shit

491
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
I mean this needs to be investigated

492
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
In fact, you might even want to send it to

493
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,600
The gizmodo or in gadget guys to have them take a look at it

494
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Maybe they can make some sense out of it before you send it to Nokia

495
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,600
But it does have to go to Nokia because without these important data points that your friend has

496
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,600
About what happened, you know, they'll never be able to improve anything

497
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Or start any type of investigation themselves

498
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Result of this

499
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,600
So I'm just wondering if CSB or anyone like that's got any advice on how she should approach Nokia with this

500
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,600
And I don't know if this is the kind of thing that you want to go public with

501
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,600
But I still do it was an interesting story and it makes me personally amazing before I put my Nokia phone on charge

502
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,600
So that's about it for now

503
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,600
I'm a folder, I love the show, keep it up, it's great

504
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
I love all the advanced stuff, it's fantastic

505
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,600
So yeah, and then you guys got some advice and it's compacting me on it

506
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
That'd be great, cheers

507
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
All right, buddy, cheers

508
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Yeah, well, the savants that come to mind are of course comic strip blogger

509
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
I'm sure he'll be sending in something

510
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,600
And depending on how happy

511
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:15,600
And if you can speak for the company, I'll ask Candyman Luke if he can give his view on it

512
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
Very interesting

513
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,600
And as a lover of the Nokia devices, I'm also a tad bit concerned

514
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Frank Jonas at me in email, I'm seeing this more and more podcast

515
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Let artists pay them money via sonic bids

516
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
So they get played on their shows

517
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Here's an example of how I'll show with unproven audience

518
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,600
One several artists over by charging them for plays

519
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
If anything, these shows should be ashamed of themselves

520
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
That's like charging for show content

521
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,600
This is beyond wrong and puts podcasting in a really bad light

522
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Let me just take a look at the link that you provided here, sonic bids

523
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
What pops up here?

524
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Area 67 plays music from unsigned and undiscovered artists

525
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Looking for exposure and all genres are accepted and played

526
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,600
They will have guests on the show to discuss the music and also to review what is playing

527
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Guess what also talk about new equipment out as well as discuss music business

528
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Topics, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

529
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Okay

530
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Congratulations to the following sonic bids artist that we're selected

531
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,600
And how does this work? I don't see anywhere

532
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
I don't see oh

533
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
I don't get it

534
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,600
So how do you, how do you buy airplay?

535
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Let me see

536
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,600
I don't understand how this works.

537
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Okay, so I'm just going to presume that what you're saying is true.

538
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Let me tell you about the Podsafe music license.

539
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Ron and I thought about this for a very long time.

540
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,600
And the idea of payola, which, of course, is illegal in the United States, is a horrible thing,

541
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,600
because there is only money that can buy preference in a limited resource.

542
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,600
And a limited resource would be public airways.

543
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
And so anything that is limited, so that would include satellite.

544
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,600
But when it comes to the internet, I don't see a problem.

545
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
I really don't.

546
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,600
If a show wants to charge artists for being played, so be it.

547
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,600
That could be their business model if they have enough audience.

548
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,600
But audience is not stupid.

549
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Especially if they're posting it on Sonic Bids.

550
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Yeah, that seems pretty obvious what they're doing.

551
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,600
But the same token, you know, the could be a show that will promote an artist's entire album.

552
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,600
If they want to take cash for it, that's fine, because it's not a limited resource.

553
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
You don't need money to get podplay.

554
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
You just don't.

555
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,600
You can create your own show and create podplay.

556
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,600
So I disagree with what you're saying there.

557
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,600
And we thought about this for quite a while that that should be totally an option.

558
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,600
You don't want to be able to charge whatever they want for whatever they want in their show.

559
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I don't think we should put the traditional restrictions on it because let me say it's not traditional media.

560
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
And it definitely is not a limited resource.

561
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
I'm sure I'm going to get some feedback on that.

562
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Hey Adam Curry, this is Carmen Tyler from the Carmen cast.

563
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,600
So, 600th episode, huh?

564
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
That is amazing.

565
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,600
You know, I know that call you be podfather, which you are.

566
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,600
But on 600 podcasts, I think that makes you the pod king.

567
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:43,600
So, your majesty, congratulations on your 600 podcast of the daily source code.

568
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Oh, yes.

569
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Carmen, I shall make you my queen.

570
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
She lives in Los Angeles now.

571
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Next time I'm in town for more than three hours.

572
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
I'm going to look her up.

573
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Ah, Carmen.

574
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
But don't call me the king.

575
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Just call me the Sultan of the Savans.

576
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Hi there Adam.

577
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
It's Kevin Crossman from fratac.cast.com.

578
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Just wanted to give you some feedback that I thought you did a great job trying to hang in there

579
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,600
in your interview with Tom extra blogger.

580
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
I mean, what the fuck was the matter with Tom extra blogger?

581
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,600
I mean, interrupt you every goddamn minute.

582
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Did you even answer questions?

583
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Just kept interrupting.

584
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,600
So, what I want to do here is play a little knock-knock joke on comic strip blogger.

585
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
So, okay, you're with me, right?

586
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Knock-knock?

587
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Who's there?

588
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
Interrupting cow.

589
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
Interrupting cow.

590
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Interrupted.

591
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Talk to you later, Adam.

592
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,600
I didn't mind.

593
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
I liked it.

594
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
I thought it was pretty cool.

595
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,600
And did you notice I kept my sunglasses on throughout the entire video interview?

596
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
But it's nice.

597
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
I liked comic strip blogger has a really good point.

598
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,600
He tries to piss you off to get you angry because only then are you truthful?

599
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
At least that's his hypothesis.

600
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,600
I was truthful throughout the entire meeting.

601
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
So, and the audio stuff is pretty good.

602
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,600
I thought it was pretty in-depth questions, but just funny.

603
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,600
And it's good because there's a guy you can talk to the same way he talks to me.

604
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,600
You can talk back to him that way, so that kind of works.

605
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Let's see, coming up this week, I believe we'll be kicking off our suck less promotion.

606
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
I think you'll like that.

607
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,600
It's going to last for quite a while, but it's a way for listeners to participate, get free stuff,

608
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,600
and most importantly, help us suck less.

609
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,600
And also, maybe by the end of the week or the beginning of next week, we will be announcing

610
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,600
very interesting new addition to the Pod Show podcast network.

611
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,600
We have a well-known personality coming on to the network.

612
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,600
He'll be building several channels.

613
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
And he's already started work.

614
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,600
I just don't want to announce it yet because, well, there's no damage announcements, of course.

615
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,600
But he also requested me to hold off on it a little bit, but I'm so excited.

616
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
I think you're going to be-

617
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Well, I think a lot of the blogging world will be surprised when you find out who's coming in.

618
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
I don't know, Jim, right, there's a comment.

619
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Yeah, 10 minutes to work, and it's dinner right.

620
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Okay, a whole lot.

621
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,600
If you in the States and you can't understand what James is saying,

622
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:13,600
the final thought of the week on Friday was to do something different to challenge yourself.

623
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Even if it's a turning left when you go to work, instead of turning right to go to work,

624
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
because it challenges your brain and literally changes something in the chemical,

625
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,600
make-up, and distribution of neurons and crap.

626
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
So it's good.

627
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
It'll make you feel wonderful.

628
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
So this is his response to that.

629
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,600
He's getting a different turn off the intersection, as you would see.

630
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
He has a good idea for your listeners.

631
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Anybody got stuck, not over there.

632
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,600
10, 10, 10 miles from here.

633
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,600
There, when you're too is your route, too short of the route.

634
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,600
And I guarantee you, if you've got any distance to go, anything will be 20 miles,

635
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,600
or 30 kilometers or over a European, you want to be hungry.

636
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,600
I guarantee you, it'll take you through some interesting minutes.

637
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
There you go.

638
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Our James.

639
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Bit.

640
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Oh, man.

641
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Don't call me from the car.

642
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
James, I can barely hear you.

643
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,600
A good point, though, if you travel to work and you have a satellite navigation system,

644
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,600
and once you start it to avoid highways or motorways,

645
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,600
and take the inside route, I guarantee you, it's going to work.

646
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,600
And while you're doing, record something, will you?

647
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Yeah.

648
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Okay.

649
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Ladies and gentlemen, the drunk Londoner is back.

650
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Oh, obviously, it's right.

651
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Bob, I'm not drunk.

652
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
I'll say, like, give me your cold.

653
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
That would happen.

654
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,600
What happened to Charles the drunk in Londoner is his, his bag was stolen.

655
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
His laptop is cell phone and his iPod.

656
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,600
So he hasn't been able to listen for the fast couple of weeks.

657
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,600
I think he's found a worthy substitute though.

658
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:54,600
He's made a very kind of it.

659
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,600
I happened to just kill.

660
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,600
I was on some random randomly strange coincidence.

661
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,600
I happened to, I sent him my computer.

662
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
The one I have at home.

663
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Not my laptop.

664
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
They were neat.

665
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
I sent my iPhone on camera.

666
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Oh, I made it.

667
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
I was just nasty.

668
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
Anyway.

669
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,600
And I just click on when he puts his downloading.

670
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,600
And he made a real kind of a mate.

671
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Yeah, no idea.

672
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
That's just me.

673
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
So much to me.

674
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Okay.

675
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Maybe not.

676
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
I just sent out your way.

677
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Think on your phone.

678
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
But that's all good.

679
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Well, let me explain.

680
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
I said on the show.

681
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,600
I said, you know, this guy's been calling in for a long time.

682
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Big fan of the show.

683
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
He's got ripped off.

684
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
I said, I got one of these red iPod.

685
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
The virgin Atlantic sent me.

686
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
I'll send that to you.

687
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
So he just received your address.

688
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
By the way, Charles.

689
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
So the iPod is on the way.

690
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
As soon as I can rip it off of the lady Patricia.

691
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
He used it for rehearsals.

692
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
When she was in the Netherlands last week.

693
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,600
So there's probably a couple of star sisters songs on it.

694
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
But you don't mind, really.

695
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,600
I'm really, really going to tell you off on it.

696
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
And then when I'm done with that nice red iPod,

697
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I'm going to alternate charity or something.

698
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
And I'll put your name over it.

699
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
That's okay.

700
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
If not, you let me know.

701
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,600
I'm never going to hear this message.

702
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Because I'm not able to listen right now.

703
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
But I'm leaving this message.

704
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,600
So that maybe you can hear something.

705
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
I'm waiting for him to go.

706
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
I love you, man.

707
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
I love you.

708
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
I love you.

709
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
I love you.

710
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Yeah.

711
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
On the same podcast.

712
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Right.

713
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
You know, maybe if I'm a fool.

714
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,600
And I was dipping in a great point of the street.

715
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
It's over there.

716
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
What do you do?

717
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,600
I'm going to land on this.

718
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
I'll be here.

719
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
We need to be messed up for you.

720
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Show them.

721
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
What the fuck are we going to do?

722
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,600
What the fuck are we going to do?

723
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

724
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Right.

725
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
You were told.

726
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Next time, you know, those commercials on television.

727
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
And if you in the UK, they have them now.

728
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Where girl goes to a party.

729
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
And then she sees herself at the party.

730
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Getting drunk and dropping stuff and falling on the floor and puking in the toilet.

731
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,600
You know, this is, this is, this is your, this is your James Charles, your brain.

732
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
This is you on drink.

733
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Can, about the green room guy and the dreams stuff.

734
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
I don't want to be in a stream.

735
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,600
All thought I'd listen to that dream podcast.

736
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
And then you make an online offer.

737
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Yeah, but I had a dream where.

738
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Oh.

739
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Please.

740
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
I don't know if I want to hear this.

741
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,600
He's talking about the dream I had about there.

742
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,600
I'm totally spacing out.

743
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Eric Bergen and his girlfriend.

744
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
It was a sexual dream.

745
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,600
I was hanging on your whole play.

746
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,600
And you flew to Switzerland.

747
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
And you were really pissed off.

748
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
I didn't hang it on the outside of the play.

749
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,600
But you really pissed off.

750
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
But you said, yeah, what doesn't matter?

751
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
And you've always loved it.

752
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
And it was nice.

753
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,600
I know that can I probably reflect upon you.

754
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
I'm making these messages.

755
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
It was like, oh, yeah.

756
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
It's all good.

757
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
It's all good.

758
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
Cool.

759
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
It's good.

760
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
So, fuck.

761
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
I'm going to regret this.

762
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
Oh, yeah.

763
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Cool.

764
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
This is Charles.

765
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
George, I'm Londoner.

766
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,600
I'm having a lovely time in London.

767
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
I like it here.

768
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
It's nice.

769
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Come visit.

770
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
And I can be your guide.

771
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
It needs our calm help.

772
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
And take you out on the town.

773
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,600
I'll give you a nice place to stay for a nice place to go.

774
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Thank you.

775
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Bye.

776
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Charles, the drunken Londoner.

777
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Please promise me you tell me exactly what you drank to reach this state of an

778
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
ebryation because there's the perfect spot.

779
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
You can replicate that.

780
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,600
You got yourself a regular spot on the show, my friend.

781
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Arthur, you're real.

782
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,600
I picked it up from the title.

783
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,600
It will become a parent throughout the lyrics.

784
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Perfect.

785
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,600
