00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
A Domain Registration is a gift that keeps on giving for all the geeks in your life.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,000
The newer shot hit GoDaddy.com.

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Listen to this podcast for a special code that you can use to get great discounts at GoDaddy.com.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In a world where big ass voice guide Don LaFontaine does the intro for the daily source code.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Most podcasters would be intimidated.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Most of them will wet their tiny little pants, being afraid to create a new intro for Adam Kirk.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But not one.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
One voice guide is ready to take on the biggest voice in the movie.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's the daily source code that Adam Kirk.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Because there's no way you can be cuter than that.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Delta Sierra Charm 5-2.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
60 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Welcome to the DSC 5-50 view.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No animals were injured when he making up his podcast.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Adam Kirk moved the hell out of some earth.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I never had much luck with girls.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They never liked to read and learn.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But I like to.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And if I could figure out the cause I know of your heart.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That be a good start.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh yes it would.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I never tried a date online.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Use everybody that's built to find.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I said that not that.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So if you look at this great.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Is there an unboss game.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You'll be my first place.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Because baby we'll be in the chat room.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
On the IOC.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll have the big prom.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Star Trek costume for me.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Time in the time zone.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Go play.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
TNT at baby.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's upnerd to me.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You know what to say.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's get a nice opening on guys.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
My face is going to set you free.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll be a fanboy.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And my star feeds you live on.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It matches the one ball.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But I never need more.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So baby we'll be in the chat room.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Time in the time zone.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Go play.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000

Be see pick up that guitar man.

54

Talk to me.

I'll have the big prom.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
On the IOC.

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Star Trek costume for you and me.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Time in the time zone.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Go play.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's upnerd to me.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You know what to say.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's upnerd to me.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's upnerd to me.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You know what to say.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You know what to say.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's upnerd to me.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It works for me.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
There's somebody out there.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's going to like that song.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The fun.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Fox drug uniform.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Talk nerdy to me.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Speaking off.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Another week on the daily source code.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Everybody how you doing.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It is Delta Sierra Charlie five five two coming to you from the curry condo.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It is Monday only just though.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's 12.45 a.m.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Back from Los Angeles.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's a very interesting time.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Of course to be in LA and in Hollywood.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
With the with the Academy Awards.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'd have to say that's the part of Hollywood.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't like that much.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Or not.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not that interested.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm just not interested in it as much as I am in.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The plumbing of Hollywood and how how stuff is put together.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You know how a movie like Seriana is is put together in package.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Great movie.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Real feel good movie.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Or how Steven Spielberg will do the new transformers.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You know, these are all amazing.

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Amazing things that go on in the back room.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And which was also why it was there.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So of course I didn't actually go to the Academy Awards.

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't get tickets to that.

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Shit.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't get you.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't even get invited to the MTV Awards anymore.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So I watched those on TV.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I got to tell you it was I like the show.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It was you know, long as as usual.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It felt even longer than usual.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Perhaps Ellen DeGeneres.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I think she did a great job.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It was a very different approach.

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You know, instead of real high tension, high comedy bits.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You know, it was almost like our TV show.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I like that.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That was that was kind of nice.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And it gave a very nice relaxed atmosphere.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And you could really tell that people there were having a good time.

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah.

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah.

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You know, I think the takeaway from me from this year's award show is I'm pretty proud

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that America is producing this stuff.

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And even more so because if you were keeping count.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And I wasn't actually keeping count.

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But how many foreigners?

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And I don't mean that in a derogatory way.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But how many foreigners?

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
One Oscars.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Through this magic making machine known as Hollywood.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I mean, that's pretty cool.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
People are coming to United States to realize their dream.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And I think there are also some darn good movies that were made.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah, it was good.

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It was nice.

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
For me, it really felt like it was much more celebration of everything that happened.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It was just my perspective this time around.

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't know.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But just, you know, the way movies are made.

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What an amazing business.

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I probably have a little bit more appreciation for it in the past year and a half or so.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We've been doing a lot of productions at Pod Show.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And I know what it takes.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You know, just to get a show like Textra up and running.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It takes a lot of people and a lot of hard work.

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And yeah, the technology has improved and it's become much more affordable and much more efficient

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
without a doubt.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But you still need people who definitely know what they're doing.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So I'm going to run out a couple of things for you.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Quick you.

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let me see.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, yeah.

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I fixed my Wi-Fi problem.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Did I tell you that?

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't think so.

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Just inability to connect in in most spots throughout the condo to the to the Wi-Fi network.

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Part of that without a doubt because there's just so many networks that I could get up here on the 24th floor.

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's outrageous.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let me see.

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I got a couple of the comments on that.

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The first one was a prolific programmer.

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Interesting.

161
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He says I see a lot of the two fire Wi-Fi access points.

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I've seen those two.

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's a number two wire.

164
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
According to a prolific programmer, those are SBC routers.

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Interesting.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So they have some kind of wireless thing as well.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I had a, I think I had some comments on this.

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
A lot of people were, you know, very helpful trying to,

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
you know, come up with ideas and solutions.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What my possible problem can be.

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And I'll tell you what I did to fix it.

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But first let's hear some of the suggestions because I thought that they might be kind of handy.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And I probably ran into one of these problems.

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Otherwise networks are you seeing where you live.

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's, that's an audio comment I wouldn't mind having.

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
In fact, all right.

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So this is sneaker paid from Amsterdam.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The Western Nouns Courts of Amsterdam, actually.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And these are the names of the networks in my neighborhood.

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
De Vries.

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We've got three speed touches with the strange extensions numbers.

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We've got one Apple network.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We've got a 06 for dreams.

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I guess that's a telephone number or something.

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We've got a lot of week.

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We've got two live boxes and one guy loving his

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
router and calling it sexy thing.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hmm.

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's kind of weird.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Anyway, these were the networks from Amsterdam.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Show Adam.

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So it turns out that there is an issue that I didn't even think of.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Having the same access name, access point name or SSID is its known.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Could of course be a tremendous issue.

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Now, it's named Curry Kondo here.

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But somewhere along the the routes of my testing,

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I know I reset it and I said, okay, screw it.

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I want all settings back to default.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And of course, then the access point gets the name default.

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, guess how many defaults there are.

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hi, Adam.

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's Martin from Reading.

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
A couple of things for you.

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're wireless network.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're having trouble with it.

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It sounds suspicious to me, although I'm not an expert.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's someone else has got a wireless network.

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And they've set it up to the same SSID as you're wireless network.

209
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And what is probably hacking is your machine is linking onto their network rather than yours.

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And the password or the security you've got set up obviously doesn't match theirs.

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And therefore, what you're getting is no IP address.

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I can't really explain that one because normally, if you get a web key conflict,

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
we'd add my web key.

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You usually get a nice address, but you don't get any traffic flowing, for example.

215
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You could try just changing your SID, changing your web key,

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
or if you're using WPA or something else.

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You could try changing that.

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And turn off any bulkcasting you're doing.

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And you might, if you could have other people's wireless networks and somebody really just

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
feel like constantly setting their wireless network to the same as yours.

221
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You might need to do this several times.

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So that makes a hell of a lot of sense to me.

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And I did see that problem quite a lot where you'd get, you'd be connected,

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
but wouldn't get an IP address.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And of course, you know, I was on default.

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I was just trying to set the whole thing up again.

227
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm just going back to the basics.

228
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But so many people don't change their access point name that they leave it in default mode.

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And I guess that was conflicting.

230
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So I figured that one out.

231
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So I changed it back to something unique, which Cody condos seemed pretty reasonable.

232
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And then I decided to download the new firmware or an updated version.

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I still had firmware from like 2004 or maybe, yeah, 2004.

234
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, whatever they changed, man, it made a big difference.

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's something I should have checked right out of the box.

236
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Sure.

237
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But this dealing box isn't that old.

238
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Only bought it maybe 8 or 9 months ago.

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So you could at least expect that they'd change that somewhere along the way.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So fixed.

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It works now.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
All my wireless devices connect.

243
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Thank you all so much for all the helpful ideas and tips that you sent in.

244
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Second thing.

245
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Totally unrelated.

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You commented the other day about people skipping over things in your show.

247
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And it's always when I'm driving along in the car.

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's always frustrated me that in my car.

249
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have to hold down the fast forward button on my stereo.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And I'm playing the MP3 file.

251
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And I have to listen to it sort of fast forwarding it.

252
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So the double or triple speed.

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And you have to just hit your finger off the button.

254
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And exactly the right point.

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Otherwise you miss what the next.

256
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So the right to miss on the show.

257
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And I noticed the other day I was listening to a podcast.

258
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Which I found on iTunes called Dom Jolly versus the planets.

259
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Now I'm not advocating this podcast because I actually listened to it.

260
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And then I think I deleted it.

261
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So if you played on the iPod as an MP4 and iTunes format file.

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
On the iPod it actually shows up as having little bookmarks in it.

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Now I'm sure maybe the rest of the world already knows about this.

264
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But this is a revelation to me because it means you can actually just by pressing the fast forward button on the iPod.

265
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Or if you got the iPod connected to some of the device like a car stereo.

266
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You can actually just by pressing the button that would normally skips the next track.

267
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And it skips the next segment.

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Now obviously simple.

269
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And there's something you probably have to publish everything on Porto in the MP4A.

270
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm not sure if you already do that.

271
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But it just struck me as something that is a really good way as navigating a what could possibly be a quite a long podcast.

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
From anybody who's publishing a podcast.

273
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So there you go.

274
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Maybe somebody out there knows more about it.

275
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And they can perhaps explain to us how it all works and how perhaps you guys could book it in.

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But I think it'd be a great idea to implement on many of your shows.

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Because it would wrap people to navigate through their shows.

278
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So I'm going to stop ramping.

279
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yes.

280
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll speak to you later.

281
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Okay.

282
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So I do want to respond to that.

283
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah.

284
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Technically that's possible.

285
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Bookmarking in the AAC format that is predominantly used on Apple iPods.

286
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
There are some different ways to bookmark with an MP3s.

287
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And I don't really want to open that discussion up because it's something that we've, you know, we've had a lot.

288
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Over the past three years.

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I really don't like bookmarking and not for if it's for the sole purpose of annotation.

290
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Or certain type of content.

291
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It makes a lot of sense.

292
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You know, if it's a speech and you want to go to a certain section in the speech and it has to be indexed.

293
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But this is not a speech.

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You know, you're not listening to me for, you know, just to pull out nuggets of information.

295
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If you are, well, tough.

296
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't want to make it easy for you to skip ahead.

297
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Now, obviously, the music, I put a lot of thought into it.

298
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't just play stuff really nearly.

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I listen, I get a lot of feedback.

300
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I get a lot of suggestions.

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There's a whole bunch of different reasons why I play stuff.

302
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And, and I really, that's the one thing I continuously am trying to adjust to keep it fresh.

303
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Keep it interesting.

304
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So we all can learn something.

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So we can enjoy something together.

306
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And, you know, a lot of people skip through the songs.

307
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But to make it easier for you to skip through topics now.

308
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'd rather you say that I'm just rambling and give me some other type of feedback.

309
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But that's just too lazy for me.

310
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
No, no.

311
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I mean, it's like, yeah, just skip around to the podcast.

312
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And by the way, it is a hell of a job to annotate that.

313
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You know, it's not like, okay, I'm finally done with the show.

314
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I've prepped it for an hour and a half.

315
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I record the show.

316
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Now, I have to go back and annotate everything.

317
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I need a full time producer for that.

318
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You have a transcription department is what they have.

319
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What they call that.

320
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't have that yet.

321
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But still, it's like, no, this is, this is my art.

322
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Please, stay with me.

323
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's really important.

324
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And you could miss a really nice gems if you fast forward through stuff.

325
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And what should we do?

326
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Just make it easier.

327
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Get bookmarking and we'll put in some technology.

328
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And I applaud that blows you.

329
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I mean, make it really easy.

330
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah, I'm just applying from Parker in Colorado.

331
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And I was just listening to DSC551 and walking out to some of the music you've played

332
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
a day, especially free ride.

333
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That was awesome.

334
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And the deafsmith, Jingle, totally made me think of it.

335
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You nailed it on there.

336
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He is so good at those.

337
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Do you have a good work?

338
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Boulder.

339
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So I was talking about this with a friend of mine.

340
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Because I really did enjoy just jamming out on Friday.

341
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That was a lot of fun.

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And I got a lot of amazing feedback when we go into some kind of musical archive

343
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and play something from 25, 30 years ago.

344
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
People really seem to love that.

345
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And so a new segment, hold on a second.

346
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't quite have the, what actually, I started on some, some imaging.

347
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's not edited yet, but you'll get the idea.

348
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let me undo the plug here because I've got to put this one into my,

349
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
hold on.

350
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I want you to actually hear the plug hold on.

351
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Here it.

352
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Okay.

353
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That means I'm actually putting this plug live.

354
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oops.

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Now you can hear it.

356
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm putting it into my first generation iPod.

357
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Do you have one of these?

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Are you like me?

359
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Are you a lazy bastard?

360
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Who doesn't manage his songs on his iPod with that?

361
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Incredibly handy interface known as iTunes?

362
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
No.

363
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What you do is you fill it up and you buy a new one or maybe if you've traveled enough on Virgin Airlines, you get one for free.

364
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And you just fill it up with more stuff.

365
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
This is the iPod that I used in 2004.

366
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah, 2004 when I was doing my, you know, the first testing with, with iPod or with my Apple script,

367
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
the first shows before they were called Daily Source Code, all kinds of material because at the time,

368
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I literally saved everything because we were working on this technology and it was initially implemented through iTunes and the iPod.

369
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So everything that I had pod caught every element, everything went on into iTunes and subsequently onto the iPod.

370
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It is a mess.

371
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It is just filled.

372
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It is, I don't know.

373
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What is this?

374
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The 20 gig I think?

375
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
One of the first gen iPods.

376
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's filled with,

377
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
God knows what.

378
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And in no particular order.

379
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But on top of that, Napster was still, you know, he had open nap and stuff running at the time.

380
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Well, what I would do is I built a little script that I could just type up a text file,

381
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
drop it into a folder and this script would go out and pull all the Napster servers.

382
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And the script, of course, would contain band names and song titles.

383
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And it would go out search things, pull them in, and then, you know, it would basically download everything that I wanted on my list.

384
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And another little piece of, it was so cool back in the day when all the shit still worked.

385
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I also had a way so that I could throw that list in and the minute it had downloaded at least a portion of one of the songs.

386
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It started to play that.

387
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And basically my playlist would just keep on going and, you know, throughout the day, maybe a type a couple more songs that I'd been thinking about,

388
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
thinking of and throw that into the folder and then those songs would magically be found and start to play eventually.

389
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So it is kind of like what Napster is today.

390
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I told you, I'd really like the Napster idea of paying 10 bucks a month or whatever it is and just being able to play anything you want.

391
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah, okay, I can't take it with me, but I don't, that's just not the way I consume mood music.

392
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I don't mind it being only when my laptop is connected because I hope that up to my speakers and I get the same enjoyment out of it.

393
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's certainly $10 worth.

394
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
There's not a lot of things that only cost $10 that give me this much pleasure.

395
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, I can think of a couple that come close anyway.

396
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So what I'm going to do from now on in every daily source code is we're going to play a track from Adam's first gen iPod.

397
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Completely at random.

398
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's on shuffle.

399
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm not looking.

400
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Now, if I don't recognize what it is, I may have to just bend over and because it's on a different shelf here on the bake as a rock.

401
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So I can take a look at it.

402
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Hold on, let me, yeah.

403
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
To the next track at random.

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Okay, I don't want to hit.

405
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Wait.

406
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Let's see what it comes up.

407
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Let's see what this is.

408
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Wow.

409
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
This is something called the barrage.

410
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And sing, sing, sing.

411
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Enjoy.

412
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Thank you.

413
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Thank you.

414
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Thank you.

415
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Thank you.

416
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Thank you.

417
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Thank you.

418
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Thank you.

419
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Thank you.

420
00:23:43,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Thank you.

421
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You know, at first I didn't really know why that would be my first gen iPod, but listening to that holy crap.

422
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Man.

423
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh, wait.

424
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm not supposed to do any more tracks.

425
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Only one per show from Adam's first gen iPod.

426
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I think that's going to be the name.

427
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Another track from Adam's first gen iPod.

428
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Something like that.

429
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I got to find out more about that track.

430
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I have no idea how wound up on the iPod.

431
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I don't have any backstory on it.

432
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Of course, that is part of the game.

433
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Sometimes I'll know how what it is, what this sound file is, or what it's about, or

434
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'll have some personal story, just not this time.

435
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That's always a great way to start off a new segment.

436
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
That's it for our serious listeners.

437
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
They're gone.

438
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
That's too bad because they probably would have enjoyed this promo.

439
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Hi, Adam.

440
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
This is Matt Detillow of the Matt's Today in History podcast.

441
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm going to let you know how honored I am to be a new member of the Pod Show family.

442
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You know, I started listening to the Charlie long before you were using episode numbers.

443
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You're enthusiasm for this new medium.

444
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And you're belief that every subject and pursuit under the sun needs a podcast.

445
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Made me want to try my hand at it.

446
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Thank you.

447
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
For you Charlie listeners, if you're a serious student of history or just a casual observer,

448
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'd like to invite you to check out my podcast, a Max Today in History.

449
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
In five to ten minutes, I covered an event that occurred on today's date sometime in the past.

450
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
From sobering to silly, from before the Roman Empire to the fall of communism and beyond,

451
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I covered all the little at a time.

452
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You can find me at Matt's Today in History.podshow.com, and wherever podcast congregate.

453
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And I'm really glad that show is now a...

454
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's with us in Pod Show.

455
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I've been listening to Matt's Today in History. I like it very much, and I'm just just been informed

456
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
that Peter was going to make an edit in that another track from Adam's first gen iPod,

457
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
so we can still fit Matt's Today in History, promo in on the within the serious satellite window.

458
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Peter, you truly are awesome, dude.

459
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Unlike this guy,

460
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Adam, I'm one of these Nylons, a New York London guy.

461
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Awesome.

462
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But first of all, Nylon, I've not heard that before.

463
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
A New York London guy, a Nylon.

464
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Hmm.

465
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
For the Wilmoton, and it's this Trinity thing that's got me a little farther,

466
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
because quite honestly, you know, I like to show,

467
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
but you should downplay if not eliminate totally the green aspect of it.

468
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Because...

469
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But before this guy goes on, I want to say something about this,

470
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
because I've received a couple of emails,

471
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
that in tone sound very much like this guy,

472
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and I'm going to tell you what his message is first,

473
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
so you can be completely biased when you listen to him.

474
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
But essentially, he's going to say that

475
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
the whole Trinity project is not green,

476
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
and you shouldn't be promoting green with this project.

477
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And, you know, I don't think I've ever used the word green.

478
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The whole point is about independence

479
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
about being able to do something on our own without anyone's help,

480
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
let alone big oil or any type of industry.

481
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's fun, you know, and it's saying something,

482
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and it's about people and about relationships,

483
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and about doing something ourselves,

484
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and in a way sticking it to the man, because that's always fun.

485
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
But I cannot recall one single episode,

486
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
where I ever said it was even in the entire discussions of Trinity,

487
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
that it was green.

488
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Yeah, I'm still here,

489
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
it's still here my iPod bleeding through,

490
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
so I turn that off.

491
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So I think that there's something a foot here,

492
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and it's really interesting, because when you hear this guy talk,

493
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
it doesn't sound like he's been listening at all

494
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
about anything about Trinity,

495
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
my baby poo colored 1984 Mercedes station,

496
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
bio diesel station wagon,

497
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
but it's going on the road,

498
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
fueled entirely by biodiesel,

499
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
not ethanol.

500
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Oh, I got a lot of those, too.

501
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Don't you know that it takes more energy to produce my old fuel,

502
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
than it does, and then you get out of it?

503
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
No, that's not the case, because this is not ethanol.

504
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
This is shit we get from the Chinese restaurant.

505
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The only energy it takes is a little bit of elbow grease.

506
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So anyway, so listen to this guy,

507
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and tell me that this isn't someone who is just,

508
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
it sounds like the guy's calling a list.

509
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Okay, I gotta call this guy,

510
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
gotta tell him he's full of shit.

511
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I don't know, listen.

512
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You're the least green person probably out there.

513
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You see your own admission on Twitch,

514
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
they had a million miles on version.

515
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Okay, wait a minute, there's another clue.

516
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
There's no, he's on the least green person out there,

517
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
by your own admission on Twitch,

518
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
you have a million miles on virgin.

519
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Okay.

520
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Well, maybe the all are coming from Twitch,

521
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
all these letters, from Twitch listeners.

522
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That's kind of weird.

523
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
All right, listen more.

524
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm flying gold, so I know that's probably about 300,000.

525
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's miles, you've actually flown.

526
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But hey, you steal two foot prints on the virgin,

527
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and you're commuting every month.

528
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
How you want to company virtually?

529
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That's a different story.

530
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You then have souped up cards on in your house too,

531
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and then you go flying on a plane.

532
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You're on plane, mind you.

533
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Three, so, and who knows how much electricity

534
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
you're wearing up there in the cottage mansion,

535
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
whatever it is?

536
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So, yeah, you know, the turn of your thing is fine.

537
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And then finally, I love the fact that you're going to have all these

538
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
sorts of there promoting Trinity,

539
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
they're going to be paying for it.

540
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
They're going to drive it 50 miles,

541
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and how they're going to get back to their starting point.

542
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Cycle run, probably not,

543
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
but they have a car, but it's a train.

544
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So, they'll be adding to the CO2 footprint.

545
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So, let's just keep Trinity of the car,

546
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and you're given away a car, which is a nice thing to do.

547
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And let's just stop the whole green thing,

548
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
because we like to do,

549
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
but you really have no license to be talking about green,

550
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
given the jack, virgin miles, your own flight.

551
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
These folks are going to drive 50 miles up and get back 50 miles.

552
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's not really the right thing.

553
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Thanks.

554
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Hey, I don't know who this is,

555
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
but stop fucking calling Disneyland's hole.

556
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Really?

557
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Now, I'm sorry, man,

558
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
but I have not played this as a green thing at all.

559
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
At all.

560
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And this to me is just,

561
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I think this is part of a group of environmental terrorists.

562
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Now, I do plenty of green things,

563
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
but that's a whole different discussion.

564
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
This is about something completely different.

565
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And if you're not listening,

566
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and don't propagate the hate, my brother,

567
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
that's no good.

568
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Now, I got an email from Drew Darmcus.

569
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Hey, I'm not sure if you're familiar with the, I'm sorry.

570
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I gotta blow my nose once I can hold on.

571
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I didn't really blow it,

572
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
but I didn't want you to hear the other thing.

573
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Hey, I'm not sure if you're familiar with the stand for project,

574
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
folding at home.

575
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I doubt, of course, got my attention.

576
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's a distributed computing program similar to

577
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
City, which was the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, I believe,

578
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
which is distributed through a screen saver.

579
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
God, that was a cool application, wasn't it?

580
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The processing power goes towards research for cancer and other diseases.

581
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh, nice.

582
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Go to dndfoldingathome.com.

583
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Oh, man, another thing I got to install on my computer.

584
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You had another little server, a widget thing.

585
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It'll be rolling around in the background.

586
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Ah, this was great.

587
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Apparently down under the catch and on,

588
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
why do I always do the accent when I say down under,

589
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I apologize, that must be pretty insulting.

590
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Australian commercial on television.

591
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
This is a YouTube clip.

592
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh, on a second.

593
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Of course, I forgot to shut up.

594
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I got to plug the computer back in.

595
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
There we go.

596
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Okay.

597
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
This should do it.

598
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Listen to this commercial.

599
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's tough growing up in a family of scrunches.

600
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
My parents of scrunches.

601
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
My sister's a scruncher.

602
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And my brothers.

603
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm a folder.

604
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
My great grandmother was a folder.

605
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
But she's dead.

606
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I reckon I'll be a folder till the day I die.

607
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
If you're a folder or a scruncher, Australians love sobbing.

608
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Oh, don't you just love that.

609
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You guys are so smart.

610
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And remember I talked about that.

611
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It turns out it was a Lego, an automatic Lego machine.

612
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That not only folds your toilet paper, but then cuts it for you.

613
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I got a YouTube message.

614
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And it's from Ed Hidden of the light source podcast.

615
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
StudioLighting.net.

616
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And you said, this is a project that me and my friends built for school at the UC Berkeley.

617
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's made of Lego Mindstroms.

618
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Is that it?

619
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Mindstroms?

620
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Sizzers and some scrap metal.

621
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
With all things considered, I think it turned out all right.

622
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
No, it does it fold your paper for you.

623
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It also cuts it.

624
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It would be the perfect accessory for a fancy high tech Japanese bathroom.

625
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Really awesome dude.

626
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I really don't mind doing the fold myself.

627
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But I will put a link in the show notes because I don't know if I did that last time when I talked about it.

628
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I love it.

629
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
At least now we know it wasn't it.

630
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
What do I think it was like an erector set turns out?

631
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's just good old Lego.

632
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Hi everybody.

633
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's Ed O'Vat host of the Ed's Mixbag podcast.

634
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Saying hi to all you Charlie listeners.

635
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You've heard me before here on the DSE for various show promos.

636
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But this time I'm here to tell you that after producing 70 shows,

637
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I finally took the plunge and I'm now hosted by Pot Show Plus.

638
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yeah.

639
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Find me at Ed's Mixbag.potshow.com

640
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and get all the new subscription feeds at my show page.

641
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Oh and Adam, just one more thing.

642
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Everyone is invited to hear Whitney Steel speak a mind about

643
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
her recent involvement in the One Tree Hill TV show competition

644
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
in a recent Skype interview.

645
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I had with this podcast singer songwriter diva.

646
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
That's coming up on Saturday, March 3rd, 2007.

647
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
But the full episode number 73 of the Ed's Mixbag podcast

648
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
at Ed's Mixbag.potshow.com

649
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and by the way.

650
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Hold her.

651
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah.

652
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I figured as much.

653
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
All right Ed.

654
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Thanks, man.

655
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Welcome aboard.

656
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Okay.

657
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Last one for today.

658
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Another awesome song.

659
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I got an email from Andy Stone.

660
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Adam just let you know I've released my EP in the coffee shop.

661
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
When, for download, you kindly played the title track in January.

662
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Since then, I've made all four songs.

663
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Podsafe.

664
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And would be very appreciative if you check them out at my page.

665
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm Pod Show.

666
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Of course, I'll link to that in the show notes at DailySourceco.com.

667
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It'd be more than happy to.

668
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But the back and drink.

669
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You walked in and a new plot.

670
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Was introduced to me.

671
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But what's that red blood from my head?

672
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The letter said nothing to me.

673
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Literally.

674
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
They've felt transparent on the edge.

675
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I couldn't see.

676
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I asked if you liked Oscar Wilde.

677
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Drunk comedies.

678
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But what were you like as a child?

679
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And did you feel the green?

680
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But what's your main job?

681
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
College major.

682
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
What you have and love the team?

683
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
To love the dream.

684
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You say it'll bring us another love.

685
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's quite lovely.

686
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
The music melted through the air.

687
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I love the shadowing of all the other people there.

688
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It wasn't that the ring.

689
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Though it's our next story.

690
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
This will all eclipse by me and you.

691
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
That's not true.

692
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And yet I can't tell them about you.

693
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I know it's not unique.

694
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I know it happens every day.

695
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
When you be for me.

696
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You say it's never been that way.

697
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But never the right.

698
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Even precise.

699
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I can't see that point of view.

700
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I believe it's true.

701
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Cause there is no time for this love.

702
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I can see you.

703
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Thanks for really hoping one of these days.

704
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
We bump into the Beatles on Adams first gen iPod.

705
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Andy Stone in the coffee shop.

706
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
When winding up the daily source code five five two from the Curry condo.

707
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Northern California for a nice Monday.

708
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Hi everybody.

709
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Another couple days somewhere in the middle.

710
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm going to I'm going to lose a show somewhere between traveling back.

711
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
To the cot.

712
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Well maybe not Thursday Friday.

713
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
We'll see.

714
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Now we can't miss football.

715
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
We can miss football Friday.

716
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I'll do football when I get home Friday.

717
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But maybe a little bit late.

718
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Maybe a Friday afternoon football.

719
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
All right.

720
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Adam at occur.

721
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I don't podshow.com.

722
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Sorry.

723
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I haven't quite set up all the professional Gmail enterprise edition yet.

724
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So keep it still the pod show.
