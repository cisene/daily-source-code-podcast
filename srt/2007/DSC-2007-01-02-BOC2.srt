1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Daily source code listeners, you've got it, the best of the Charlie.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The 60 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The following is an actual pod star conversation. May 1st 2006.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Pod star emergency. This is Adam.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, I'm stuck at a stop wait.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And the guy on the car next to me is listening to corporate radio so loud.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can't hear my favorite podcast.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay sir, try not to panic. I've just called in an air strike from the pod father.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Bad things happen to people who listen to bad radio.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Is everything alright now sir?

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes, yes, thank you. Oh, bless you.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Pod star. Tell us where bad radio lives.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And we'll make sure it's gone.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
His name is Adam Curry. He's always in a hurry.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No man will write up stories.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Through us from three to three.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
His name is Adam Curry.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And both his vision's blurry.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The old song.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Dog that furry.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And deep three.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then say hope for his name is Adam Curry.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
His name is Adam Curry.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
His name is Adam Curry.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
His name is Adam Curry.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hey, Daily Source co-listers.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is happy from bedtime stories my kids love.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And welcome to the best of the Charlie.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's spend through some of the best stuff that's ever happened on the DSC.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, Adam's moving to the new Curry, L.A.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Or whatever he decides to call it.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, as you all know, this year Adam got voicemail hotlines.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And as soon as he installed them, he started getting some really, really cool calls.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Like this one from Chino.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Adam, this is George from Chino, man.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm doing time up here in Chino.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And we love to listen to the chop chop.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Especially when we're having sex with each other after lights out, man.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You know, I even downloaded a picture of you on the internet.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That I came to my cellmate back when I preached him up and writing like a wetted new old man.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So hey, keep on the good work.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And hey, if you're ever up in Chino,

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
so we're going to buy for a conjugal visit.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And if you didn't do much trouble, maybe you can smuggle a file in your ass.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hey, that would be a big help to him, man.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He's out.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, Mark.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I got it.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Over the weekend, I did show Patricia a second life.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And I was a little wary to be quite honest because, you know, she's so smart.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's like online game.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mm-hmm.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah. Okay. What's it about fucking?

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I said, well, there's that.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And she said, well, just don't let anyone see you.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is why I love my wife. She's so incredibly smart and with it.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But she was actually fascinated.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And she's been asking a lot of questions.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And she has some pretty good insights.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And we've been talking about business opportunities for second life.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And, you know, people keep asking,

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
When will we see Lady Patricia in the castle?

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I said, well, that could be one hell freezes over.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But her characters are so character-so to your copies.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We have no situations.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you're inside the way, you're a second life property.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Help. Help.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, just kidding.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's your neutral neighbor, comic-stable blogger,

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
known in second life as comic-signor.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So it was nice meeting you in second life, Adam Kerry.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Thank you for teaching me how to operate Bazooka in second life to shoot down a star ship.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Anyway, I have a question. I have a question to everybody interested in virtual realities.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How to be sure, how to be certain if anonymity must be granted

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that the other person in virtual reality is female

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and not male who is just pretending to be female.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Maybe your listeners could help out.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So, so, see you in second life neighbor.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah, okay neighbor, that's right, next to the castle in second life.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And if you're just joining, you know, please check this stuff out because

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
it really will mess with your head.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I mean, I'll be the first guy to share it to point out some really good drugs that won't kill you.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay, that's what second life is, secondlife.com.

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And so, comic strip blogger purchased a parcel of land right next to the castle, the curry castle.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And he put this huge lighthouse on top of it.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And now, you know, and it's like, okay, when I first moved there, I bought the land.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It was almost no one around.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Now, there's a couple other castles.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's getting pretty crowded and I have to make some decisions here.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But, you know, I'm trying to be good neighbor.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, I flew up to the top of comic strip blogger's lighthouse and he was unpacking.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It wasn't a bazooka, it was an atomic RPG.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And it's kind of like the unique, of course, second life is all based on hackers and programmers.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So, it's very common to help out new people.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And, you know, show them the way around.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Because there's always someone who showed me and showed everyone the ropes in the beginning.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And so, I showed them how to unpack it and how to shoot it.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I think, actually, CSB, since you own that spaceship, there's a preference you can set,

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
which is make, was it make damage permanent?

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Something like that.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I think that's the way you can blow stuff off.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Because in the damage, actually, we'll take place and you'll have to rebuild.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You can't just restore it.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Something like that, I'm pretty sure.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So, I was hanging out in second life quite a bit over the weekend.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And it was, once again, a mind-bending experience.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, let me answer that second question, a comic strip blogger.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's very, very easy.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Now, the way second life is currently run or large portion of it is girls who are online.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Typically, they become an escort.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They make themselves really pretty.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
They get hit on all the time by guys.

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And then the sooner or later, the pimps come out.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And they say, hey, you know what, you can get hit on by guys in second life all the time.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But if you come over here and dance in my club and if you want, you can become an escort.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You can make money and then you can go shopping.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And there's a lot of shopping in second life.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's very hard to find male clothing for your avatar.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But there's lots of stuff for women.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I've just tons and tons of stuff.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You can't, in fact, I think this will be hugely successful with women, although probably

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
you're right comic strip, probably a lot of the cute women who are in there are guys or

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
young boys trying to make some linden dollars to go and build stuff that can shoot other

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
people out of the sky.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So there's only one real way to know.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And I've done this myself.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You go shopping with her.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Go shopping with her first.

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And that's how you know if it's really a woman or not.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You can just tell.

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And so I went shopping with a couple women over the weekend.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Actually, Angie B. She went with myself and I have a business partner in second life.

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This is really cool.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't want to say her name because I don't know if she wants me to mention that or how

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
silent or upfront she wants to be about the partnership.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
She's an ex escort.

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
She's stunningly beautiful.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And she really wants to have a purpose in second life.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And I've had some ideas for a while and she's been on for a couple years.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So she knows exactly where to go to get stuff.

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
She knows all the great designers, all the great engineers, programmers, developers.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We're thinking about sitting up our own sim, which means we even run our own server.

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm confident we can we can make money out of this.

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And you know me, I'm always the guy was looking for a way to commercialize because that's my life.

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I like doing things that I have fun doing and make money out of them.

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's kind of what I've always done.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So, and I went shopping with her and with Angie B.

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And they bought me some new hair.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And I could tell, you know, it's like, no, I know Angie B is Angie B.

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So I know that she's a girl.

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And, you know, she shops like a girl.

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's obvious.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So that's the way you tell.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
See, as B, you don't need to know anything else.

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Just go shopping.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
See how they react.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Usually that'll be a dead, a dead giveaway within the first three minutes.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Good morning, Adam.

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is Logan from Southwest Florida.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I just got through listening to you Charlie from fighting.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, it's morning in my part of World Anyway, buddy.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I wanted to ask you a question.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I know that you're a person who enjoys the herb.

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm a few years older than you are.

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And I just recently changed the job and changing the job.

169
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I had to take the usual, you know, drug and alcohol tests.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So that then I had to study for the test and had to abstain for like a month and a half or so.

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Which is really a pain in the ass.

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But anyway, what I would like to ask you know, you smoke.

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, who told you that?

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So you require the employees of Pod Show to take a drug and alcohol test.

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Dude, if I did that.

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We'd have no pod show.

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That would be a question.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes, okay.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Very much respect to you and your family.

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I enjoy it in listening since February.

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Don't have any intentions starting on old podcasts.

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But I am a listener and my right time.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The only thing, buddy, is what someone do the best of the week of the Charlie.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So people can download it, stay on Saturday and get all your highlights of the week.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You know, maybe a hour, hour to half long.

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But just raps it all up and cut that off a little.

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, you know.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We have no show left over.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Anyway.

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's a good idea.

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's a very good idea, Logan.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I like that a lot.

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Did he say the best of the Charlie?

194
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You know, that is a great idea.

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Somebody really ought to do that.

196
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, the Yanks versus Britz conversation begins to heat up.

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And then we hear an interesting song with an interesting requirement.

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Hi, Adam.

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's Glenn from the Zeta Show in Cape Town, South Africa.

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I thought it sounds engine or your comment regarding your Yanks versus Britz segment on your show.

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, wait a minute.

202
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Hold on a second.

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Let's do that differently then.

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's do it this way.

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's do this.

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And now a word from our sponsor.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's the Yanks versus the Britz.

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows that it's apparent to see.

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They're just like you and me.

210
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's the Yanks and the Britz.

211
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The Yanks versus the Britz.

212
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Mind the gap.

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I had him at Glenn from the Zeta Show in Cape Town, South Africa.

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I thought it sounds engine or your comment regarding your Yanks versus Britz segment on your show.

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I've got to say that I'm with the Britz on this one.

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
South Africa and although we have our own cultural identity, we do follow mostly the European trends.

217
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Although we cannot ignore the fact that in some ways the Americans do have an influence on us.

218
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well, a lot of our programming on TV in the movies.

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We watch originates from the USA.

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Of course, there is something that the rest of the world likes to mock the Americans about.

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I've been to the USA before in one thing that it's me every time.

222
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I go there was how Nationalistic the Americans are.

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If it is in American, it isn't good enough.

224
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Dude.

226
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Whoa, that's a shot across the bow, my friend.

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Particularly from someone coming from South Africa.

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know if you will be able to do it by the way.

229
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Quite simply I was quite surprised when Colt played it very well.

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Whenever they come in, man English music has always done great in the states.

231
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
We love it over there. The thing is is the last lit of the alphabet. The rest of the world pronounced it as stayed.

232
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah, well, you know, that's just silly. Okay. Z is just dumb. It's not a zebra. It's a zebra.

233
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Where does that come from, by the way? Why is that different? Why do we say Z and you say Z? Could someone please enlighten us?

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And we know about Z. But we're, uh, they only know it as Z. And hearing Z just confuses them a lot.

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
One thing I've noticed too over the years is how ignorant some Americans, as well as other foreigners are about South Africa or Africa for that matter.

236
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Meach in the word Africa and connotations negative, although, uh, like poverty, HIV-AIDS, civil wars, etc.

237
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Spring to mind. I think the funniest question that we get asked is where the wild animals, like elephants, tigers and lions, roam our streets.

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Where as the reality of that is that such animals are actually roaming in wildlife reserves around the country.

239
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And where our cities are booming metropolis with skyscrapers, tide roads, suburbs, etc.

240
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There are a lot of positives about South Africa and I think it's time for people to take some time out to see them.

241
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And see what a great country South Africa actually is as well as Africa.

242
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Well, Adam, you said you wanted to come to Oswonday, but how about coming to Cape Town and hooking up with a flat around the peninsula?

243
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And instead of drafting dots, we can do a lack of brine instead, or if you guys know it as a barbecue.

244
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, and before you come, you can take a listen to the Z.S. show at the Z.S. show.com, search for us in iTunes. Cheers.

245
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Dude, if you said the Z.A. show, you'd have more subscribers.

246
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Thanks, I appreciate it. It makes a lot of sense.

247
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But what you're saying about South Africa, I live in Uganda as a child, not quite South Africa, but yeah, I wouldn't mind going back.

248
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And people do have a wrong perception. It's like a rack, you know, I went to a rack and it was like an eight-lane highway.

249
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
From, you know, all the way from Kuwait, from Kuwait, past the border, all the way up to Baghdad.

250
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So I do have something that Mark Yoshimoto Namcoff sent me from Pacific Coast, Hellway.

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's a video, and I'll make sure to put a link to the original source into the show notes for today, dailysourcecode.com.

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's not entirely about masturbation.

253
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well, my father says you're nifty.

254
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And it's nice.

255
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You've put a photo layer, and we both agree that human rights abuses are unfair.

256
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You understand your feeling, and you're not afraid to share.

257
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And I think I could do something with your hair.

258
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You smell nice, and you'll grow the end.

259
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
We both like foreign movies.

260
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
My mother says you have that touch of glass.

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, I can see a shining future where we'll die a log and nurture.

262
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But there's one last thing I feel I need to ask.

263
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Do you take it in the air?

264
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Because you're beautiful and curvy, but unless you're kind of worthy,

265
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
There's no way you and me are gonna pass.

266
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Do you take it in the air?

267
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Do you take it in the air?

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
When it comes to brands, you've got a button, but unless you play the bottom,

269
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take a pass.

270
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, you're adorable, reliable, but is your in-as-playable.

271
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And that's the information that I need.

272
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But you would do it if you love me.

273
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If you're nervous, what about me?

274
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You'll be able to control the death and speed.

275
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Do you take it in the air?

276
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Do you take it in the air?

277
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Because I voted in a shipment of the relevant equipment.

278
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I got lubricant and poppers and some brass.

279
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Do you take it in the air?

280
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Do you take it in the air?

281
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If you need more information on this type of penetration,

282
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We can always take a course for this class.

283
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You see, I'm not the kind of fellow who can get up on the nail

284
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and know I know I get a little color in my sex.

285
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Well, how they find just so happens that I've brought my nails

286
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
wrap on and some meds go into height in the effect.

287
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Ready?

288
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Do you take it in the air?

289
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Do you take it in the air?

290
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Do you take it in the air?

291
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The wet spots.

292
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Do you take it?

293
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Thank you very much, Mark.

294
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yoshimoto.

295
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Look at the video.

296
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Actually, you heard the audio only.

297
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Wait until you see the video.

298
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's fantastic.

299
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Where have these guys been, huh?

300
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Everyone in second life is going around having cyber sex with each other.

301
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh, that is so sad.

302
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Please, don't tell me that.

303
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's sad.

304
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's not sad.

305
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh, I was afraid of that.

306
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No, it's not sad.

307
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I think it's either a...

308
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's a human thing.

309
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, I think it's a human thing.

310
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It always ends with fucking some reason.

311
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
For some reason.

312
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
For some reason.

313
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And I've talked to a couple of the escort girls.

314
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
In fact, just about every cute girl in second life

315
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
has it one time or another worked, quote, worked.

316
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Well, they will love you Adam Newman.

317
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah, if I give them a thousand lindons.

318
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
They love me a long time.

319
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Lindon.

320
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
There's a lot of really twisted fantasies.

321
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah.

322
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, that I believe I know about that.

323
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Oh, yeah, really?

324
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah.

325
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
How do you know?

326
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's been, you know, it's been for years and years and years.

327
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And yes, people, it's very extremely strange fantasies.

328
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah.

329
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, some definitely weird stuff.

330
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But, you know, I think the brain is still the largest sex organ we have.

331
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So if you're stimulating the brain based upon some visual images,

332
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I have to say, I can see already because I've seen the figures

333
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
that those men have in second life with those big baskets

334
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and, you know, walking around with...

335
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Boring, boring.

336
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Big muscles and everything.

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah.

338
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah.

339
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Well, that's a part of it.

340
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, the guys want.

341
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Well, of course, mine is a true representation of real life.

342
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yeah.

343
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Particularly my arms.

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah.

345
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I have arms like tree trunks.

346
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's second life.

347
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's an expensive skin.

348
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Nathan Tacos.

349
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Tentacles.

350
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Tentacles.

351
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Tentacles.

352
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Tentacles.

353
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
No, I think that...

354
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I think there's not an area that I'm interested in delving to deep into,

355
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
but I think that the way people have sex in second life is something new.

356
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It is definitely something new.

357
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It is something...

358
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm very safe.

359
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Very safe.

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Very safe.

361
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes indeed.

362
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah.

363
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But it's fascinating.

364
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And so anyway, so with the palace, which...

365
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They're building it.

366
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Now, I'll put some pictures up somewhere.

367
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I want to show you that this morning.

368
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's phenomenal.

369
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
This is going to be so beautiful.

370
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And we have actually...

371
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We hired people to work in second life.

372
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
We had a meeting on our land.

373
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I mean, if you're getting...

374
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Of course, it's all...

375
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It is a game, but then again,

376
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
isn't all of life a stage.

377
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And each of us must play our life.

378
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Life is a game.

379
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It add them.

380
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
This is George Ramchino, man.

381
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Hey, there are these two guys who are working in the prison laundry.

382
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And they say your hair wasn't as cool as Ricky Rackman.

383
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So I stabbed them in the exercise jar.

384
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
With a knife by me from a spoon handle.

385
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Hey, just one man.

386
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There were a couple of the new guys on a said block.

387
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And one of them kind of looks like you.

388
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And from behind, if you know what I mean.

389
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
He lets me soak his hair, which is nice,

390
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
because it reminds me of the chop chop.

391
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And man, you know what's crazy though?

392
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
His thinker looks just like her loader.

393
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Uh-oh.

394
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh, man.

395
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I got a goal.

396
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I think one of those very enation guys just bought me for a carton of lucky strikes.

397
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'd better go do my stretchy so I don't pull a hammy.

398
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'll catch you later, man.

399
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Mr. Chacha.

400
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Be out.

401
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh, yes, our friends from prison.

402
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Glad that we're making a difference for you guys on the inside.

403
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I was made aware of the fact,

404
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
just two days ago, right here on the Daily Source Code,

405
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
that it is national, may is national masturbation month.

406
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And go figure.

407
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Wouldn't our buddy Jess Smith just love to hook into that?

408
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You've been a naughty monkey,

409
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
but I'd really have to thank you.

410
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
If you hadn't been so naughty,

411
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'd never have to spank you.

412
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
A naughty naughty monkey,

413
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll really have to say,

414
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
you've been so bloody naughty.

415
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm spanking you today.

416
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Here we go.

417
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Oh naughty naughty monkey,

418
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'll really have to thank you.

419
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
If you hadn't been so naughty,

420
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'd never have to spank you.

421
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
A naughty naughty monkey,

422
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'll really have to say,

423
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
you've been so bloody naughty.

424
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
No spanking you today.

425
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Here we go.

426
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh, okay, Belly.

427
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
A naughty naughty monkey,

428
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll really have to thank you.

429
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
If you hadn't been so bloody,

430
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'd never have to spank you

431
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
A naughty naughty monkey,

432
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll really have to say,

433
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
you've been so bloody naughty.

434
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
There we go.

435
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
A naughty naughty monkey,

436
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'd really have to thank you.

437
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If you hadn't been so naughty,

438
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I would rather spank you.

439
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
A naughty naughty monkey,

440
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'd really have to say,

441
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
it's a bloody naughty.

442
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's spanking you today.

443
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yes, the fabulous Jeff Smith available for Wedding Sparmitts was, and Spankin.

444
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,840
And actually, for some good-ass tunes, the JeffSmith.com, that's G-E-O-F-F, the JeffSmith.com.
