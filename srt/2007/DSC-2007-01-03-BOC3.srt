1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,240
It's Adam coming to you from still the old curry cottage.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,520
We've got another best of Charlie lined up ready to roll for you.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,400
It is best of Charlie number three, a little house update where you can hear there's

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,960
lots of stuff going on, dogs barking in the background, pick up the key to the new place

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
yesterday.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,080
I immediately lit the fireplace, start and warm everything up, it's all very exciting.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,480
I'm standing amidst lots of boxes here.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:37,240
As I start to pack up the studio known as the second bedroom, the last thing they're

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,720
going to come actually reminds me a bit of a Jackson Brown song to load out.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,600
The last thing they're going to come and get is the podcast console, so I'll be able

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,200
to continuously provide updates and bring you the best of Charlie's throughout this

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
ordeal.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,960
Yeah, remember what's the Jackson Brown lyric, just be sure you got it, I'll get to go before

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,960
you come from IPNO.

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,200
That's kind of the way I feel.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,560
In between everything, I've also been reading a fantastic book by friend of mine, Rudy

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
Sarzo.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,280
I was currently in DO, but you may remember him from, well, as days with the white snake

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,040
in the late 80s and the early 80s, of course, with Ozzy Osborn, I also played in a quiet

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
riot.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,840
And it's really, it's filled in a whole bunch of gaps for me about history that I witnessed,

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,600
not all of it because Rudy's a little bit older than I am, but I don't know if I'll

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,800
be telling you more about the book in the next couple of days or more about the move either

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
way.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,760
We've got another fantastic best of Charlie sent in by Sunder Huxberg.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,600
Sunder is, I presume he's from the Netherlands, let me just double check.

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
He's email address.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,640
Yeah, he's, at least he's using a Dutch email address.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,440
It's nice about this, he said, at about a really good time making this, it's a good

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,840
start from me in 2007, it's this year.

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,240
I'm going to focus with my company on producing podcasts for others.

33
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,240
Thanks for the opportunity.

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,400
Now, he, he says his customers well, fantastic.

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,880
Here's an example of what Sunder can do in today's best of Charlie's episode three during

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,240
the big move of 2007.

37
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Enjoy everyone.

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Oh, by the way, today's show brought to you by, I can't get away from it.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,120
Tom, the yard, the brand new movie, which opens up in, was it just eight days from now?

40
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,200
Go to stompthepodcast.com, Tony Costas will tell you all about the movie.

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,760
I know you're going to enjoy it.

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,240
It's from the same people who had us promote the little man movie, which of course was

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,000
a totally senseless movie, but God, did you love it?

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Was it the number one movie?

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,440
I think we're going to do it again.

46
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Okay, here it is.

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,920
The video scene number three for the big move of 2007.

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Enjoy everybody.

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Good morning.

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Good morning.

51
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Good afternoon.

52
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
Good evening.

53
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,920
How's tomorrow down there in Australia?

54
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,720
Unless you forget what the daily source code is all about, please feast your ears on

55
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
this movie style promo.

56
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,520
You know, world, work corporate monstrosities control the airways.

57
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,160
A new media has a risen one man leads the internet rebellion and that will change the

58
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,600
world forever.

59
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Potual production presents Adam Curry as the pod father in the daily source code.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,600
Gotta go listen to that show.

61
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,240
There's just no two ways about it.

62
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
The guy with the heavy voice told me to do it.

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
I cut the class.

64
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
I skip school.

65
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:43,680
I hold that to sleep out in the parking lot of coke and nuts where they had the tickets on.

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,960
Now we're too obstructed.

67
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,360

68

You are two years off when ride the lightning came out.

71
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,360
You felt no pain with birds and died but you cried when they canceled.

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Baby, what this?

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,800
You mess around the club.

You got the sugar's urban stuff.

78

358
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:56,640
Oh yeah, when Adam gets back to San Francisco, I'm gonna buy some stock and Chris go.

359
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:06,640
There's big Christmas grin and holiday chuck goes ill tear up your owing with his greased up knuckles from Thanksgiving.

360
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:23,640
Red to the new year, he's got one hand right up your rear and while you're celebrating holiday masses, he's ramming his fist right in the air asses it's.

361
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Adam Curry's, Mary Mary Fistmus. Oh yeah.

362
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:52,640
When he gets started, it's hard to make him stop. He'll treat you like Sherry Lewis treated lamb chop because he's bringing joy to all the girls and boys with a rubber ball gag and the bag of sex toys.

363
00:14:52,640 --> 00:15:09,640
On his belt, you'll see some mistletoe and he's got his hand inside your Cheerio and maybe while you let him deck your halls he'll give you a reach around and tickle your balls it's.

364
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Oh yeah. Adam Curry's, Mary Mary Fistmus.

365
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:42,640
Insert cowbell here, he's making a fist and greasing it twice and when he's all done, you'll probably need ice. He knows if you've been folding, he knows if you might scrunch and if you're really lucky he'll give you a donkey punch.

366
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Oh yeah. Adam Curry's, Mary Mary Fistmus.

367
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:58,640
It's a real sing along. Mary Mary Fistmus. Mary Mary Fistmus.

368
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Happy Fistmus everybody.

369
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:11,640
Wow. Yeah, I did feel that one. Well, that one in my ass. You could actually do that with two people that exercise just to make it a little bit more challenging.

370
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,640
I've got to go ahead and visualize what I look like doing that and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

371
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:28,640
But the funniest thing was yesterday, your dad had emptied out the entire refrigerator and was resetting the shelves and your mom freaked out.

372
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,640
I mean, I should have, I should have videotaped it. It was so, so fun.

373
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:40,640
It was absolutely hysterical. Once this starts with each other and one of my mom gets mad.

374
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,640
No, then it's all over. That is quite, you know. I know. I'm not like that.

375
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:53,640
If I had gone ahead and cleaned out the refrigerator and changed the shelving without your approval, I think.

376
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:00,640
What do you do? What's you doing? No, you would have said, what the fuck did you just say?

377
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:08,640
What's the matter, Karen? I have a terrible sore throat. Do you have any throat lozenges?

378
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,640
Well, I have my balls. My balls? What's that?

379
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,640
It's a throat lozen shape like a lollipop. Nothing will sue the ear throat faster than my balls.

380
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Wow. They sound great. Do they last a long time? Absolutely.

381
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,640
In fact, you can leave my balls in your mouth for hours at a time and that smooth, soothing feeling never goes away.

382
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Wow. I can't wait to try them.

383
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,640
Here you go. Now tell me, don't my balls feel great on the back of your throat?

384
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,640
Hmm. My balls throat lozenges. The next time your throat hurts, lick or suck on my balls.

385
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,640
Now a new limited teabag flavor.

386
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,640
I knew that my day was going to be funky yesterday. It started off with a phone call.

387
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,640
So, you know, what's kind of like, I just thought it was a joke. She sent me a picture by the way.

388
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Okay. I don't know who this is but stop fucking calling. Is Alan Moll.

389
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
So.

390
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,640
Oh, my, man. I'm getting so much trouble.

391
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,640
And he sounds like 7 feet tall. I'm gonna beat me to the bottom.

392
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,640
I think I'm gonna hang back on the tour now.

393
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Oh, my, man. He's such a cool stuff.

394
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
I will give you a bigger advice.

395
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
Oh, wow. Thank you.

396
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
I mean, I'm not angry.

397
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,640
I'm just done in the world where we're in.

398
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
Fuck.

399
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:38,640
I question everything.

400
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Everything is wrong by definition.

401
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Answer me in repetition.

402
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,640
You don't know anything.

403
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,640
It pauses me in hindsight.

404
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Frammonition.

405
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,640
My style heart is fiction.

406
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,640
I bitter harmony.

407
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,640
I know that it sounds better than before.

408
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,640
I guess I'm just expected more.

409
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,640
The bigger ball we've won.

410
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,640
Now stillness is all it's done.

411
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,640
We're making plans a real time.

412
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,640
But we're on the burning cover.

413
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,640
When I close my eyes.

414
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,640
You always disappear.

415
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,640
It's not like me to shave and say I'm sorry.

416
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,640
Where's my finish line?

417
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,640
It's never been down here.

418
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,640
And I've been waiting for a blacklist of rain.

419
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:27,640
But the world will wait for me.

420
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,640
So I thought when I was feeling upset.

421
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,640
But I was so many young and still bad.

422
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,640
There is happening.

423
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,640
Others will be plans.

424
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,640
I know what I was.

425
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,640
It's not like me to shave and say I'm sorry.

426
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,640
Where's my finish line?

427
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,640
It's never been down here.

428
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,640
And I've been waiting for a blacklist of rain.

429
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,640
It's never been down here.

430
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,640
And I've been waiting for a blacklist of rain.

431
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:31,640
And I've been waiting for a blacklist of rain.

432
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,640
When I close my eyes.

433
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,640

It's never been down here.

441
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,640
It's never been down here.

442
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,640
It's never been down here.

443
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,640
It's never been down here.

It's never been down here.

It's never been down here.

459
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
It's never been down here.

460
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
The last zero.

461
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,640
We got it out, fucked up.

462
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,640
Beyond All Repair.

463
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,640
I think I'm going to hang back on this one.

464
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,640
Yeah got in yesterday.

465
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,640
After an uneventful flight.

466
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Virgin Vs 19, C12k If you look and blown me up.

467
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640
That's the one.

468
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Men live live live.

469
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,640
You inquire- Descreation.

470
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
But not me.

471
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,640
My desperation's loud.

472
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:56,640
And so it is, I'm taking your rejection like a man, a man who's freaking out, I admit, I have my flaws,

473
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:08,640
I get drunken with the bed, but look beyond that, and I'm sure that you would love me.

474
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:19,640
I'm a gentle man by far, but if you break my heart, I'll shoot your puppy.

475
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:41,640
My love is real, so is this pistol in my hand, and it's really loaded.

476
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:53,640
You love your dog, but I wonder, would you love him more than me when his heads exploded?

477
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:06,640
I am not the violent kind, I will even swat that fly, but all this love stuff really makes my head claw.

478
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:18,640
I'm a Christian man in power, but if you break my heart, he's a dead dog.

479
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:30,640
Whoa, funny day, what can I say about the way you make me laugh when you told that dog is sick me.

480
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:43,640
You clever girl, you call the cops while I was wiping off the drops of blood for where he bit me.

481
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:55,640
What's it been, three weeks since I've been in, and today they're going to release me.

482
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:07,640
The doctor said all the voices in my head are in my head, and she that was easy.

483
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:20,640
And I know now I was wrong, and you won't see me no more, because I'm sedated with an order to restrain me.

484
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:34,640
Who but if some night by chance, in some cosmic circumstance, we should cross paths while your dog is sniffing round,

485
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:48,640
finds me hiding behind your couch, minding my own business, and you scream so loud you startle him, and he begins to attack me, so I fire three or four morning shots above his head,

486
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:57,640
but I hate you instead, no one can blame me.

487
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:05,640
George Worsbach. Oh man, wouldn't it be cool if in like, you know, I don't know.

488
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,640
Fifty years were all dead, and people still play that song, wouldn't that be fucking cool? They could certainly happen.

489
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Hold on, can't sign off without that.

490
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,640
