1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In a world where TV networks, movie studios and record labels, still think they can govern

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,720
what you see in here.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,200
One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses and make big media

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,120
corporations wet their tiny little pants.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,760
From Pod Show, home of the world's most dangerous new content comes the Daily Source Code

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
with Adam Curry.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,200
Notice Yara Charlie, five-four nine-year-old, was $16 million worth of airplane

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:40,120
strapped to my ass, and the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,120
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:17,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,120
We're just gonna tell you, just gonna find somebody here.

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,120
You better get a better one.

13
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:33,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

15
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

17
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:57,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:04,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

19
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:12,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

20
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

21
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:31,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:42,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

25
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

26
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:23,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

31
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

32
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

33
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:44,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

34
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

35
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,120
We're just gonna find out, with another man.

37
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,120
One, two, three, four.

38
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
There you go.

39
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,120
How they sound a lot heavier.

40
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Not quite together there.

41
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,120
All right, of course, a link to their page on the network.

42
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,120
It is to be found at dailysourcecode.com.

43
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,120
That sounds pretty heavy.

44
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
All right, beat stockers.

45
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Hey, everybody, it is Tuesday.

46
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
You know how I know it's Tuesday?

47
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Because it's trash day.

48
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
That's how I know.

49
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,120
That means I got to get up with Crackadon and take that crap out.

50
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Because, oh, please, please don't take your trash out at night.

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,120
In the middle of the darkness, because you'll get a ticket.

52
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Mmm, they check that shit all the time.

53
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
It's Tuesday.

54
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,120
I'm still here at the curry manner.

55
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,120
In the affluent suburb of Surrey, known as Gilford, in the United Kingdom.

56
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,120
West side of G-Tam up here in the attic.

57
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
I will be leaving tomorrow, though.

58
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
So tomorrow, I arrive in San Francisco.

59
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Just in time, I think, for the clouds.

60
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,120
It's been beautiful for the past week or so, according to all the reports I've heard.

61
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
And, you know, so now I'm coming.

62
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Now it's going to fricking rain.

63
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,120
So we got to most of the business that I was stayed here.

64
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,120
A cleared up or cleared up is not the right word.

65
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
It's rolling.

66
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Let's put it that way.

67
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,120
I just can't tell you about it yet until all the shit signed and everything.

68
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,120
You know, we got a little bow around it, but I can't wait to tell you.

69
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
It's really exciting.

70
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,120
I mean, there's not a lot of stuff that's going to make me postpone my trip.

71
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
You know what I'm saying?

72
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,120
And up here in the attic, thank you so much for the glowing compliments of the attic up here,

73
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,120
the third floor of the manner.

74
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,120
If you haven't seen it, shots at curry.com, you can see this from fun.

75
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
Some funny comments on there as well.

76
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Hey, is this where the green room is?

77
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Yeah, I wish.

78
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
I know chicks here, man.

79
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,120
It's going to be, uh, I think I relatively short show today.

80
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,120
It's, uh, it's what I'd call a slow day in podcast land.

81
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,120
There's literally nothing came in.

82
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,120
No openers, no promos, no.

83
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,120
Not very, very little, uh, was sent in.

84
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
Uh, let me see.

85
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
Let me just get my Google notebook here.

86
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Yeah, there are a couple of important things we got to talk about today.

87
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Well, at least I think they're pretty important.

88
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,120
First of all, uh, you remember my, um, uh, hey, is this a voice mail message?

89
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Oh, that's interesting.

90
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Hold on a second.

91
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Let me see if, uh, I thought that this was, oh, wow.

92
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Let me see view message.

93
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Oh, shit.

94
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Is it gone?

95
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Oh, no, here it is.

96
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Well, this would be interesting.

97
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
I was going to talk about EMI.

98
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Um, one of the big three record labels.

99
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Um, now remember my prediction where I said that, um,

100
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,120
you know, the record labels are going to come crumbling down in 2007.

101
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
And when I said the record labels,

102
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
I'm really talking about the music selling arm,

103
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,120
not the licensing arm because this is what, you know,

104
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
the big guys have figured out is that, um,

105
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,120
the licensing of music is, of course, we're all the money's at.

106
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
What's the problem with the product is,

107
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
well, consumers are shifting their behavior,

108
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,120
and they're finding perhaps the purchase of music much less important

109
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,120
than going to the concert or buying the merchandise or building

110
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,120
some form of fan relationship with, uh, with the artist.

111
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
So that is definitely morphed.

112
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Uh, yeah, folders.

113
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,120
There we go with a nice bit of the splendor flavor blend blend.

114
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,120
I'll see if this comment relates home on.

115
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Hello, Adam.

116
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,120
So I'm like, turn it here.

117
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Currently, we're looking at a Shelton.

118
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,120
I'm just listening to the SC 548.

119
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Talk about podcasting license and then the Dutch

120
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
been the first one out.

121
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Well, actually, you think of fine,

122
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
the MCPS.

123
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Oh, crap.

124
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
I wanted to play that in just a second.

125
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
We'll get back to that.

126
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
Okay.

127
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,120
So, um, now that it's all the rumors have been swirling around

128
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,120
about, um, about EMI looking,

129
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,120
well, first of all, they had two profit warnings

130
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
right after another.

131
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Now, when you are in big company land,

132
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
this is a bad idea,

133
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
particularly if you have investors,

134
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
investors do not like surprises.

135
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
They don't even like surprises on the good end

136
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,120
because it gets them freaked out about the next quarter.

137
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
Believe me, having run a public company,

138
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
was wrong.

139
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,120
We know exactly what that's about.

140
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
But to do a profit warning,

141
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
uh, and then another profit warning a month later

142
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
is really, really bad news.

143
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Heads will roll as no doubt about it.

144
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,120
So what they've been looking into as far as I understand

145
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,120
is leveraging their licensing business,

146
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,120
which is pretty constant, um,

147
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
or it's proved to be pretty constant

148
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
to leverage that against their,

149
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,120
their sales arm, their sales division.

150
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
And the problem with the sales division is,

151
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
yeah, this is how it works.

152
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,120
When you, uh, when you publish a CD,

153
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,120
you, um, you have to pay right then and there,

154
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
there's a whole bunch of,

155
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
when the CD comes off the press,

156
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,120
uh, there's money that has to be paid

157
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,120
for the person pressing that CD.

158
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,120
And if you send those out to the store

159
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
and they come back,

160
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,120
you basically lose your investment

161
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
unless you can dump them somewhere

162
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
and sell them really cheap.

163
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Of course, don't even get me started

164
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
about where that shit goes to.

165
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Ever hear of cutouts? Anyway.

166
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,120
Um, so they're really, really suffering

167
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
on that end.

168
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
And, uh, and now,

169
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
the, uh, the word the this morning

170
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
was that Warner records

171
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
has made a bid, uh,

172
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
to acquire them.

173
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
I don't know if that's acquiring

174
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
the record division or, uh,

175
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
the, the sales division

176
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
or if it's the publishing division.

177
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
And, yeah, we may never know

178
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
until the deal is done

179
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
because this stuff is, you know,

180
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
so typically cloak and dagger.

181
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
Um,

182
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,120
but it is great

183
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
because amidst all of this confusion

184
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,120
we're going to bum rush the charts.

185
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
If you, um,

186
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,120
if you don't know what that's about,

187
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120
you definitely want to go to

188
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,120
bum rush the charts.blogspot.com.

189
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
There's a link, uh,

190
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
all over the place.

191
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
I'm, I'm seeing it pop up

192
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,120
on all kinds of podcast on March 22nd

193
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
a day when, as far as we know,

194
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
there are no major releases scheduled.

195
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Uh, we're going to entice

196
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
the audience.

197
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Our audience is collective audiences

198
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
and this thing is spread

199
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
not pretty far and wide

200
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,120
to buy one track by, um,

201
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
one band.

202
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
And the band we've chosen, uh,

203
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
is black lab.

204
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
For a couple of reasons,

205
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,120
one kick ass music to really

206
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
involved in podcasting.

207
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Three, they used to be, uh,

208
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
an act on a major label.

209
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
They got dropped.

210
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
And, uh, so we're,

211
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
what we're trying to point out here

212
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
is that as podcasters,

213
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
I'm not going to say the C word

214
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
because I,

215
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
uh, I'm certainly believe in the,

216
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
the community of podcasting.

217
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
But I do think that we can kind of

218
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,120
bond together here and show that we do.

219
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
Have the power to make a difference.

220
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
We can make one track rise

221
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
to the top of the iTunes music charts.

222
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
By sales.

223
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Which is just as good as,

224
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
as showing something on sound scan

225
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
and in my humble opinion.

226
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
It's the new version of sound scan.

227
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
And of course,

228
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
you can make some money along the way

229
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
if you, uh, use an affiliate link.

230
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
So your listeners, uh,

231
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
when they spend their 99 cents,

232
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
you'll get a piece of the action.

233
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
I, I look, I'm going to buy the track.

234
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
And I hope all of you will.

235
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
I'm not putting the links out yet

236
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
because it has to happen on March 22nd.

237
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
That's when we want a complete bum rush

238
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
to show this, uh,

239
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
show this power that we have.

240
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
And then maybe maybe,

241
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
some of these idiotic schemes,

242
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,120
which have been published just recently.

243
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Yesterday we talked about the,

244
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,120
the National Association of Music Publishers

245
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
in the Netherlands,

246
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,120
charging thousands of euros a year.

247
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
Up to like, you know,

248
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
for some from a minimal audience,

249
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,120
for commercial use of music and podcasting,

250
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
and commercial podcasts.

251
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
And, uh,

252
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
what was it,

253
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
it was still about, uh,

254
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
about six,

255
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,120
seven hundred dollars a year,

256
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,120
translated from euros.

257
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,120
For a non-commercial podcast,

258
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,120
up to 10,000 listeners.

259
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
And yesterday I said,

260
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
this was the first, uh,

261
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
published license as such.

262
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
And apparently,

263
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
as you just heard from the comment,

264
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
I'm wrong.

265
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
Let's listen to it again.

266
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Hello, Adam.

267
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
So I'm like,

268
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
turn it here.

269
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Currently, we're going to,

270
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
Shelton, I'm just listening to the,

271
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
the SC548.

272
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Do about podcasting license,

273
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
and then the Dutch,

274
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
in the first one out.

275
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
Actually, you think it's fine,

276
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
that the,

277
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
the,

278
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
the,

279
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
the,

280
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
the,

281
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
the,

282
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
the,

283
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
the,

284
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
the,

285
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
the,

286
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
the,

287
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
the,

288
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
the,

289
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
the,

290
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
the,

291
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
the,

292
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
the,

293
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
the,

294
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
the,

295
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
the,

296
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
the,

297
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
the,

298
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
the,

299
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
the,

300
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
and I'm just меч,

301
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
to,

302
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
the,

303
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
this is musical about the dats,

304
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
we,

305
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
the,

306
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
uh,

307
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
the,

308
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
short-sinces,

309
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
here's the�.

310
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
The,

311
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
the,

312
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
the,

313
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
the,

314
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,080
You must take specific precautions to ensure that your dentists be songs cannot be written.

315
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
How does your podcast?

316
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,680
I don't know what they mean by that.

317
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,600
They're much better to be sound it.

318
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Go, men, show.bt.show.com.

319
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Cheers, Adam.

320
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Yeah, right, Adam.

321
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,560
I guess I was wrong about that, but of course it's still nowhere in comparison to the great

322
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,520
deal commercial radio has, which of course is also completely recordable and ripable

323
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:33,720
and there are plenty of shows where you can record an entire album, radio stations,

324
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,800
pay performance fees, but because of the confusion about what is a podcast, it's downloaded

325
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,720
or people are going to rip stuff off and that's what we have these ridiculous fees.

326
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,640
So I don't think there's going to be a lot of traction for that.

327
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,840
I mean, I have honestly, I've considered it.

328
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,320
I was thinking of myself, well, you know, of course I can afford it.

329
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
I can afford it.

330
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,760
Podshow can afford it, but then like, so what good is that going to mean is it's going

331
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
to do for me.

332
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,560
I'm not going to see, you know how much I love music history.

333
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,440
You know how much, how important I think it is that you hear certain songs that you just

334
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,280
don't hear on the radio anymore, certain genres of songs.

335
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,440
But to have to pay for the privilege of education and actually helping sell music because

336
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,320
it's been proven time and time again that when any song is played on my show at least,

337
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,120
I can't speak for others, but I'm pretty short similar.

338
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
But that sells music.

339
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,360
It's just a fact, I'm not going to pay for that privilege.

340
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
It pisses me off.

341
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,560
I'd much rather bum rush the charts and help independent artists and independent labels also

342
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,560
who are really understanding that this world has changed and there's nothing wrong with

343
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
a record label.

344
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,480
I think it's fantastic.

345
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,840
But the record labels have changed.

346
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
They've morphed.

347
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,360
They've turned into something new and they think they're much, much, much smarter than the

348
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,160
big guys.

349
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,240
And I think the big guys are in big, big, big, big trouble.

350
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,840
Let's see what else that I have here I wanted to talk about.

351
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:03,680
Oh, man, did you hear about this, serious satellite radio, which you may be listening to

352
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,480
this show on serious at this very moment, is set to merge with XM.

353
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
The arrival, the arch rival I have to say.

354
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:23,160
Now, of course, this still has to go through anti-competition and monopolistic judgment

355
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,640
and rulings.

356
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,800
But there's a pretty good chance it's going to work and that they will actually merge.

357
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,240
It's just, it's really twisted my nut here because I'm looking at what analyst are writing

358
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,360
and a lot of the analysts, even in the financial times this morning, as you know, I love

359
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,760
that yellow newspaper.

360
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,440
Yellow, not as in yellow journalism, but the papers literally yellow and the stories

361
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,880
are shortened to the point.

362
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,520
But I read that analysts are saying, well, you know, these satellite radio stations,

363
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,240
they have to combat the iPod, I'm thinking, well, crap.

364
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,480
That's us.

365
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
What's going to happen?

366
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,560
I mean, I can see many, many ways to embrace this.

367
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,200
But it's going to be very interesting to see because when mergers take place, man, all kinds

368
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,000
of funny crap happens.

369
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,560
So I don't have any news.

370
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:16,440
I've received no internal memos and I am on several internal memo lists at serious.

371
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,320
I don't own any stock, which is, I don't know, I stopped investing in stock in a long

372
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
time ago.

373
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,080
I'd like cash and buildings to be quite honest, they seem to last a lot longer.

374
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:35,320
But wow, that is really, really interesting news.

375
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,920
Now, of course, you know that the way it really works, the real sales channel for

376
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,760
serious is not radio shack.

377
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,920
It's not your local electronics store.

378
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,240
The same goes for XM, the real sales channel, the real pipeline, these guys work on

379
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,800
all the time is the automotive industry because they're the ones that are building these

380
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,240
receivers right into their cars as they roll off the line.

381
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,000
And in fact, you, I think you can even build in your subscription to either serious

382
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:11,080
or XM, you can build it right into to your monthly lease if you lease the car or

383
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,640
you just pay the subscription separately.

384
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,800
But that's where the real, the real sales are going.

385
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,320
And guess what, most of the auto manufacturers are the trouble as well.

386
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,240
I think who's not in trouble, GM's not in trouble, right?

387
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,920
Is GM now poised to buy Chrysler?

388
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Is it's crazy?

389
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,920
What a nutty ass world.

390
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,920
By the way, last night I finally saw the, because I had it on Sky Digital, I saw the top

391
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,200
gear episode, man, these guys, you know, the new season of top gear, this is only the

392
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
second episode.

393
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,680
I'm a big fan of video productions.

394
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,520
And when we do, uh, Mary Clare dot podshow dot com, we do the Mary Clare, the

395
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
mass Ted show.

396
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,800
I mean, I am making female porn.

397
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
I mean, I'm not doing it.

398
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,120
The team is, but that's what I'm looking for, I'm looking for female porn.

399
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,080
Look here, completely, the male version of non-sexual porn, automotive porn.

400
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:11,520
They make these, these clips, these, these packages of video about the cars, they are so

401
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
sexy.

402
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
They're so well done.

403
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,520
I can't wait until the media room is done to have the surround sound and the really,

404
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,000
really big screen because that shit is just awesome.

405
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,960
And indeed, they built a space shuttle out of a, a robin, a reliant robin, which is

406
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,280
one of those three wheel jobbies.

407
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,960
And I have to say, the whole launch and everything, it looked pretty damn good.

408
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,440
You know, the, the main booster rocket never, jettisoned from, never jettisoned from the

409
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,920
reliant itself, uh, but it looked like a thing was flying, man.

410
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,280
And I have a, uh, I really think that they probably could have glided that thing down to earth

411
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,240
reasonably well, but it never jettisoned from, uh, or the, the main fuel tank never jettisoned.

412
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,240
And so it just kind of crashed in a huge ball of flame and smoke, but what an amazing

413
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
show.

414
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:03,560
And you know what, as we say in, in video production, the money was definitely on the screen.

415
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
Get I at him.

416
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
Guess what?

417
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,400
Phil Walker calling in from Australia and I live in Canberra, would you believe?

418
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Ah, camera.

419
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Of course.

420
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,240
This is, you know, so I did that interview.

421
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,560
What two weeks ago, where is the publication of the interview about podcasting that I did

422
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,440
with the, uh, with the reporter from the Canberra Times?

423
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,360
So you'll reference to the Canberra Times was, uh, very interesting and brought home that,

424
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,760
so even though you're a global podcast, it can still, uh, right back down to our little

425
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
town.

426
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,640
Let me tell you a little bit about Canberra, mate.

427
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,160
It's, uh, a small city, even though it's the capital of Australia, about 300,000.

428
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,480
But I would say that, um, we are a very IT literate community, uh, even though we're

429
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,880
a small place and, uh, away from, uh, the main cities of, uh, Sydney and Melbourne.

430
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,880
So yeah, we do probably know a little bit of our IT, and I suspect you've probably got

431
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,160
a lot of, uh, the people who listen to podcasts in this small community.

432
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,560
Yeah, I got to say something.

433
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,880
I'm just sitting here realizing how cool this is to have real, um, audience interaction

434
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,120
or as they say an advertising consumer engagement with Australia.

435
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:13,720
You know, there's, you hear, um, lots of radio guys and, uh, mainstream radio, mainstream

436
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,400
media in general, like, well, you know, we get comments from Australia, but do you actually

437
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,920
have a fucking conversation with people from Australia?

438
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
No.

439
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,600
I love it.

440
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,000
Uh, in regard to the camp of times, uh, it's a small town paper, really.

441
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,920
Um, yeah, small circulation compared to the big rags, not good, not bad, but, uh,

442
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,280
probably just, um, just a small town newspaper.

443
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,680
Um, I actually take a bit of a positive out of the, the call you got from, uh, or the

444
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,640
email you got from, uh, from the camp of times and that they've come to you, mate, rather

445
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,720
any other so-called podfathers out there.

446
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,440
You are the podf...

447
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:48,920
Yeah.

448
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
You know, holler.

449
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Father.

450
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Yeah.

451
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,280
I saw, um, well, we all know Ricky Jervais stole the title, and I saw Cameron from, uh, the

452
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,720
podcast network, also with, uh, with, you know, some headline like the true podfathers.

453
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
That's fine.

454
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Y'all can be podfathers.

455
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I'm happy to share.

456
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,320
The person is driving this podcast business as far as I can tell, and, uh, they've

457
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,000
come to you because they recognize that.

458
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,320
So, uh, even though we only have a small distribution, it might be worth, um, yeah,

459
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,320
really, uh, giving them the, the credit for, uh, at least, uh, come into the right source

460
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
of information.

461
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
Mate, I've said it once.

462
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,320
I'll say it again.

463
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,320
If you get a chance, uh, check out Nick Walker on the podcast music network, my 20-year-old

464
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,320
son out there trying to make a living in the music world, uh, Nick Walker, podsafe,

465
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,320
music network, give him a spin and now you'll love it.

466
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Take care from a hot Australia.

467
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,320
I hope everything's okay out there, mate, and, uh, rock on.

468
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Yeah.

469
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Bye.

470
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Bye, Phil.

471
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Uh, this comment, uh, two or three times, and I've basically been holding onto it.

472
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,320
Because, uh, I listened to, uh, Nick songs, and honestly, they didn't do much for me.

473
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,320
And I felt really bad, you know, because he kept sending the same message.

474
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,320
And I really wanted to play the comment, but I didn't want to like, you know, leave off the,

475
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
play my son bit.

476
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,320
And it's cool that he's promoting his son.

477
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,320
And there's son that has stuff up on the podsafe music network.

478
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,320
But honestly, I really spend a lot of, I pay a lot of attention to one

479
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,320
I'm playing on, uh, on the show.

480
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
And I just don't know if this fit.

481
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,320
And so today is a perfect day since everything's kind of slow anyway.

482
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,320
And those of you on serious satellite can play you out with the song.

483
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
And I'll come back for those of you on the podcast.

484
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
Because of course, as I thought about it, I'm like,

485
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,320
what makes no fucking difference.

486
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,320
If no one else likes the song, just fast forward.

487
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
I know.

488
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,320
There he is, Nick Walker.

489
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
Won't fall back in love.

490
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

491
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

492
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

493

I'd love to hear what you think about it.

I'd love to hear what you think about it.

I'd love to hear what you think about it.

I'd love to hear what you think about it.

I'd love to hear what you think about it.

498

I'd love to hear what you think about it.

499
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

500
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

501
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

502
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

503
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

504
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

505
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

506
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
I'd love to hear what you think of it.

507
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

508
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

509
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

510
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

511
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

512
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

513
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

514
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

515
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

516
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
I'd love to hear what you think about it.

517
00:23:42,320 --> 00:24:00,320
And I won't walk back in love

518
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:07,320

522
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:42,320
And I won't walk back in love

523
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:53,320
And I won't walk back in love

524
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,320
I've quake in the mirror valley

525
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:09,320
Bad luck around

526
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:16,320
Check on children in the daytime sadly

527
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,320
I can't get down

528
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:44,320
And I won't walk back in love

529
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,320
I won't walk back in love

530
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:55,320
You can find a link to page on the pod safe music network at dailysourceco.com

531
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,320
I was just looking through Napster

532
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,320
I have to say I like Napster as a service because it's all you can drink

533
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Basically I don't know what I pay it was like nine bucks a month or something

534
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,320
And you can only play stuff when you're connected online and through Windows Media Player

535
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,320
And you can only play stuff when you're connected to the camera

536
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,320
Because I want to play some EMI music for you

537
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,320
I think you guys who are working at EMI, they got no time right now to mess around with my customers

538
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
All right, ADV, how are you?

539
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,320
And you're going to be so jealous from you here that I've got on the red couch this week

540
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,320
Another miss Rachel Fuller, she's from in the attic fan

541
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,320
She's talking about all manner of things you won't hear anywhere else

542
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,320
I know about how sarcastic that woman can be

543
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,320
And believe me, I have never heard sarcasm like it

544
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,320
Then you need to get yourself to who's on it

545
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,320
Don't beat the pod show, don't come to Rachel's buildings

546
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Y'all is a, that's OJ calling OJ Borge

547
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
Who's on it?

548
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
BTpodshow.com

549
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
Rachel Fuller on the show

550
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
Definitely take a look at this one

551
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Rachel of course is the star of in the attic

552
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Another fantastic show that we're running all over the world

553
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
But of course it's a UK show

554
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,320
In the attic.btpodshow.com

555
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
Or in the attic.podshow.com

556
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,320
Rachel and her boyfriend Pete Townsend

557
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,320
And in this particular show, OJ does a,

558
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Rachel's a singer as well

559
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,320
I'm totally in love with her voice and with her songs

560
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,320
And he does a segment called, what is it?

561
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,320
You or the who?

562
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:32,320
And so he, he sights lyrics and then Rachel has to guess

563
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Whether it's one of her songs or whether it's one of the who's songs

564
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Now you should definitely check that out

565
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Who's on it.btpodshow.com

566
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
So David Bowie did something brilliant

567
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,320
And I'm gonna say this was probably 10 years ago

568
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,320
He put together a bond

569
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
What's a financial instrument

570
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,320
For all of his future revenue

571
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,320
From publishing of his, from publishing of his music catalog

572
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,320
And of course the publishing is handled by EMI

573
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,320
I believe at the time he pocketed 50 million

574
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
Dollars

575
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,320
And of course he didn't, all the, all the residuals that come in

576
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Don't go to him, they go back into the fund

577
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,320
And people get repaid, etc

578
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,320
And as you know, big fans of Bowie here

579
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Really big fans

580
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,320
And a shit Patricia slept with him once

581
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,320
Or twice, I don't know, she hasn't really told me for sure

582
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
But it's interesting that

583
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,320
The first 245s I ever bought in my entire life

584
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
The first one was

585
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,320
Rubber band man by the Detroit spinners

586
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,320
The Detroit spinners, yeah, Rubber band man

587
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,320
And the second one was this song from the album Low

588
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Sound and Vision

589
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Which is just a fantastic track, particularly the way it kicks off

590
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,320
A little bit of music history for 80 on the day

591
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
To source code

592
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Whatever you do, don't rip it out of this podcast

593
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,320
We'll both go to jail

594
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320

Oh yeah

657
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,880
Yeah, why don't you hop on over to iTunes or Napster or whatever if you have a music service

658
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,760
the Yahoo Music Service by a track from David Bowie, please so that you know when those guys

659
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,280
are getting ready to sue me for playing sound and vision I could say well why did you

660
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:06,840
see if we sold anything dickheads? It's so confusing so it says it's from the album low which

661
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:12,280
is correct when it says released 1977 this single is from 1975 I know because somewhere I still

662
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:20,120
have it and it says 1975 right there 22 years ago oh my goodness still love that shit love what

663
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:27,800
he's doing uh so you know a free Trinity update today uh still working on wrapping my head

664
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:33,880
or you know what I yesterday I actually got into the vibe of you know what I think I want to uh

665
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:40,040
I think I I think I want to go on part of this journey I just suddenly got excited about it and I

666
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:46,840
wouldn't mind to hit in a couple of states so uh still working on par abroad the Palo Alto podcast

667
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,600
are freaked out after she heard what I said yesterday oh man and everyone keep keep keep keep

668
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,240
you cool keep you head on she's gonna roll everyone will be able to participate I'm just trying

669
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:05,160
to figure out how and uh I think we uh we actually might have a real sponsor for this thing so

670
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,000
as I said you know I'm maybe looking to compensate some people if they're going above and beyond and

671
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,280
it's still gonna be uh a real oh it's gonna be user generated project there you go that's the hook

672
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,880
and uh let me see

673
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:30,920
so I got a email from Oscar who says yes I'd like to apply for an account on the N800 or should I say

674
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,640
I wish I could come into your ports yes yes Oscar I will allow you access to my ports

675
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:44,280
so I've spoken to my contact at Nokia Nokia and we're gonna get that set up so we're gonna get set up

676
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:50,440
is an N800 with the navigation in place uh with the the world map of course we intend to see

677
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,120
Trinity go all the way around the globe right and I think what I'll do is I'll set it up in the

678
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,320
condo and in San Francisco just have Luke send it over there so we'll have a dedicated IP address it'll

679
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,880
just you know sit there all day and then we'll just allow people in there's a couple of the comments

680
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,360
or received which sounded like a real administrative nightmare saying well you could set it up so that

681
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:18,440
there could be a couple hours per program or per day but I'm thinking you know it's like everyone's

682
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,640
gonna have scripts in there and it's gonna be a real mess and I guess I'd have to set up user accounts

683
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:29,480
and you know now I'm gonna have to figure out how to administrate the N800 as a as a Linux server

684
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,160
that may just be going you know at the end of the day it's you know a lot of trust here you come in

685
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:40,440
you try your test just grips you look at it on VNC see if it works and then you clean your

686
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,800
shit up and then the next guy should come in I guess or maybe we maybe I should just create

687
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,400
accounts I guess I can do that maybe I'll just create accounts so that each individual can

688
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:57,800
can try themselves stuff to ponder on the plane ride tomorrow for sure okay I got another

689
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,280
pod save song for you gonna play out with I just could not resist playing the song because well

690
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:10,120
