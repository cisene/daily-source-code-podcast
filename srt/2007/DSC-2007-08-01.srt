1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey Tony, what are you doing?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Uh, trying to find something good on the tube, you know, just serve in the channels.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,200
Tony, you'll never find anything like that because you're doing it old school.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
That's the old channels.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,600
You need to search the new channels, the podshow channels.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Go over to podshow.com, check out the channels.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,600
You got all kinds of channels.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,600
You got geek brief TV.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,000
Ah, that Kelly Lewis really does something to my hard drive.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Uh, yeah.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And you got channels from music, you got channels from video.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Josie Todd's got a whole bunch of channels over there.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,680
So go check those out.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,680
This is the new wave.

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,240
It's a new wave of media and it's the new channel surf and riding the new wave.

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,200
You know what I'm talking about, Tony?

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,400
Just listen to the DSC 643 and Adam's going to tell us all about the channels.

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
He calls him Cheddar.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,000
The, like, the cheese?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, Tony.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You're smart as a whip.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm testing you, Adam Curry.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Feet Furrier in of the sun.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Girl you know you got no dream.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:26,000
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah,

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let me, all right, we'll watch it in the front of our hearts

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Girl, you never want to kiss me

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I love you, it's not here for you

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Always want you with me, I'll play Bobby and you play with me

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If you smoke that smoke too, that's how much I'm in love with you

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Crazy is, we're crazy too

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Crazy alone, we're crazy for you

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let me, let me, I don't sin it, I saw all of my life

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
To me, let me, all right, we'll watch it in the front of our hearts

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why are you so insecure, we got passionate love

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Girl, we're always framing our machines

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
They got up in the lead, we got to another scene

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We got that I need you, you must have caught at me

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Kid, that's why you don't believe me

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Look, you need me

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Guilty because you are a Car

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Guilty that's right a crazy girl

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Guilty that's right a girl

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Guilty that's right a DJ

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Guilty that's right a girl

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Get me, let me, any of your words

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let me, let meã€‚ Let me, let me

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let me, any of your words

53
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,920
let me let me let me let you make it so you know

54
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,420
let me let me let me let you watch it at the amaha

55
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,420
Give me, give me, and you send it as song for love.

56
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,420
Give me, give me, give me.

57
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,420
I don't know what you know for dinner.

58
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,420
I don't want you to die.

59
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,420
Mash that a lino, watching it die.

60
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,420
I'm just thinking of your pipe.

61
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,420
I ain't no for dinner.

62
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,420
And I'm so good.

63
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,420
I ain't no for dinner, sir.

64
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,420
What?

65
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,420
How the hell?

66
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,420
DJ Max entropy.

67
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,420
The funk with my favorite son.

68
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,420
Of course, CCR mixed up with Black Eyed Peas.

69
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,420
Kicking off episode 643 of the Daily Source Code.

70
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,420
Hey, everybody.

71
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,420
I don't know about you, but I am officially neckard.

72
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,420
I don't know if it's the correct use of the word, but man, man, man, man.

73
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,420
You know, this is tough.

74
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,420
I long for the days when all I have to do is just sit around and make a show.

75
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,420
Boy, what I make a great show for you every single day would be so

76
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,420
perfectly pre-produced.

77
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,420
Sorry about yesterday.

78
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,420
I warned you though.

79
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,420
You know, whenever I say, oh, I think I'll do a show later on.

80
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,420
What happens is I don't get home until nine o'clock.

81
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,420
You know, I have my dinner.

82
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,420
Nine o'clock, of course, I got to watch a big brother while the

83
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,420
dinner is rolling.

84
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,420
By the way, I'm still Brian to win on this thing here in the UK.

85
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,420
And, you know, that's 10 o'clock.

86
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,420
And then essentially, we're taking up until one to pre-produce,

87
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,420
produce, and then, you know, do all the post-production, uploading, etc.

88
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,420
It would be like three hours.

89
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,420
It's kind of what it is.

90
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,420
I just didn't have, I just didn't have, I'm an old man.

91
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,420
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,420
Just don't have it anymore.

93
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,420
Although I, increasingly, I'm finding people still, you know,

94
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,420
will just won't skip an episode.

95
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,420
And some are like a month behind.

96
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,420
So maybe it's a good way to help people catch up.

97
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,420
In that regard, at least it is.

98
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,420
Hey, the music business is really messed up.

99
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,420
I got this link.

100
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,420
What is it?

101
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,420
Actually, by the way, I want to thank Dr. Art for hooking me up with that,

102
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,420
that mashup that we kicked off with today.

103
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,420
And Dr. Art, he's interested in dental medicine.

104
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,420
The next meeting I have with my professionals is to determine

105
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,420
color and size.

106
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,420
If that helps at all.

107
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,420
So apparently, this is from betanews.com.

108
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,420
I'll put a link in the show notes.

109
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:31,420
There was a subcommittee of Congress about performers royalties

110
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,420
for being played on the radio.

111
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,420
You've got to read this thing because what's happening now.

112
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,420
It's, you know, amidst all of this debate about, you know,

113
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:45,420
streaming web radio, paying compulsory fees for all music,

114
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,420
which is not just mainstream.

115
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,420
It's not just any one's music licensed, you know,

116
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,420
signed to a record company or not.

117
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,420
Unless you have a pre-existing arrangement,

118
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,420
such as the Pod Save Music Network.

119
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,420
Now, this is about, you know,

120
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,420
basically it's a bunch of old artists.

121
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,420
And you see this happening every year.

122
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,420
Cliff Richard started yamoring about copyrights expiring

123
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,420
in the UK after 50 years.

124
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,420
He wants to extend it to 70 years because his shit's

125
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,420
coming up for public domain pretty soon.

126
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,420
I understand why he's pissed off about it.

127
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,420
You know, what we can't just keep changing the rules

128
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,420
when we get old, you know, and they're like,

129
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,420
oh, well, this is going to fuck me up.

130
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,420
This is what this isn't what I signed up for, you know.

131
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,420
Now, what's it?

132
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,420
What did I see that was a Roger Daltre of the Who

133
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,420
was doing the same thing?

134
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,420
And now, this is a different issue.

135
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,420
Judy Collins, who sang, uh,

136
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,420
send in the clowns.

137
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,420
One of the songs I dislike the most, I have to say,

138
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,420
just by coincidence.

139
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,420
She's saying, look, you know,

140
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,420
we get record companies made millions on this.

141
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,420
And then we got nothing out of it because we didn't get paid

142
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,420
for every single time we were played on the radio.

143
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,420
So here comes the big raging debate is broad.

144
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
And by the way, that's only in the US.

145
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,420
It's not the same in other countries because there are

146
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,420
performance royalty organizations such as the

147
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,420
SNA, the SNEA.

148
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,420
And I believe CSAC also does some of that as well.

149
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,420
But that's beside the point.

150
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,420
This is really about the United States in this particular

151
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,420
instance.

152
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,420
And, you know, it's like, so they're saying, well,

153
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,420
you know, we're being ripped off by the broadcasters because

154
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,420
they're getting a free ride.

155
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,420
And I have to kind of take the side of the broadcasters

156
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,420
in this because, you know, it is promotional.

157
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,420
And, you know, and it gives you read this.

158
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,420
It's the most absurd thing you've ever read in your life.

159
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,420
I feel bad for artists getting screwed by their

160
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,420
record companies.

161
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,420
But I totally disagree with this whole idea of, you know what?

162
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,420
Fuck you.

163
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,420
Fuck you, Judy Collins.

164
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,420
I'm not going to play your song.

165
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,420
I'll never play your send in the clowns song.

166
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,420
You know, it's, it is about promotion.

167
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,420
You know, if everybody in the world who does something creative,

168
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,420
you know, it just stands in with a handout.

169
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,420
We're going to get nowhere.

170
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,420
You know, there's got to be some hand-offs.

171
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,420
And, clearly, it works because the pod safe music network is growing.

172
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,420
In fact, got a great story about that at the end of the show

173
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,420
about a new band on the network.

174
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420
And it works.

175
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,420
You know, they understand that, you know,

176
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,420
making money off of the music alone just isn't the way to do it anymore.

177
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,420
And I'm sorry if you feel that you're too old to go out and do gigs.

178
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,420
You know, there used to be a lot of jobs that no longer

179
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,420
exists.

180
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,420
It's just that we're just what happens.

181
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,420
It's what happens with technological innovation.

182
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
It really does.

183
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,420
You know, I used to get paid a lot more than I get paid now to do a lot less work

184
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
in broadcasting.

185
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,420
It's just the way it works.

186
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,420
We're in a transitional phase, which could last 10, 15, 20 years.

187
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,420
I don't know.

188
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,420
See, there was some, as a feedback about this actually.

189
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,420
Hey, Adam and listeners of the Charlie Howard Greenstein here in New York.

190
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,420
And I just came across an editorial in the bit player blog on the LA times

191
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,420
about the webcasting royalty issues.

192
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,420
There's some research now that says that the, it came actually from my 365

193
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,420
and said that more than 55% of the music played on its channels came from independent artists,

194
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,420
which is a hugely disproportionate share compared to CD sales and regular airplay,

195
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,420
which is usually about 87% of the major markets.

196
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,420
So basically, people who are doing webcasts on things like live 365 are playing a huge amount

197
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:13,420
more independent music, which basically translates to the fact that the indie music world

198
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,420
has a lot more incentive to keep webcasting alive.

199
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:28,420
It has a lot more incentive to have a more rich and open and independent and free set of music

200
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:35,420
for people to play than the majors and the radio stations and the folks who are basically pushing

201
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,420
for the rate increase for independent web gestures.

202
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:44,420
So some more fuel for the fire is how Greenstein in New York and I hope everyone has great day.

203
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
Yeah, Howard, I appreciate that.

204
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,420
Good friend of the show there, Howard is.

205
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,420
But you know what, Howard and others who are looking at this.

206
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,420
First of all, it's all, it's all food bar.

207
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,420
Every single angle you come at this, it's just a waste of energy.

208
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,420
Route around it already.

209
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,420
Just forget about it.

210
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,420
There's no way you're going to change people's minds and be very careful of the Indies.

211
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,420
Because the Indies are in the big, you know, they're at the big table as well.

212
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:16,420
And, you know, their Indies doesn't necessarily mean independent people who just put their music up.

213
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,420
You know, these are smaller versions of record companies as they exist today.

214
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,420
With smarter marketing plans, I think better packaging ideas,

215
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,420
but essentially the same business model, making money off of the artists.

216
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,420
So, and not, I'm not saying this anything wrong with it, but just be careful.

217
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:39,420
You know, it's like, it's not like just because independent, independent labels are being played more on web

218
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,420
strip streams that it makes any difference that they would necessarily not want their artists to be compensated per person listening.

219
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,420
I think they probably do in many cases.

220
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,420
Probably because they may actually have a back end deal on that.

221
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,420
So, you know, I don't have the answers, but I do know that whatever we're doing,

222
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:04,420
it's a lot better in my humble opinion to put all of our energy and resources into routing around this and fire in the entire train wreck.

223
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,420
You know, please, and don't rub or neck while you're driving by.

224
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,420
But let's just drive by.

225
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,420
Today a very exciting day, I think it's been months.

226
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:20,420
I can't even count the months how long it's been since this savant has been on the show.

227
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,420
And today he returns in true form, my friend.

228
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,420
Hello, I'm Roger here.

229
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,420
You asked us more examples of mainstream media deception.

230
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,420
You have a nice, lovely video called High School House for the intrigue.

231
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,420
There's a thing closely, I noticed it's ever chilly,

232
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,420
you're getting spit roasted with a leaked fat here's old.

233
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,420
But then it seems to be a girl on there, wasn't your age.

234
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,420
So, just another example of a blatant lie surrounding the TV industry.

235
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Why can't this respond?

236
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,420
It's why everyone gets so obsessed about things come for 25 times by a big brother lie.

237
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,420
Yeah, when we spend billions of pounds on a wall based on a lie, no one gives us up.

238
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,420
So, that's something he needs to discuss on your show.

239
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,420
Right now?

240
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,420
Oh, my goodness.

241
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,420
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause for Roger Smalls who totally nails it.

242
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,420
What the hell are we thinking?

243
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,420
Yeah.

244
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,420
But you know Roger, and of course your point is so well taken.

245
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,420
Why are we making such a big deal out of being ripped off of a couple of quid for some lies

246
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:48,420
when there's billions being spent surrounding one huge lie?

247
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,420
Yeah.

248
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:56,420
By the way, I think the millions still would have spent and we probably still would have gone for a presence in the Middle East.

249
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:02,420
But the fact that it was brought to us and presented to us as a huge terrifying war on terror lie.

250
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,420
Yeah, that's pretty frickin' offensive for sure.

251
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,420
But I love how you hone right in on that Roger.

252
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:15,420
By the way, I'm still getting tons and tons of feedback on people's experiences with mainstream media primarily.

253
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,420
And a most banister sent me a great link to a YouTube video which I'll put in the show notes as well.

254
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,420
It's called Reality TV Editing.

255
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:35,420
If you really want to see the power of television and how you can take one scene, just one scene captured with multiple cameras and how you can edit that to fit the storyline.

256
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,420
I think it's from BBC Four.

257
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,420
So I'm happy that that's up there illegally on YouTube.

258
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,420
Get the link while you can.

259
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
It will blow you away.

260
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,420
It's really, really well done.

261
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
Just an example.

262
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,420
So the presenter of this show says, okay, so I'm going to tell it really lame joke.

263
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
And then he shows two scenarios.

264
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,420
One where people are laughing and the other one where people are going, huh?

265
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,420
And then he shows, okay, I can make this girl look like she's totally coming on to me or like she's totally not interested.

266
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,420
And literally with the same material just by using digital editing techniques, they show you how it's done.

267
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
And it's, it's awesome.

268
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,420
Awesome.

269
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,420
It's almost as good as watching the Zen TV experiment.

270
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,420
If you watch Big Brother or any of these reality shows, have a look at this.

271
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,420
And I mean, if look, I love Big Brother.

272
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,420
I know how it works.

273
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,420
I love it.

274
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,420
I totally enjoyed a story unfolding in front of me.

275
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,420
And I do not see it as reality.

276
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,420
I see it as a wonderfully told story done by amazing professionals.

277
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,420
It's no more no less.

278
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,420
That's why it's so easy for me to say Brian to win because I know how this stuff works.

279
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,420
Oh, oh, crikey.

280
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,420
Something from the hell way once again.

281
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,420
We're Mississippi Coast Highway.

282
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,420
And you, my big reggae.

283
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,420
But we're here to fucking say hey.

284
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,420
Go to my casterwords.com and the Ferras.

285
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,420
We'll go bang your mom and wipe our cheeks on her dress.

286
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,420
It's not family safer parents.

287
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,420
Go there every day and vote.

288
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,420
Or we'll come kick you in a swirls.

289
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,420
Did I mention that?

290
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,420
That we're all boys.

291
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,420
To both the Razzard.

292
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,420
You suck.

293
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,420
Both the Razzard.

294
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,420
You suck.

295
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
Don't go be up.

296
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,420
Big schmuck.

297
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,420
Both the Razzard.

298
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,420
You suck.

299
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,420
Valenti says ball of bullshit.

300
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,420
Hollywood is bullshit.

301
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,420
Everything is bullshit.

302
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,420
So, for Ferras, bit far you go insane.

303
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,420
To both the Razzard.

304
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,420
You suck.

305
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,420
Both the Razzard.

306
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
You suck.

307
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
To both the Razzard.

308
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
We're fucked.

309
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
Both the Razzard.

310
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,420
You suck.

311
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
Keep that.

312
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
Chiroky.

313
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,420
I think it's pretty clear that Pacifico's

314
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,420
Hellwise has been nominated for a podcast award.

315
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,420
And I have received, probably, 30.

316
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420
40 different.

317
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,420
Please.

318
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,420
People saying.

319
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,420
Oh, please.

320
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,420
Tell your listeners to vote for us.

321
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,420
This is what I hate about awards.

322
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,420
It's fucking lame.

323
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,420
But I know Mark actually played the music and everything on that song too.

324
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,420
So.

325
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,420
They're not playing it for him.

326
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,220
How many pod show network podcasters are nominated this year?

327
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,260
I wonder, I don't know.

328
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,180
But, you know, it's, I don't believe in awards

329
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,780
that the work this way, I don't believe in awards at all.

330
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,980
I just want to see a nice red carpet show

331
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,180
with hot actresses and beautiful dresses

332
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,460
with millions of dollars worth of diamonds.

333
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,980
That's all I really care about when it comes to award shows.

334
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,140
And I'll even look at the magazine

335
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,100
coverage of it later at that, I like, you know,

336
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,340
I like seeing how everybody looks.

337
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,260
That's really what it's for.

338
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,900
You know, from me, who's this from Paul, Paul Parkinson.

339
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,220
Yeah, ITV is admitted that an Alzheimer's patient

340
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,020
who, quote, passes away in the final scene of a documentary

341
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,780
they did actually died three days later.

342
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,380
They're copping to it now, another story of mainstream media

343
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,180
unraveling.

344
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,580
Yeah, it's the big, it's the big deception thing.

345
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,180
How many, there's been so many interesting things

346
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,380
on television, Panorama on the BBC,

347
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,060
did I tell you this?

348
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,900
Maybe I did, no, I didn't, I think.

349
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,180
I think it was Monday night.

350
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,220
They had a huge thing about YouTube

351
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,700
and these happy slap videos where kids are basically

352
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,900
beating each other up.

353
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,660
And other kids' filming on their mobiles

354
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,500
and they put it up on YouTube, which is, you know,

355
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,820
it's not rampant the way it was described.

356
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,260
But yeah, it certainly exists.

357
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,580
And in this country, the happy slapy thing is,

358
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,540
it certainly got a lot of press and was a bit out of control.

359
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,940
I don't think it's all that bad, actually.

360
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,540
School yard fights, I mean, I've been around him,

361
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,140
but just, there was never an audience that was worldwide.

362
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,700
And so I'm not condemning or condoning any of this,

363
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,860
but what was interesting is they went to some

364
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,180
of the big brand sponsors here in the UK,

365
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,420
like O2, a lot of tell-com sponsors, of course,

366
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,100
because, you know, they love advertising on YouTube

367
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
and said, hey, you know, here's your brand right next to this kid

368
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,540
getting his head kicked in, how do you feel about that?

369
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,820
So I would say we'd watch some of the profits

370
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,580
of YouTube go down, because I've heard this story

371
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,580
has been repeated in a couple of different countries.

372
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,100
It's being picked up in the States, you know,

373
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,100
advertisers are not stupid.

374
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,420
They do not want to be associated with stuff like that.

375
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,140
That's why I know episodic programming where you have audiences

376
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,020
that are predictable and, and love to be a part of whatever

377
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,020
the community of that show is that that's a valuable property.

378
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,980
You know, just about those, the royalties,

379
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,180
know all that, and the government, and, oh crap,

380
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,740
don't wait, before I get to that, Keith Murray sent me this awesome

381
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,860
picture.

382
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,580
I before and after Photoshop,

383
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,900
I'm almost second, what was this, let me just see.

384
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,420
It was a red book, there you go.

385
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,180
Faith Hill on the cover of red book.

386
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,020
Now I'm not quite sure how they did it.

387
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,300
If they had the original picture or what it was, but

388
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,900
they've done the before, so the before and after the picture

389
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,740
and like an animated gift file.

390
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,020
And so you see Faith Hill who looks stunningly beautiful by the way

391
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,580
without any photoshopping and then you see your photoshopped

392
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,980
and I'm looking at the changes right now and literally

393
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,620
skinnier, shadows, you know, some grooves in her face

394
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,300
diminished a little bit.

395
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,580
Her arm was made much, much skinnier.

396
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,980
Ah, excuse me, it just makes me sick to my stomach.

397
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,580
If ruling a perfectly good woman, ruining her,

398
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,100
and tricking her is all.

399
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,940
Because we want to be tricked by friends, that's why.

400
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,260
So about about the government and royalties and, you know, old people

401
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,580
wanting to change the the laws when they get old

402
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,620
and they affect them negatively, you know, the next presidential elections,

403
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,980
I'm just going to vote for the youngest person.

404
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,660
I don't give a shit who it is.

405
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,340
Just someone who's young, you know, it's sure you don't have the experience.

406
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,620
But, you know, and the youngest person will never win,

407
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,580
but at least we can raise a profile and get something going.

408
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,580
You know, we got to get more young people in politics.

409
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,780
This is crazy.

410
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,980
This is absolutely crazy.

411
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,340
We're not stupid.

412
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,740
Young people in Iran are not stupid, you know.

413
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,700
Now, by the way, I think a lot of our, you know, let the world be

414
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,020
loving, you know, all together, a kumbaya place, that will never work either.

415
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,540
Because there are a lot of stupid people across all countries who could do a lot of stupid things.

416
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,140
But, uh, but no one, no one who's in politics right now represents me whatsoever.

417
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,340
And I'm not even young.

418
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,180
And all these, this shit actually does affect me as a singer, as a blue singer, from, you know,

419
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,540
the old stacks records days.

420
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,300
Hey, Alex Bernie.

421
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,780
And I wanted to call and reply to Captain Adama, who was on.

422
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,380
And you were talking about channels, which I think is a terrific idea.

423
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,900
And he was talking about the fact that he doesn't want podcasts to disappear from his iPod.

424
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,660
But he wants to know whether or not he's listening to them,

425
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,140
and he wants them to kind of fall off the playlist.

426
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,580
This is not a channel thing.

427
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,420
This is just a basic iTunes thing.

428
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,460
Go in and create a smart playlist that says, put all my podcasts on this playlist.

429
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,460
Keep them sorted out by name.

430
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,420
And you can tell it, play count equals zero.

431
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,220
So once you've played something, the play count goes up to one.

432
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,420
And guess what happens?

433
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,100
When you think the iPod again, it falls off of the playlist.

434
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,020
So your playlist is constantly there and just the podcast.

435
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,140
You haven't listened to yet.

436
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,980
I have a shuffle, and that's what you have to do.

437
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,380
You have to create playlists of your podcast,

438
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,780
because the shuffle doesn't support podcasting.

439
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,700
So I had to figure out the way around it.

440
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,660
But you know what?

441
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,460
That'll work for just a regular iPod listener, too.

442
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,020
So channels is still a great idea.

443
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,260
And now you can create a channel and put it into that smart playlist.

444
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,740
And then, as you listen to the stuff on the channel,

445
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,180
it'll fall off that playlist.

446
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,460
So you're still getting that same kind of interactivity.

447
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,660
And you can still have all the cool features of channels.

448
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,020
And not have to worry about it.

449
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,100
I listened to this already, because you know what?

450
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,780
iTunes will help you take care of it.

451
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,180
So keep up the great work, Adam.

452
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,180
Sorry, I kind of dropped off the grid for a while,

453
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,940
but I'm hoping to be back soon.

454
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,940
Look at for a job, if anything's gone out there,

455
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,740
this is burning.

456
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,380
I'll kill you later.

457
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,020
Hey, man, thank you.

458
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,380
Yeah, I got a job for you.

459
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,380
Create some kind of widget or script or something that sets people's iTunes up

460
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,660
for the, for the pod show channels.

461
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,420
I'll pay you for that, man.

462
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,460
Absolutely.

463
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,460
And for Windows, right?

464
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,700
Because Mac, I know we could do an Apple script or something

465
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,420
relatively simple.

466
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,300
How do you do it?

467
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,740
How do you set someone's smart playlist up like that,

468
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,660
you know, automatically, just to get them going,

469
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,380
because this stuff is hard, you know, people are,

470
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,380
are simplistic when it comes to technology.

471
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,540
The majority, you know, if we really want to get big audience,

472
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,380
we've got to make it even easier than that.

473
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,860
And iTunes doesn't funky shit.

474
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,060
They don't actually take information out of your feed about an episode.

475
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,460
They take the information out of the episode,

476
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,380
which is completely contrary to the way everyone else does it.

477
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,940
So we got to work around that.

478
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,820
And, man, I'd love it if we had some kind of set up script.

479
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,660
There's something you like double click on.

480
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,460
It immediately, it says, okay, you know,

481
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,900
what's your channel?

482
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,180
Not even better.

483
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,580
It's like, you want to put your channel on your iPod,

484
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,580
you click a button, it downloads something,

485
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,140
you click it, it installs, it puts your channel on your iPod

486
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,660
with a smart playlist, the playlist, equal play count, equal zero,

487
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,780
all that stuff.

488
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,860
Get that, I'll pay you for it.

489
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,500
Now, of course, this is all about the channel editing functionality.

490
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,820
And I'm seeing some awesome channels popping up.

491
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,220
I learned, by the way, that by putting my channel feed into a grazer,

492
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,420
golfromio AlphaZuluRomio.com, a grazer widget,

493
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,740
it only takes one more click to put that widget onto my Facebook.

494
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,060
And I don't use Facebook at all, other than to test

495
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,060
shit out on Facebook and it worked.

496
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,700
And it's pretty, pretty freaking nifty.

497
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,060
But it's not, it's not really a fully released feature yet.

498
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,220
You know, remember, I'd kind of alluded

499
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,660
that we're keeping this a bit hidden.

500
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,100
It's not really hidden, but it's not in the logical places

501
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,100
where you might expect it.

502
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,300
And well, as one Charlie had found out, it's, you know,

503
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,460
if you don't know where to go, looking for the cheese.

504
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,020
Well, even if you're a rat, you can't find it.

505
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,900
Hey, Adam, John Arnold here from the photo walkthrough podcast,

506
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,700
out photo walkthrough.btpunchow.com.

507
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,260
Dude, just quickly on the subject of channels,

508
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,060
I've had channels on my pot show account since pretty much

509
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,140
our signed up with pot show, which is way less November, I think.

510
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,300
Anyway, so I really like the idea back then,

511
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,660
and I figured it long last, I ought to go in and have a go with this

512
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,580
cheddar thing.

513
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,380
First thing I did was go to the pot show website

514
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,660
and click on my collection at the top of the page,

515
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,060
because I knew enough about channels to know

516
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,780
that there were channels stuff mentioned in the collection page.

517
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,740
So I went to my collection, and I'm searching down the page,

518
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,620
and there's my channels there, and I can see the two channels

519
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,220
I created a way back.

520
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,060
And I can see an ad show button, and that pops up a little window,

521
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,540
that doesn't look anything like cheddar, and I can see a button

522
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,420
for adding a channel, and that pops up a little window,

523
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,660
that doesn't look anything like cheddar.

524
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,660
And if I click on the text from my channel name,

525
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,300
it says click it to edit this channel, and if I click on that,

526
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,220
it pops up a window that, guess what, doesn't look anything like cheddar.

527
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,660
So I'm sitting here thinking, how the hell do I get to cheddar?

528
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,460
So I start browsing through curie.com,

529
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,420
and I find your post new media, new pot show media channels,

530
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,820
and I click on one of those, and eventually I'm looking at

531
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,580
somebody else's channels, and I'm thinking,

532
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,580
you're hang on a minute, maybe if I click on the person's profile,

533
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,660
and then click on the view my channels button,

534
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,180
then I'll get to the cheddar thing, and guess what, that works.

535
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,140
So I just wanted to give you some feedback that.

536
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,820
You seem to have two interfaces to channels right now on the website,

537
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,220
and it isn't as in so many other things on the pot show website,

538
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,380
entirely natural or intuitive, how you might find these things.

539
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,940
So even though I've been a long time pot show user,

540
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,860
and even though I know the pot show website,

541
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,900
probably better than most, I still couldn't find cheddar,

542
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,060
not without having to do a lot of searching,

543
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,620
way more than your typical users going to want to do.

544
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,420
So I figured I'd just give you that little bit of feedback,

545
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,660
up to you whether you use it on the show,

546
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,700
but in case you do, repill.

547
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,740
All right, sir.

548
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,940
Yeah, back at your buddy.

549
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,460
Yeah, I'm not going to use that on the show because it's too embarrassing.

550
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,660
No, no, as I said, we purposely did not put it anywhere else.

551
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,900
The only way to get to the cheddar functionality

552
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,340
is go to your profile, click on my channels,

553
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,220
and then you'll see edit channel.

554
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,060
From there, you can also create a new channel,

555
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,380
if you click on the edit channels button.

556
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,380
That's the only way to get to it.

557
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,860
But it's also the best way to display your channels,

558
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,540
because that's where all your channels are in one beautiful place.

559
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,300
So yeah, of course, it's not consistent.

560
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,260
And we are working on changing crap around.

561
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,020
Had a very interesting day yesterday.

562
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,460
We found something really nice.

563
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,260
We found that a lot of the shows that we have.

564
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,740
In fact, just about every single show that we have on our network,

565
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,500
I'm talking really about UK only now,

566
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,260
because that's where I've been focusing a lot of my attention

567
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,980
for the past weeks.

568
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,180
There is a print publication out there that loves the content

569
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,220
that that show makes.

570
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,580
So the first example of this new thing that we've kind of discovered,

571
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,220
working as news of the world, huge tabloid, weekly newspaper,

572
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,580
9 million readers, really big.

573
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,620
And Dr. Cockney, as the editor's already had guessed,

574
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,100
completely resonates with their audience.

575
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,340
So we've struck a deal, and this deal is really, really beautiful.

576
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,740
All of these newspapers, all magazines,

577
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,740
they all want to get into the video game,

578
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,540
because it's really the only way they can differentiate

579
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,900
between what they do in print and what they do online,

580
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,180
which is still also just words and pictures.

581
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,180
But they're not set up to do this.

582
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,340
They have no department.

583
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,740
They don't, the bandwidth is too expensive.

584
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,740
You know, all these reasons, but they have the content

585
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,500
and the knowledge of what an existing audience already wants.

586
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,540
So we're forming these partnerships,

587
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,980
and the first one is with the news of the world,

588
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,740
and it's really awesome, because they get Dr. Cockney,

589
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,140
co-branded as a news of the world,

590
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,980
and they promote them in the newspaper.

591
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,780
And then obviously, we have to split revenue with them

592
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,100
on selling ads, but that's really easy.

593
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,780
So we're going to do two more with news of the world.

594
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,700
Yesterday, I met with the editor of OK Magazine,

595
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,660
who, by the way, is Smokin' Hot, 32 Smokin' Hot.

596
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,860
And this was very interesting.

597
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,100
So we went to her building this, the northern shell building,

598
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,820
whatever it is.

599
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,700
It's one big publishing conglomerate, Richmond Desmond, I think,

600
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,300
his name is.

601
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,140
And she said, OK, well, a glad deal here for the meeting.

602
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,100
It's like 130, right?

603
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,900
Just let's go.

604
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,020
So we went out.

605
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,460
And we had a meeting over a bottle of white wine.

606
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,300
And you know, you guys, you know me, I don't drink.

607
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,620
So I, you know, just to be courteous, I drank,

608
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,940
like a whole glass and a half, whatever.

609
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,060
Great meeting.

610
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,900
Totally understands it.

611
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,820
We have some shows that fit into her category,

612
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,900
and she'd actually like to create something with us,

613
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,460
fantastic.

614
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,660
Next meeting is with,

615
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,060
wow, it's a call, the Daily Express.

616
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,820
Another one of these fabulous magazines.

617
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,340
And they're looking at some other shows that we have on the network.

618
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,940
They'd also like to work with us on.

619
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,380
And again, the model is, you get the promotion in the newspaper.

620
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,820
The video lives on their site.

621
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,580
It also lives at VT Podgetta.com.

622
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,940
It's all served from the same place.

623
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,540
And we get just tons and tons of new viewers.

624
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,660
And it's unbelievable what's happening with the good doctor.

625
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,100
So the proof is in the pudding.

626
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,140
And then, oh, and by the way, had a beer.

627
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,580
Went to some terrace with this editor, had a beer.

628
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,580
And then the third one was this,

629
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,940
this is named Bill Richardson, I think,

630
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,420
a famous sports editor for the express.

631
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,860
I think the Daily Star was the other one.

632
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,220
He's the express.

633
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,660
Yeah, it was three o'clock in the afternoon.

634
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,380
Oh, let's go out and we'll have some spritzers.

635
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,660
It's like, it's like five o'clock.

636
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,420
It's like, I've done three meetings.

637
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,700
And I'm completely wasted.

638
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,900
And of course, it was a beautiful day yesterday.

639
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,620
So what happens if you, with me is like one glass

640
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,180
alcohol consumed at any time is going to make me woozy.

641
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,780
But then it's warm and you had like three glasses of alcohol.

642
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,820
But what a day.

643
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,060
And then I walked from like, God knows where I was back to the office.

644
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,860
Got lost.

645
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,380
You know, I wanted to walk in the streets of shortage for about an hour.

646
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,620
Finally rolled into the office around six.

647
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,780
You know, the people still work in there.

648
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,420
The portable airco units are on high blast.

649
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,060
You know, basically just recirculating warm air.

650
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,620
I had to take off my shirt and walk around my wife beaters.

651
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,340
It was that that disgusting.

652
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,260
But I'm very, very excited because it seems like we found some perfect matches,

653
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:17,220
some perfect partnerships to really, really get our network of programming out there.

654
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,540
And what a way to do it.

655
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,060
Never knew that that would work.

656
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,060
Very, very interesting.

657
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,780
So while I'm out here, shit's happening back state side.

658
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,500
Yeah, we had them.

659
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,020
This is John and K.C. calling a long time listener.

660
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,140
Um, do you have a brother in Kansas City?

661
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:39,780
Because I'm driving here and there is a red Chevy pickup with personalized license plates.

662
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,100
Like to say, pot father on it.

663
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,820
And the dude driving could be your brother.

664
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,140
He looks just like you and blonde hair.

665
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,660
That's kind of scary.

666
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,580
So are you actually just pretending to be over in England?

667
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,460
And you're actually here in the middle of America, uh, podcasting.

668
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,100
Hmm, conspiracies around.

669
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,740
Thanks a lot, man.

670
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,700
Let me show you how to talk about it.

671
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,740
Dude, dude, dude, get a picture already.

672
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,340
You got to get a picture of this.

673
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,020
This is unbelievable.

674
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,980
It's very possible that there's some guy getting late in Kansas City.

675
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:14,340
And, you know, identity theft is lame when you're getting late for it.

676
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,180
And the original identity doesn't.

677
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,540
That just totally sucks.

678
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,100
Get me a picture.

679
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,340
Kansas City, let's work on this together.

680
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:31,460
Hey, this is Ron from zip-71101 podcast.

681
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,940
So I'm glad that you are listening to Trucker Tom.

682

683
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,180
Not only that, have you seen Finding America?

684
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,620
His new HD high definition video podcast.

685
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,780
If not, you need to get on board.

See you there.

689
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,780
Hey, Adam, it's Matt from Games Weasel.

690
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,580
Hope you're well.

691
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,820
We've got two rhythm games on the show this week.

692
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,300
We've got Parapama, the rapper on the PSP versus Elite Beat Agents on the DS.

693
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,740
We've also got a great feature on the God of War game for the PSP.

694
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,340
And we're given away Final Fantasy Fables, Choker Boatails for the DS.

695
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,300
Check it out at gamesweasel.btpodshow.com.

696
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,540
Right on Matt, I like that show.

697
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,700
He's doing a video version too, which is going to be pretty cool.

698
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,100
Whole new type of format.

699
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,060
Very, very interesting.

700
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,100
Early in the week, I got a call from me.

701
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,180
It was last week, got a call from Guy and New Zealand who countered me by saying that

702
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,940
Australians are ugly and they sleep with their family members and with sheep.

703
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:48,260
And I parade and said, but no, I've only seen cute Australians.

704
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,100
Wow, I'll leave it up to those boys and girls down under to respond.

705
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,940
Hey big fellow, I feel Walker calling in from Australia.

706
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,300
I just wanted to take the opportunity to respond to the Kiwi who was on the DSC yesterday.

707
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,100
Let me just say this.

708
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,260
No, I haven't got a mallet.

709
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,540
No, I'm not ugly.

710
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,700
The maybe not as good looking as the big headfag.

711
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,020
Looking at my wife, she's gorgeous.

712
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,060
I couldn't want more.

713
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,780
Three good looking sons, not a mallet to be seen.

714
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,380
Mate, we're just typical Australians.

715
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,940
Not ugly, no mallets, just normal.

716
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,260
An idea saying most Kiwi's are just the same.

717
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,220
I've been thinking about your Kiwi caller and I reckon he's the guy he's been

718
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,540
causing with a trouble in the sheep paddock next door.

719
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:46,100
So Kiwi, believe those sheep alone, get down to a good Aussie beach or up into the mountains

720
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,420
into the snow and get it with some real good looking Australians.

721
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,420
You might just get a surprise.

722
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,180
Hey, have a great day.

723
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,620
Blue pill, but turning red, oh good, folder.

724
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,180
All right, man.

725
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:04,500
Yeah, there's always been a bit of an animosity between the Australians and the New Zealanders.

726
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,940
That's why he's calling him a Kiwi.

727
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,180
I love the, the reminding me of the pink Floyd song, though.

728
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:12,180
I was like, hey Kiwi, leave those sheep alone.

729
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,140
Damn, damn, did him.

730
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,500
I can just hear the recorders clicking on all over New Zealand as we speak.

731
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,460
Yeah, so I'm in trouble.

732
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,580
Come on on, man.

733
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,780
And prolific programmer.

734
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,620
Hi, I am prolific programmer.

735
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,060
Yeah, two things.

736
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,300
First off, one to express me condolences for Yan Polet sauce.

737
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:41,220
I mean, Yan, you're, you're like, you make the show more worth listening to.

738
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,620
Now, as would be every Friday with your, it tests nine joy playing along.

739
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,740
Second thing, Adam regarding the channels,

740
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,420
editor, your new cheddar feature.

741
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,420
I can't seem to figure out how to activate it on my channels.

742
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,500
That's all.

743
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,380
Cheers.

744
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,020
Oh, I prolific programmer in reverse order there, my friend.

745
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:05,220
If you have existing channels, then you have to do perform some kind of edit for it to kick in.

746
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,100
So click on, you know, go to one of your existing channels.

747
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,260
Move something around, move it back.

748
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,100
That's how you activate it.

749
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,500
Just have to make one edit, essentially.

750
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,380
There is no save button just with the minute you start editing it does it.

751
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,620
And then, you know, I've received such an outpouring of love and good thinking and

752
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:28,660
nice thoughts for a Yan Polet producer of the hit test for the daily source code.

753
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,540
He and his wife witnessed a real family tragedy.

754
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,100
They lost a, they lost a unborn baby.

755
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,420
And most comments that come in, people say,

756
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,540
well, actually, here, listen to this one and this is very, very common.

757
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:47,060
I've received a lot of these and I don't want to do a whole like, you know,

758
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,900
Yan, Yan thing.

759
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,660
But I do, well, listen to the comment.

760
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,900
Adam, I'm so sorry for Yan and his wife.

761
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:02,740
You recognize long and hard over when you can tell people about something like that.

762
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,740
And when you go public with the idea that you might be having a trial,

763
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,340
and I can only imagine how hard it must have been for Yan to finally come to the conclusion

764
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:17,620
that, wow, it's not gonna be safe now, I can tell people and then to have something like this happen.

765
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,780
I know that this is probably not gonna make the podcast, and you know what it probably should,

766
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:29,700
but I know that Yan is a friend of yours and you probably take form in the same way that I would

767
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,500
take for close friends, so I just want to take them home to say, I'm sorry for you,

768
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,300
and then for Yan and for everyone who's touched by this, and I hope everyone is well.

769
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,620
Thanks a lot, it's Bernie and I'll talk to you soon.

770
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,380
Oh, man, it's beautiful, thank you.

771
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,740
And, well, you know my theory about these things.

772
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,060
The good and the bad, it's documented in our memories throughout our lives,

773
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:55,380
and it usually happens through something that we call the soundtrack to our lives.

774
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,900
And I think that this next song is going to be embedded into this moment

775
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,140
and in my soundtrack forever. Jersey Todd sent this one, he says, Adam,

776
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,300
don't know if you want to check the song out, it's very sad, it involves one of my favorites,

777
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,540
Kevin Birdick who lost an infant daughter as well.

778
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,500
So again, thank everyone for all that outpouring of love, and let's make this a part of the

779
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,940
soundtrack to our lives in memory of Yan and Victorings' daughter.

780
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:42,660
Here in my eyes, in baby, sometimes it feels like I'm drowning.

781
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,980
The sea hasn't got me and I can't breathe.

782
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,980
I feel so helpless.

783
00:39:53,300 --> 00:40:01,940
She's so pure and so lovely, she's floating on my me,

784
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:07,780
to cut for this world, she's sleeping peacefully,

785
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:14,500
let's wait, she's dreaming on me, to cut for this world.

786
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:41,940
And somewhere, somewhere, the angel flies softly, missing her mother and I can't feel.

787
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:58,020
She's watching over and somewhere, a spirit is tossing and turning, waiting at one

788
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:03,940
to bring patiently, will we return?

789
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:14,020
She's so pure and so lovely, she's floating on my me,

790
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:23,460
to cut for this world, she's sleeping peacefully, she's dreaming on me,

791
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:35,540
to cut for this world, and the heavens and our fathers will look over home tonight,

792
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:49,700
and the hills are throughout her, so I'll keep in our warm with light, that's right, that's right.

793
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:03,700
You're so pure and so lovely, you're floating on my me, to cut for this world,

794
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:16,900
you're sleeping peacefully, let's wait, she's dreaming on me, to cut for this world.

795
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:35,380
For ever embedded in the soundtrack to our lives, Kevin Burtick, too good for this world.

796
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,460
You know, I have some other stuff I was going to play for you, but I think we should just leave it

797
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:45,220
at that, leave the last tones of Kevin Burtick roaming throughout your mind, because this is what

798
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:50,260
good friend of mine, Tony Khan, who does a WGBH morning stories and has been involved in this

799
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:56,820
movement from early on, would call humanity. Here we are, Jersey Todd, a guy, I don't know him,

800
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:03,140
I've never met him, I've never met John Palette in person, either. Listen to all these people connecting,

801
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,020
people who clearly are connecting at a very deep and very spiritual level with each other

802
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,940
through technology and through art, that we're creating ourselves without any other help or intervention

803
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:21,220
from any other organization or governmental body. It's a beautiful thing, if I never make a freaking

804
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:26,820
dime with this stuff, ever again, it won't make a difference because this, this is truly what it's

805
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:32,500
about, when you can touch someone through media. I'll try and do another one for you tomorrow.

806
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:38,340
I am flying tomorrow morning, taking the lovely lady Patricia to the Netherlands, so it will be

807
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:43,780
a late one, but at least I'm home, and I'm not in the city. DannySourceco.com, Adam at podshow.com,

808
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,100
kiss somebody today, will ya?
