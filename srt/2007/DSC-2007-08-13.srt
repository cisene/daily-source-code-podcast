00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, home fries and CC Chapman from accident hash encouraging you to check out BODOD.tv slash battle.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's one of the coolest battle events out there and you can only find it at BODOD.tv.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Delta Sierra Charlie, six five zero.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
With sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
With sixteen hundred dollars left to my feet high.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And the next and the daily source goes to my ears.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I like the big home drive it up don't worry.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But the nail is door-toed in my ears.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
My heart, the perilous day.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So, when you're not stupid or stupid,

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's true I'm in your hands.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I may not be a Christian but I've done all one man care.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I understand of my throne,

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
but all the flowers are gone.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So, when you're not stupid or stupid,

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's true I'm in your hands.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh...

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Took a sweet young fall in my gun.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And this lazy line is show right

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's nothing, nothing, no

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's ending

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Without the rest of the whole

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There you are, the day you break

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The sun was the change

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And such a star of the days and this

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Beyond the ruffle layer

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We'll do now sit there

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If it's true, I'll make your head

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm in a big Christian

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But I don't want to make him

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I understand him all the rule

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What all it was is wrong

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So we'll do now

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Sit there

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You'll be with your own

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
With your own

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You know, I'll say music that work

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Just never ceases to amaze a hero

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Show up next

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And we'll sit

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And Elton John

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You may do things to shut down the internet

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Together and do it

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We're to now see Peter

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Do myself

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And Wilson has apparently recorded her first ever solo

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Records titled Hope and Glory

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It doesn't come out until September 11

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Already two tracks on the pot safe music

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Network it'll be out on Zoe

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Rounder records

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Clearly some guys have got some vision

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Who put two tracks up on the PMN

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That is awesome

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And I like the song

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Actually she also released

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
An awesome version of immigrant song

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Which I think they mixed in pieces of magic man

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
From the old heart magic man song

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's fantastic

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You've got to hear it

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It is episode number 650

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Of the Delta Sierra Charlie

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And no one sent me an email about this

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It did pop up on one of those today in music history sites

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Actually I think it was a Dutch one

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's at August 13th

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
2004

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The very first episode released

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Of the Daily Source Code

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And I think that's right

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I believe it was a Friday

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
At the time it was a Friday the 13th

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It kind of makes sense since it was three years ago

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Three days ago

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, we jump ahead one day each year

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So yeah, it was probably Friday the 13th

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
As we rolled out Daily Source Code episode one

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Damn, wouldn't it be nice if I could find that very first episode

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You know what?

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I've got another song lined up coming up a little bit later on

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And I'll see if I can find it for you

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's a Monday

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Two more days until we take off for the family reunion

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But the portable mixer

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And the via laptop are going with me

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I will be doing shows from the road

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Since we'll be set up in a nice beach house on Fire Island

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So with Wi-Fi

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
They told me broadband

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So it may be hard-wired but who cares?

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll be connected

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Because I can't get through a week

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Without my hit test

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Or

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Without my ass or size

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I got to get tone note for the beach Amy

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I've got to give me something good

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Just the squeeze exercise

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey Adam, it's Amy Mack, how you doing?

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm okay

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm hanging it

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well today you're going to be lying down on your stomach

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm going to use a hate this

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay, I'm going to call it

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Go ahead and switch your microphone

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Get yourself all situated

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Let me get there

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Alright, you're going to extend your arms over your head

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Now you're going to raise your right arm

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And lift your left leg

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And of course you're going to be squeezing the butt

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh my goodness

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Now bring those down

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And lift your left arm

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And your right leg

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Good

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Now I'll do it quickly

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Back and forth

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Squeeze the butt

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And breathing

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Alright, my stomach hurt

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Alright

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Keep your head down

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So you don't hurt your neck

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Breathe

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Keep going

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes, yes

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Are you breathing?

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes, I'm trying too

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And done

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Very good

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Holy crap Amy

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Well that's it for me

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
My whole week has been through barred

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So I'm ready for some great music

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
To go into the weekend

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Until next time

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He told me

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
She meant this for Friday

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Sorry about your week Amy

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hope it got better

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm going to close the secondary mic there

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't get the fan noise

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Somehow the combination with the first coffee of the day

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And the assurse lies

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's just a bit much

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
However, I will say

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I went flying over

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is dumb

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I went flying over the weekend

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Saturday was

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Of course, a beautiful day

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Someday wasn't all that nice

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And knew that was coming

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Now as we're leaving

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I literally had about

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Two hours and 15 minutes left

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
On the clock or the Hobbs meter

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
As we call it

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
In the Delta Sierra

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
For its 50 hour

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Checkup

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Every 50 hours

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
As a certain type of checkup

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Done every 100 hours

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And of course there's the annual

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So it's time for the 50 hour

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
In the way it works

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
As I fly the plane to Antwerp

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
When Commander gets in

187
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Flies back with me

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Drops me off

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Or usually have a nice big

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
English breakfast or lunch

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And then he flies back

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And then sometimes when I get back

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
From the States

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
After the reunion

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He'll fly it over

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And we'll pick it up again

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And it was nice

198
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Contalia

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I mean it's fun flying with people

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Sometimes just being completely solo

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Just you, the elements

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The aircraft

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Of course the air traffic

204
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Of course the air traffic controllers

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's really just this romantic

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's beautiful

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I got admit

208
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Sometimes I dream of actually flying

209
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I know it's sad

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But I just dream of

211
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Take off some landings

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And flying over things

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And going places

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And it's

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I need more time

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And there's a woman

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Never cut that call

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And she's in the cockpit

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
7.57 on the ground

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
In Phosman, Montana

221
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You've been talking about your absolutely stunning weather

222
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What do you've had?

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Phosman Montana

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Two-Harmouth

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Physicality

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Absolutely stellar day

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But I am so jealous

228
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If you get so much flying

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Over there

230
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
In Europe and your plane

231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Did have a nice approach

232
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And to hear high

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Type worked out beautifully

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And I'm just sitting here

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Look on a glider flying overhead

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So

237
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Man, I'm right there with you

238
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Missed the flying

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Off to do it with you

240
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Someday

241
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
In the Delta Sierra

242
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Tailwind

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh man

244
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Of course

245
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Redpill

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I look forward to a robin

247
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This robin

248
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
From inside works

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And the diva cast

250
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And he is a pilot for major airline

251
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And he just calls in from time to time

252
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The cockpit

253
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
When he too is dreaming about flying

254
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a gene thing

255
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm telling you

256
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's something wrong with us

257
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
All right Adam

258
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I was listening to your show the other day

259
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And you and I have exactly the same problem

260
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
My old computer

261
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Was set up to log into the PMN

262
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Without any trouble

263
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And then when I changed jobs

264
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That computer was left behind

265
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
To PMN

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And I had lost the password

267
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So

268
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I clicked the button that said

269
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I forgot my password

270
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I figured it was going to walk me through a prompt

271
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It said

272
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A temporary password has been emailed to you

273
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
There's only one problem

274
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't have that email account anymore

275
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I can't get text for it to help me out

276
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So whatever you did

277
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Could you do me favor

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Could you tell them to come over and do the same thing

279
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
For Bernie's world on the PMN

280
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Because

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I've had to start up basically into account

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
In PMN

283
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And now I got two different playlists

284
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And it's a big pain in the butt

285
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Is there any way you can help me out?

286
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Thanks a lot

287
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, Bernie

288
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So there's a couple things that are going

289
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
A couple of threads here

290
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So there was

291
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
An I rate listener who called in on the footballer Friday

292
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Not just a listener but a producer of a show

293
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Who said I can't get the

294
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I get a new password cent

295
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This is for podshow.com

296
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's not for the pod save music network

297
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And it gets a new password cent

298
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Then it doesn't work

299
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Now I have my theories about that

300
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And it might tie into the PMN problem

301
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Here's what happened to me

302
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It was a little different

303
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
My account just was gone

304
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It seemed or

305
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Excuse me

306
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Kmart still got that back to school dot com special

307
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Back to school dot podshow dot com

308
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It seemed like

309
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It didn't even recognize the email address that I had registered with

310
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Let alone the fact that I could retrieve any email from it

311
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So I did the same thing dude

312
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I've created a new account

313
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And started you know link and stuff from there

314
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Which is not what I want

315
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Because I got my whole playlist history in there

316
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So I was reading through the email this morning

317
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
A couple of different things going on

318
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
One is

319
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We had to or have been having

320
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Intermittent problems with one of our

321
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Server slaves I think

322
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And you know essentially what each slave has to

323
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Understand is you know stuff like

324
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Login information

325
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And if it gets stock or doesn't synchronize

326
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Properly then of course it will still be looking for your old

327
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Password and hasn't seen the new password yet

328
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Or some weirdness like that

329
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So that's I think that was like web two or whatever

330
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So that's been pulled out and I think they're fixing that

331
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The pods and music network seems like there was some other issue at hand

332
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And the account logins just disappeared

333
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And so there I guess it's being worked on I'm not quite sure what the

334
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Resolution is everyone still asleep in San Francisco

335
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So I just kind of jumped into the email thread and I'll hear more about it later

336
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
As the day progresses

337
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But obviously yeah that does kind of suck I got a couple requests

338
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
From people who have exactly the same thing you they signed up in 2005

339
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And they've moved jobs or the email addresses have changed

340
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't really know how other companies do that

341
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
How they deal with that because it must happen a lot that people go through this

342
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So if you haven't experienced with you know with the

343
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It hasn't really happened to me but if you have any

344
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Best of breed ideas as to how that how that can be solved

345
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Or what people are doing out there feel free to drop me a line about it

346
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But it does it does obviously suck a little bit

347
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Let me see I'm going to make it a reasonably short show today

348
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You know not like 50 minutes or a full hour like I'm doing other days when I've been catching up

349
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Wednesday I think by the way we should be able to pump out a full show because we fly into the future

350
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We fly westbound so we pick up a couple hours on the way

351
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I think we leave it like 930 and we arrive at 1230

352
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And we should be at the beach house by the afternoon

353
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh man, I'm so looking forward to this is going to be awesome

354
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I got an email here

355
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Let me just see a little disorganized

356
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Wait a minute, a couple other things first

357
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh yeah, Gmail

358
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Years after I've asked for it have now made

359
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Additional storage

360
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Available for a fee

361
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I can get up to 250 gigs

362
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Which is nice

363
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah, I've been screaming for it for a long long time

364
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This was cool

365
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Dylan Alfred Adam was really nice hearing you chatting with Christina on

366
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Daily source code episode 648 it's been a long time

367
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I have a five year old daughter and a one year old son

368
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Every time I hear you on your show with Christina

369
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I feel like I get a glimpse of my future

370
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh and the Kmart promo worked

371
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
After listening to that little bit you did

372
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I jumped on Kmart dot com with my daughter Caitlin

373
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Who will be starting kindergarten in a couple of weeks

374
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And we found this great backpack slash lunchbox combo for her

375
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
For only 1199 mark down from 1999

376
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Which is more in line with the prices

377
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I've seen for similar items elsewhere

378
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Thanks as Dylan from Portland, Oregon

379
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah, well, dude, you know what

380
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
First of all, I appreciate the feedback

381
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And it's true stuff just works

382
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What's more powerful than a free roll

383
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Or some other form of 30 second eye

384
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This one sent in is something that's going to be on the

385
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Pot say music network today

386
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So let's check it out

387
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
David Usher and music

388
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Just let's sail in this shot

389
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Like the stars we're born and die

390
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Like these roses we all feed

391
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I can't see in the cars

392
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
On the free way below

393
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Lost in the music

394
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
On the foolishness of all others

395
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Dreaming out of control

396
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Lost in the music

397
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
In the music

398
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
In the music

399
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
David, please don't cry

400
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We can't out from your eyes

401
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We can't share some of it

402
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
There's no one in us in here

403
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
In the mirror, you're perfect

404
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Plastic flowers never fade

405
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We all turn the grey

406
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We've got to look close

407
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
On the free way below

408
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Lost in the music

409
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
On the foolishness of all others

410
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Dreaming out of control

411
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Lost in the music

412
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
In the music

413
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
On the swallowing out of steel

414
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
On the swallowing out

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And singing

416
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The music

417
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
David, please don't cry

418
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We can't talk from your eyes

419
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
We can't catch up on the bed

420
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No one is sitting here

421
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Bodies хорошing and shining

422
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Like the stars we are born and die

423
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Like these roses, we all feed

424
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's as we all feel

425
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You can't see in the cars

426
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
On the freeway below

427
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Lost in the music

428
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
All the foolishness of all our lives

429
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Dreaming out of control

430
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Lost in the music

431
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You can't see in the cars

432
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
On the freeway below

433
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You can't see in the lights

434
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And you're no better

435
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You can't see in the cars

436
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
On the freeway below

437
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Lost in the music

438
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And the music

439
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And the music

440
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And the music

441
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And the music

442
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And the music

443
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And the music

444
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And the music

445
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
All right, now I get it

446
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Meal beer scent this to me

447
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
There's always hooked me up with black lab tracks

448
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You always see so excited to tell you this

449
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You got to check the sky out as name is David Usher

450
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
There's a sold more than 1.3 million albums worldwide

451
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
He's won 5 Junos

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's the Canadian Grammy

453
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Including the 2002 pop album of the year

454
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Also in Canada he has 10 different singles

455
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That hold the number one spot on radio, 10 singles

456
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And the top 10

457
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
He's also had top 10

458
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And top 20 radio singles

459
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And what a nice list

460
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
England, Germany, Switzerland, Thailand, Malaysia

461
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And Indonesia, Poland, Russia, Hungary, Sweden, Austria

462
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Czech Republic is real Greece, Italy, France

463
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan

464
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But I guess that's what we're going for next

465
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And he grew up right down the street from Neil

466
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So we talked to him last week

467
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Twisted his arm and now this track

468
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The music from his album Strange Birds

469
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's pot safe, awesome, it should be up today

470
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Thank you Neil, yeah, great song man

471
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's been three years since I started doing this

472
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And look at what's happening

473
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
We're now playing songs from Anne Wilson, Elton John

474
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
David Usher

475
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But also all the ones we've grown up

476
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Within the past three years, shit's really happening

477
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
My friends, you know what?

478
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
There's no such thing as luck

479
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's just perseverance

480
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm still looking through my old dot MAC accounts

481
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Trying to find the very first daily source code episode

482
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Unfortunately

483
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
In three years time

484
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The one thing I've not been able to get out of podcasting

485
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
He's a good lead from it

486
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Well, except for the lady Patricia

487
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But I don't even get offers, you know

488
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You know Adam, Kenny from Northern California

489
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Regarding the DSC 648

490
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Thursday, you asked the caller

491
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The most important question was you didn't answer

492
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I was getting laid because of podcasting

493
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Like I literally know personally

494
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Not only am I getting laid more

495
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
than I was before

496
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I picked up a few tips

497
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
By listening to some of the sex podcasts

498
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You know sex is fun or let's get naughty

499
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And just the other night my wife complimented me

500
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Saying I had gotten better at whatever I was doing

501
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And I just told her it was a podcast

502
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So there you go

503
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It is working

504
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Fuck you later

505
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Not exactly

506
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Not exactly what I meant

507
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I think women who you already married do don't count

508
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Oh man, I'm talking like groupies

509
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
There's none of that in podcasting

510
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That sucks

511
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Hey Adam, this is Nick from Naples Florida

512
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You've been talking a little bit about the ZNTV experiment

513
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And so I finally decided a couple of days ago

514
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But I looked it up and that's I was kind of reading through it

515
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I realized this is

516
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Not unlike something that I do while I'm at work

517
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We have

518
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You know it's

519
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Don't know how much in detail I really want to go

520
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's a casino

521
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Basically

522
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So the TV is on but it's on mute

523
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And sometimes you have the closed captioned on and sometimes we don't

524
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Notice this is the experience is very very different

525
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
We have the closed captioned on

526
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Or I should say depending on whether or not we have the closed captioned on

527
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Without them it's extremely

528
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Disorientating

529
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You really have no idea what's going on

530
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And it affects everything

531
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It affects everything

532
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It affects the way you perceive

533
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Even things that aren't going on

534
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You're actually interacting with

535
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
With the closed caption you have a bit of a different effect

536
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's not

537
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
As disorienting

538
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But it's still you still seem

539
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Detached on what it is

540
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It definitely affects the way you

541
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The way you respond

542
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
To the TV show

543
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And I don't know

544
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll see if I can flesh this out a little bit

545
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'll call back another time

546
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Wait

547
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I think I understand what you're talking about

548
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But what you really need to do is take the ZNTV experiment

549
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I guess not to put that link in again because people are filing

550
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Catching onto it and doing it

551
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It'll really give you a whole different perspective on what television really is

552
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And what kind of tricks it plays on your mind

553
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And how hard your mind actually has to work

554
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
When parsing the information that television passes off to you

555
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's more work than you think

556
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
If you think you're just laying in bed

557
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And relaxing watching television your brain is actually an overdrive

558
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And you can tell what happens

559
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Guy gets completely fostered

560
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Can you talk anymore?

561
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You had another one from the Podsame Music

562
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That word Jersey Joe took this one up

563
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Buttered up on line

564
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's Edmund's Crown

565
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Keep Richard's is still alive

566
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Now that you've been told

567
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's time writing lies on the fat through the door

568
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's clearly a don't know what thing about rock and roll

569
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Oh

570
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm sorry, but keep Richard's is still alive

571
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
This is show some self control

572
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And we can stop putting stickers on trees like ours

573
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's clearly a don't know thing

574
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
About rock and roll

575
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Now you may not agree

576
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It just doesn't matter

577
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
If rock and roll the illusion to soon

578
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
To be shattered

579
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It sounds the bottom of the way

580
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But you need it as a taste around your gun

581
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm sorry, but keep Richard's is still alive

582
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm sorry, but keep Richard's is still alive

583
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So shut your life your whole

584
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And stop writing what's on the fat through the door

585
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It's clearly a don't know what thing about rock and roll

586
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Rock and roll

587
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Rock and roll

588
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000

592
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Rock and roll

593
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Rock and roll

594
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Rock and roll

595
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Rock and roll

596
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Rock and roll

597
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Rock and roll

598
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000

599
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Rock and roll

600
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Rock and roll

601
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Rock and roll

602
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Well, should be pretty clear

603
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Keith Richards is king

604
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Edmund's crown tells us all about it

605
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
They are on the pod safe music network

606
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I must say that

607
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Wait, wait, wait, first episode

608
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Hold on a second, I've just been searching

609
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Throughout the entire show

610
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Seeing if I can find

611
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Oh, ten, oh, man

612
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Oh, crap

613
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I just, no, I don't think I'm going to have any luck finding it

614
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Let me say

615
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
One result stored on your computer

616
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
No, crap

617
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Well, if you have that, give me a pointer

618
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And I'll put it in the show notes

619
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Okay, I don't even have my own shows

620
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I need to produce her so bad

621
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
All right, enough whining for me

622
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
We're going to have a great week

623
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's going to be fun and jam packed

624
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
With all kinds of jet setting things

625
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
As we fly off to the east coast

626
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Tomorrow, I'm leaving the beautiful weather in the UK behind

627
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Although I think we'll have some

628
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Maybe a thunderstorm later on the afternoon

629
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's going to heat up, I see some CBs forming

630
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
