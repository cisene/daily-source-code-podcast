1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Hey, this summer, when you buy coke for me, you'll get free tunes, that's right.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,720
I got a bunch of cassettes of guys from the neighborhood, they make some tunes, you get

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,920
a free one, you buy your coke for me, yeah, me go, what's the matter?

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,720
You don't like my tunes?

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,600
Maybe you want your tunes from Adam Curry on the Daily Source code.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,080
Okay, well, say hello to my little friend.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,080
That this year, try six to six.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:47,080
Hey, you don't put that dial in the DSC, so 46 is coming up.

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Six million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,080
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:01,080
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:11,080
I was reading in the shop, but back in Drake, you walked in and a new plot.

13
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Was it your destiny?

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,080
The words I grabbed left from my head, the letter said nothing to me.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:31,080
I've been trolling, I've been so transparent on the pitch, I couldn't see.

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,080
I asked if you liked Oscar Wilde, I'm drawing on comedy.

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,080
But what were you like as a child?

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,080
And did you feel the green?

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
But what's your main job?

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,080
And what's your main job?

21
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,080
And what's your main job?

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,080
And what's your main job?

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,080
And what's your main job?

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
And what's your main job?

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
And what's your main job?

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,080
And what's your main job?

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
And what's your main job?

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,080
And what's your main job?

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,080
And what's your main job?

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
And what's your main job?

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
And what's your main job?

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
And what's your main job?

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
And what's your main job?

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
And what's your main job?

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
And what's your main job?

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
And what's your main job?

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
And what's your main job?

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
And what's your main job?

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
And what's your main job?

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
And what's your main job?

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
And what's your main job?

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
And what's your main job?

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
And what's your main job?

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
And what's your main job?

45
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
And what's your main job?

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:55,080
So we may not have our giggles.

47
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,080
We've got Andy Stone.

48
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,080
When the pot saved music network in the coffee shop, when kicking off a

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,080
food bar Friday, more or less maximum music because, well, let's face it.

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,080
I crapped out on you yesterday, so all the stuff I had lined up for

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
today.

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
We're going to do today.

53
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,080
It is Daily Source Code 626 Apologies on Wednesday's show.

54
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,080
I said it was episode 626.

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
It's been one of those weeks.

56
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
It's been just absolutely crazy.

57
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Yesterday I went into the city again.

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,080
I met with the head of daytime programming for ITV.

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,080
We had some stuff we had to talk about, so very excited about that.

60
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,080
But really by the time I got back, which was five in the afternoon, this whole week I've

61
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,080
been calling our partners and producers.

62
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Actually, I've been having so much fun doing it.

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,080
We were thinking of calling the top 20.

64
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm like, fuck it.

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Let's just keep going.

66
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Let's keep going all the way down the line.

67
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Let's call everybody.

68
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
This is a lot of fun.

69
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
I've really been learning a lot.

70
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Great to have some feedback.

71
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,080
The network feels a little bit more like a network now.

72
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
So that's what I'll be doing today as well.

73
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,080
For the next couple of weeks, it's groovy.

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Learning a lot.

75
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,080
And producing some cool shit mode, which we're talking about later today on the football

76
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Friday.

77
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
But first, something we haven't done all week.

78
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,080
It's time to be the other microphone.

79
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,080
There's my girl, Amy Mac.

80
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Amy.

81
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
Hello.

82
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
Hello.

83
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Hey, Adam.

84
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
Hey, Amy Mac.

85
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,080
It's time to get that ass in gear.

86
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
Yes, I'm ready.

87
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
What do we do?

88
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
Are you ready?

89
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Yes.

90
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Just tell me.

91
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,080
Okay.

92
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
Today you're going to need a chair.

93
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Okay.

94
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Get your chair and get all situated.

95
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
Do I sit on the chair?

96
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Great.

97
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Okay.

98
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Sit on the edge of the chair and put your hands next to your hips.

99
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Your fingertips should be pointed away from the chair.

100
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Your feet should be at a comfortable spot in front of you with knees bent.

101
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
Yes.

102
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Now lift your booty and squeeze.

103
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,080
And come down.

104
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
Up.

105
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Squeeze.

106
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Yes.

107
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Don't forget to breathe.

108
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Can I go down?

109
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
Thank you.

110
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Oh my goodness.

111
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Last time.

112
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Oops.

113
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Up.

114
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Squeeze.

115
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
Hold it.

116
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Oh, man.

117
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
And down.

118
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Oh, man.

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Fabulous.

120
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
That's it.

121
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
You're doing so well.

122
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
It's smoking.

123
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
It really makes a difference.

124
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Doesn't it?

125
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
It sure does.

126
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
It's so proud of you.

127
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Okay.

128
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
On with food bar.

129
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
And until next time.

130
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Yes.

131
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
How are you, Amy?

132
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
I got to tell you.

133
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,080
You know, and since I haven't been smoking, the dreams are coming now at night.

134
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
That's always just, it always happens.

135
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,080
I start dreaming a hell of a lot more.

136
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
And yes.

137
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
You are in every single one of them.

138
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Games.

139
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
What's that?

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Come on.

141
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Hi, Adam.

142
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
It's Matt from Games Weasel.

143
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,080
On this week's show, I've got five copies of our victory for the Xbox 360 to give away.

144
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:54,080
So if you're into your first person, shooters and you're like your World War Two game.

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
This one's for you.

Don't know the show.

Have a listen.

149
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Answer the question.

150
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
And you can be a winner.

151
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Alright, Matt.

152
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Thank you.

153
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Amigo.

154
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,080
Oh, let's get into a matchup for the footballer Friday.

155
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
What do you say, huh?

156
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,080
You're going to like this one.

157
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Dr. Art sends it in once again straight to the heart.

158
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Oh, yeah.

159
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Oh, yeah.

160
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
Oh, yeah.

161
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Oh, yeah.

162
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
Oh, yeah.

163
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Oh, yeah.

164
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
Oh, yeah.

165
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
Oh, yeah.

166
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Oh, yeah.

167
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Oh, yeah.

168
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Oh, yeah.

169
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Oh, yeah.

170
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
Oh, yeah.

171
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
Oh, yeah.

172
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Oh, yeah.

173
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Oh, yeah.

174
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
Oh, yeah.

175
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

183
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Oh, yeah.

184
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Oh, yeah.

185
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Oh, yeah.

186
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Oh, yeah.

187
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Oh, yeah.

188
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Oh, yeah.

189
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
Oh, yeah.

190
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Oh, yeah.

191
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
Oh, yeah.

192
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
Oh, yeah.

193
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Oh, yeah.

194
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
Oh, yeah.

195
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Oh, yeah.

196
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
Oh, yeah.

197
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Oh, yeah.

198
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
Oh, yeah.

199
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Oh, yeah.

200
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I've got some towns in town that I can't find what I've got to do

201
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,080
I've got so desperate that I sent a rocket to them

202
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,080
No, you're serious, I'm upset, they saw you sang in the blue

203
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,080
I wasn't meant for nowhere, man, they look like you

204
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,080
I've got to keep such an eye, this feeling's much too strong

205
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,080
My heart is ringing, I'm singing this song for you

206
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,080
I've got to keep such an eye, this feeling's much too strong

207
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:51,080
My heart is ringing, I'm singing this song for you

208
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,080
My heart is ringing, I'm singing this song for you

209
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,080
My heart is ringing, I'm singing this song for you

210
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:08,080
My heart is ringing, I'm singing this song for you

211
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:28,080
So close to take so long So I've got to sing a song to let you know how I feel

212
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
What's the deal, baby?

213
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,080
I've got to wait for you I hope you make me feel

214
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,080
My heart is ringing so I'm tinging in this cycle

215
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Give me authority

216
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,080
For you, you never have to let me feel

217
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,080
My heart is ringing so I'm tinging in this cycle

218
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Hey, I hope you do it

219
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Make me feel

220
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,080
I love it.

221
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,080
I love it.

222
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Lula Placino.

223
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Orny has a damn thing.

224
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Of course, mash it up.

225
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Danny Warhol is a moose tea.

226
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
On D.S.C. 626.

227
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
While that was running, I was trying to load up

228
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,080
young Pulets hit test for this week.

229
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,080
And I think I've knackered the cast blaster.

230
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
It's not like in what I'm trying to do here.

231
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,080
There's an error in file or format and not supported.

232
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
Okay.

233
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Oh boy.

234
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
I'm just hoping this thing keeps rolling on.

235
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,080
Hey, you had a mix of Raymond and your buddy from the Netherlands.

236
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Ray?

237
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Oh, actually, no way.

238
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
An end of the unaffordable booze.

239
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
This is Raymond.

240
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
We were talking about him just earlier this week.

241
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,080
When GD called in about people listening to bite-sized bonus

242
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
at Glastonbury in the tents.

243
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,080
This is Raymond, who was listening to a daily source code

244
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,080
in his car while I was recording another one in my car.

245
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
And we were both in traffic.

246
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,080
I started my new job here two weeks ago.

247
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
And so far, so good.

248
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Got a new cell phone.

249
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,080
The Nokia E65 device, by the way.

250
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,080
I downloaded the podcasting application.

251
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,080
We're subscribed to the D.S.C.

252
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,080
Obviously, in order to be able to catch up.

253
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,080
I listened to it on the bus on the along the way to work.

254
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,080
And there was mention being counted.

255
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,080
We had almost three years ago on the Dutch A4.

256
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
It brought back all those good memories.

257
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
So thanks for that, Mike.

258
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
We keep in touch.

259
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
That's a say in Norway.

260
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Hard of it up.

261
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Hard of it up.

262
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
This is what they say in Norway.

263
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Hard of it up.

264
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Meanwhile, I'm trying to get shit organized here.

265
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,080
I guess I'll just have to play the hit test from the separate player.

266
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
That's hope that's over.

267
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,080
That's hope the cast blasts are hangs in there because well,

268
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
that is kind of par for a football Friday.

269
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
No, isn't it?

270
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Good morning, Adam.

271
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
See you soon, Farod.

272
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
It is Thursday morning.

273
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Nice morning here at Farod.

274
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,080
I'm ringing in really strong slate for my

275
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,080
combat fit, the prolific program.

276
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
I believe what he said was.

277
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
Oh, wait a minute.

278
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
This is indeed prolific programmer.

279
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Call then he said something about Tony Blair and Gordon Brown,

280
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
which I just, I couldn't understand.

281
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Let's see if I can find, see if I find this comment again.

282
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
May not be easy to find.

283
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
I get so much stuff in.

284
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
Let's see.

285
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
Hmm.

286
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Was it, uh, P.P.

287
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Ah, crap.

288
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Anyway, it was, I thought it was like the two cheeses of the same

289
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
something.

290
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
That's what I, that's what I understood in design.

291
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
The Gordon Brown and, um,

292
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Tony Blair are two cheeks all same back side.

293
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
In other words, they are like they are.

294
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Like they are.

295
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
Hmm.

296
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Possibly many others as well.

297
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Yeah.

298
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Hmm.

299
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Wait a minute.

300
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,080
Telecopter Day at Farodx yesterday.

301
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
There's lots going on, at least half a dozen,

302
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
Augusta 109s of different marks.

303
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Hmm.

304
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
There was a wonderful Bell 47,

305
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,080
registered D-Math and completely tricked out

306
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,080
as in Korean war, liver, even with the letters on the sides.

307
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,080
And somebody had one of those kind of whoops moments when they

308
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,080
would ground running a do-fap for engineering reasons.

309
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,080
And we were walking by and the, um, the floats will

310
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
deploy onto it.

311
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
We need to do that.

312
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,080
In fact, it's an engineering.

313
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,080
Uh, unfortunately we didn't do much fine because we can't

314
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,080
get our equipment to work properly.

315
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Yeah.

316
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Uh, that's an official aviation term, I'll have you know.

317
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Uh, that doesn't work.

318
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,280
Yeah, that's a very embarrassing moment when you accidentally deploy the floats on a helicopter

319
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,680
Particularly when it's on the ground and not near water

320
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,600
And that can be pretty spectacular if if the engine if the rotors are running that could be a pretty spectacular event

321
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,480
But oh, man, yeah, that's that's a very embarrassing thing. Thank you. Thank you so much for

322
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,120
For both the update the pharaohs update. I think I'm flying Monday

323
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,200
I'm gonna take the lady Patricia over to Rotterdam

324
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,760
She's gonna be there for a week of shows and show business stuff and basically leaving Christina and I

325
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,920
All alone

326
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,480
Yeah, of course that means I can geek out a lot more at night

327
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,200
And also for the two cheeks of the same backside. Thank you

328
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,760
We're in the middle of a bomb scare today in London pickadilly circus large portions of it have been roped off

329
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,920
Apparently some form of device was found maybe in automobile

330
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,880
They were taking a car away. I just saw on the news. It's it's 11 30 a.m. So

331
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
By the time you get the show it

332
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Everything may be all over

333
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,720
But the brand new prime minister immediately came out and said well, you know these are these are trying times

334
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,520
We're under constant threat. Thanks and we have to be vigilant and damn those brids are there you guys are a vigilant bunch

335
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,480
There's just just not a lot that's gonna slow you down and there's and what I like about

336
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,480
We've talked about this before with the seven seven seven bombings

337
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
There's not a lot of sensationalism

338
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,480
When you look at the news. Yes, everyone's following and there's coverage and then we're trying to get information

339
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,520
But it's just not a sensationalist and

340
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:21,600
It's not being taken to extrude the discussion is not yet taken being taken to extremes mainly because we just don't know what's going on

341
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:28,320
But it's certainly never a boring moment. What should we do? We can do yarn

342
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,560
Actually, yeah, I'll do a yarn. Let me get the sponsorship of the hit test out of the way first

343
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,560
This summer when you buy coke you get music

344
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,560
You can win an iPod or free songs on iTunes

345
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,680
So I think the way this works is you use a code that's in the cap of

346
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:55,040
Either the bottle top the cap. I don't know if it's on cans or not and you can win free tunes from

347
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
For my tunes. I think you can win a free iPod

348
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
What I'd like to know is have you actually tried this

349
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,280
Please

350
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,920
Give me a call. Let me know if you've had any success

351
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,600
I'm not a I'm not a soft drink drinker myself

352
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
And if we have coke then

353
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,920
You know we might have a bottle. I'll I'll look and I'll see if I have a code and then you look and let me know

354
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,000
Let me know if you've gone to the process and and if you want anything

355
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,120
All right

356
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Foo bar Friday. It's maximum music

357
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,280
There's only one thing that everyone really is always looking for it is the hit

Leyla Leyla maybe and the final one for this week

365
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:32,240
That's Wangchung. I know how record I think so the last was Wangchung

366
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,840
I don't know if it was Leyla or some other earthcraft and project and that's it did you get them no is number one

367
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
All right we got 1984

368
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Friends my revolution

369
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,760
I would die for you as number one in the hit test

370
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,960
Friends says answer number one

371
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,320
And this is from 1985

372
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,360
I'm simply red money's too tight to mention

373
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,560
We'll count for that

374
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Oh

375
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,320
Simply red and money's to tight to mention is answer number two

376
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,520
And it's is answer number three from 1984 as well when Chang

377
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
That's all right

378
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Answer number three Wangchung

379
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,920
And dance all days and that's it for hit test numbers 76

380
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,760
Next week I'll be back for a hit test number 77 but in the meantime you can find the answers to this hit test

381
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,080
And of course the iTunes links at hit test dot bot show dot com

382
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,440
Well Adam I hope you had them all there were not too difficult

383
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,040
Until next time hopefully next week

384
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,320
So until then take care and bye bye

385
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,080
Guys got the biggest balls in the business young pull out everybody with today's hit test

386
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,880
We're up to number 76 two stars for me today. I can't believe I got simply red wrong and it's so amazing to me

387
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:02,080
And the UK people think very differently about makehocnall then and they all call them ugly all the time

388
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,480
It has you know there's a whole thing with with red-haired people with redheads here they're ginger and they're like

389
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,600
Contagious and they're really outcast of society

390
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
It's crazy how that works here

391
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,840
Where I think Mikhocnall gets a lot of fucking respect in the rest of the world. He's done some great songs

392
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,480
He's done some and he's had some hot hot girlfriends too

393
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,960
Major props for that make okay, of course if we have a hit test

394
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,040
To the hardest working audience jersey time

395
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Yeah

396
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,360
How's it going Adam and Jersey Todd the official musicologist of the chacha

397
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,640
So dude, I was thinking this week one instrument haven't we hit on a football Friday yet

398
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,120
We've hit our cowbell we've hit our rock and region metal guitars and the one instrument the one instrument

399
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,920
Then I'm thinking that we haven't hit is the banjo

400
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:28,160
I think we need to hit the banjo this week because I've got a great great song the band is Ryan Schupe and the rubber band at a Utah

401
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,520
They've got a great great song up on the pot safe music network. He got to check this out. It's banjo boy by Ryan Schupe and his band check this out

402
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
That's like a hip hop banjo

403
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
You'll need this

404
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,000
When the banjo play the banjo play the banjo play the banjo

405
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
You see

406
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
I

407
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Have a little jet kind of limousine

408
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,840
Whenever I put my plans for screaming hey, I'm your boy

409
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,040
We love you

410
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Please don't think I'll ever expand you

411
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,320
And you'll see me on the TV talk show with day

412
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,400
Come have a jail and oh the only problem is I'll play the banjo

413
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,920
I'll play the banjo play the banjo play the banjo play the banjo

414
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:04,960
I'll play the banjo play the banjo play the banjo play the banjo

415
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll need a banjo

416
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,960
Todd once again you do not disappoint as official music colleges of the chacha

417
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,560
Ryan Schupe and the rubber band I'm the banjo boy

418
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,240
Direct from the pod save music network. You can find that in the show notes at daily source code dot cam nice

419
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,640
Nice nice nice and pretty excited later today

420
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,960
I'll be working on the new channels interface

421
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,920
That is still in the development sandbox

422
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,360
But yesterday I got an email from Devon Devon and Andrew and I are working on this couple other people and I'm not exactly sure who's who's all involved

423
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
I'll find out

424
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,800
It takes a lot of people to get this stuff on the live servers

425
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,800
But it's really

426
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,040
It just hit me like a like a fucking title wave yesterday when I saw the work that Devon had done now

427
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,400
I know exactly how we're going to make this thing fly and it's going to be a very interesting experience to mess around with

428
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,000
So you Charlie listeners

429
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,120
You will be the first one to be able to play with it because we want to push it public into the at a secret URL

430
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,160
That I'll give you and you'll be able to to mess around with it and and feedback so we can actually have kind of like an iterative process

431
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
It's going to be I think it's going to be very cool

432
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,800
I did want to

433
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,680
Mention something you know I've been complaining for the past couple days about cast blaster not working

434
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
You know it would report

435
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,120
No errors it would say look the show has been uploaded but it wouldn't appear anywhere on daily source code dot com and not just basically

436
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,760
It wasn't getting up to the server. We've seen this problem before

437
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
So we have an email list. We have a couple of them

438
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,920
One is the critical list and so what you know that's usually what I post my I would could I I

439
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,120
Think a cast blaster not working as a critical bug

440
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,600
So I I post a message and you know there's lots of people a jump on this this people are up 247 to monitor shit

441
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,720
And it's just it's it's great because I get fucking awesome customer service go figure

442
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,760
So they're trying to figure this out and it takes like two days and I'm uploading through the new flash interface

443
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,600
Exactly as advertised so I'm really happy with it, but still it's a copy and paste project from cast blaster into the web page and say

444
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
You know and it should work it should work perfectly

445
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,280
So we finally decided to do it because I did say a my defense

446
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,800
I said look I can't rule out that there's something wrong with my set of locally

447
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,840
Andrew Grummet had seen the problem occur once he thought

448
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:42,160
But our QA team could not reproduce the problem so we decided to try it out and what better way to try it out than

449
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
By doing a Skype call

450
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Brin and Andrew and and of course, you know, and actually I thought of it about two minutes into the test

451
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,720
I said well this is stupid

452
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,960
I should actually be recording this because I could let you hear how how we troubleshoot this stuff

453
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,480
So here's me

454
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,840
Andrew Grummet and and Brin so fuck Brin I know you last name

455
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,280
Brin is from ops and and we're troubleshooting

456
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,800
Okay, so tell me exactly what you want to do

457
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,040
Okay, um, so there's I think right now there's

458
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,520
Just basically have you do an upload again, but you know, maybe not your main feed so that you don't have to put other stuff in there

459
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,400
And we can just watch it and see so Andrew just said something really important here

460
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,160
He said upload something but maybe not to your main feed

461
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,800
Well, just look at people you can see something something in the logs indicate where the problem might be

462
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,120
Okay, so you want me to do this now you want me to upload this now from cast blaster

463
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Yeah, yeah, so um

464
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,440
Yeah, okay, hold on hold on

465
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Brin are you ready? Oh, yeah

466
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,520
Okay, I've got logs up. I'm watching just the access logs. Okay, watch show it first. We have to make a file worth uploading. So

467
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
I sure so

468
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,760
You sure are a pretty man at him. If I was woman, I'd have something for you

469
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,920
I should have recorded that bit wait. I'll repeat what I just said

470
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,280
I said oh shit. I just found the problem

471
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:27,600
And I have put the entire engineering staff of podgeo all of two wheels are in motion to satisfy my every demand

472
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
For a frivolous pursuit

473
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:41,120
Operations as well. I just noticed that in cast blaster the show that selected is not the

474
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,560
intended show that is the daily source code

475
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,680
Okay, just so should we go to the other show and see if it's there

476
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,560
Yeah

477
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,640
It's under a show called Adams family so I wonder

478
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,920
Let me see if you go to my profile and you can go to my shows

479
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,720
Where is it? Adam's family ID 1939

480
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,840
Yep going there

481
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,160
And yeah, you're probably gonna see three days

482
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,840
Yeah, yeah, today once from today

483
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
We

484
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
I am such a douche bag

485
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
You know I bet I bet you I did the same thing

486
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,240
Hey man did something reset maybe what does that happen?

487
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,080
There you go. I look like a pretty big fool. I have to say

488
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
It's one in from Marcus couch

489
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,920
My hands are

490
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Send the powder from Los Angeles

491
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,080
You might recognize

492
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
What is a much never-be

493
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,320
If I take it out of you

494
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,520
And if you say to me to my own

495
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,280

00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
And I've missed out my friend

497
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,800

Thank you Marcus College for sending that track along to me

521
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
Completely legal of course to play it on the show

522
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,080
But it's a full bar Friday, what can I tell you?

523
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
Marcus, another guy who I'm looking forward to talking to

524
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,080
I think we're scheduled to speak either next week or the week after that

525
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,080
I'm so happy

526
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
Oh shit, hold on a second

527
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
It's really raining now

528
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,080
I gotta close the window

529
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
Otherwise everything's gonna get wet

530
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
Hold on

531
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,080
So we meet my printer, we'll get wet

532
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,080
There we go

533
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
Yeah

534
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
Does somebody say something about

535
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,080
These conversations I'm having with the network

536
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
Because that's essentially what it is

537
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,080
And it feels a little bit to be honest with you

538
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,080
It feels like a

539
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,080
Almost like I'm calling the sales staff

540
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
I know that sounds weird

541
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
And I don't want that to come across wrong

542
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
But when you think about it

543
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,080
Whether we're converting customers for Go Daddy

544
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,080
Or whether we are trying to get

545
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,080
Customers for ourselves

546
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,080
Essentially we want our audience to work with us

547
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,080
To help us understand how to do better at what we're doing

548
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,080
And we're creating a company and building an industry at the same time

549
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,080
A true media industry, a parallel industry if you will

550
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,080
That's a sales job

551
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,080
Because it's almost like it's one thing to say

552
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,080
Hey, do you want a domain name anyway

553
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,080
So you can get it from me a little bit cheaper

554
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,080
That's easy, easy, easy sell

555
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,080
But then it's like, hey, I want you to take a survey

556
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,080
It's like, you know, could I just poke this knife in your eye

557
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,080
You know, it takes a real sales job

558
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,080
You have to convince people

559
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,080
And of course I want to convince my audience as well

560
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,080
And the reason why is because after we get through this initial survey

561
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,080
There's going to be a new one every month

562
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Which you can opt in or out to participate in

563
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,080
That's up to you

564
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,080
But you'll be testing new advertising

565
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,080
How a placement of advertising

566
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,080
We'll be talking about music and shows

567
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,080
Just tons and tons of information

568
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,080
And the size of the panel that we're building

569
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,080
Minimum 7000, we're looking for 10,000 people

570
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
Which I think we'll get quite easily

571
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,080
We're already well on our way

572
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
That is unheard of

573
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,080
That's larger than any any size audience that is pulled for presidential elections

574
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,080
Even, I mean, it's huge

575
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,080
Absolutely huge

576
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,080
And it's a pity because, you know, lots of people say, hey

577
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,080
All right, I took the survey, but how come you guys couldn't be

578
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,080
You know, it was so old fashioned

579
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
It was so traditional and you know what?

580
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
Yes, of course I hate that

581
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,080
The reason why it's very traditional

582
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
Certainly this first one is me

583
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
You'll feel if you ever done a survey

584
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
You can say, this is kind of like every other survey

585
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
I've done with little different questions

586
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,080
But you have to do that if you want to have results

587
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,080
That the advertising industry is going to accept

588
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,080
That has to be in a certain format

589
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,080
And it has to adhere to certain standards

590
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,080
That they wanted to adhere to

591
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,080
And in fact, we actually

592
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,080
The initial survey, I looked up a copy

593
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Just what the powder was playing

594
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Because I had sent it to Mark Nemkov

595
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,080
And I said, dude, let's make this survey fun

596
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,080
You know, so that, you know, we can have people laugh

597
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,080
And be entertained while they're taking the survey

598
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,080
Now we weren't allowed to do it

599
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Because everyone feared that

600
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,080
Because it's, you know, we basically put a

601
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Funny answer after each question

602
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,080
And the fear was, is that the results would be discredited

603
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,080
Because a lot of people may be put, you know, maybe

604
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Distracted by that

605
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,080
I'll just give you a couple of

606
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,080
So it's like, are you the number one, are you currently

607
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,080
Subscribe to any podcast within the magnificent

608
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Potion network

609
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080
A, yes, B, no, C, not sure D

610
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,080
What in blazes is a Potion network

611
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
And then question two, why the hell not?

612
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,080
A, I don't know, B, I don't know how

613
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,080
B, I'm not sure D, I've suffered several blows to the head

614
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,080
How do you typically watch or listen to podcasts?

615
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,080
A, on my computer, B, on an iPod

616
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,080
C, on an MP3 player, D on a mobile phone

617
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Or E, through the alien implant put inside my colon

618
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
During my abduction

619
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,080
You know, we had some fun with this

620
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,080
And I should put this up

621
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,080
It's like, how much do you agree with the following statements

622
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
About pod show?

623
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,080
A, my interest grows as I watch or listen to more pod shows

624
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
See, I get bored of this crap

625
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,080
And usually turn it off before it's over D

626
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,080
I look forward to the next episode of this show

627
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
E, I look forward to the next episode of the show

628
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
When I forget my medication

629
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
F, this is the kind of pod show I watch

630
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Listen to all the time, G, I like cookies

631
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,080
H, I feel that pod shows are informative

632
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
I spend a lot of time my basement alone

633
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Because the world is plotting against me

634
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,080
I mean, we had some fun

635
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
And when you read through this, you chuckle

636
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,080
Throughout the whole thing, but we weren't allowed to do it

637
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,080
So that's how we came up with the whole suckless idea

638
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
What we learned and I think

639
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
Well, obviously made some mistakes

640
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,080
What we learned is that it's far more effective

641
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,080
To have each independent producer or host or pod cast

642
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
Or whatever you want to call them

643
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,080
To communicate with their audience

644
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,080
In the way that they're comfortable

645
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,080
So even, you know, naming a promotion like this

646
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,080
Makes it very difficult for everyone to adapt that to their audience

647
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,080
So we're now doing something

648
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,080
I think is quite revolutionary

649
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,080
We are going to fully support with all of our resources

650
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,080
Each individual producers, many campaign

651
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Whatever they need, however they want it done

652
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,080
We're going to support it

653
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
If they want to call it something else

654
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,080
But we've all committed to try and convert

655
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,080
5% of our audience

656
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,080
Which would put us way over the 10,000 mark

657
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,080
But we can commit to converting 5%

658
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
To actually take the survey

659
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,080
Please don't just go to survey.podshow.com

660
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Go to dailysourcecode.com

661
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,080
And click on the link that I've put there

662
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Because I want to track my performance

663
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,080
And see how well I do

664
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,080
And asking all of you to do this

665
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Incredibly unfriendly thing

666
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
But it will get better

667
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
This is what I'm committing to you

668
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
Because you're going to be

669
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Seeing things happening in pod casting

670
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,080
First before they're actually exposed to a larger audience

671
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
So just like

672
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,080
I'm looking forward to lots of people working with us on channels

673
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
I'd like lots of people working with us on this

674
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,080
So that we can really create something

675
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,080
Something real intangible

676
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,080
That's going to stick around for a long time

677
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
A real industry

678
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
Now I spoke to soccer girl yesterday

679
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Very hard for me to talk to her

680
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
After the back and forth banter we had

681
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,080
I was kind of like

682
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
I don't know what to say

683
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,080
I love you

684
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,080
And she has her own ideas

685
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,080
Around a mini campaign to convert her audience

686
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,080
And to motivate her audience

687
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
To help us

688
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
Sockless

689
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
By taking the survey

690
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
Hello

691
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
This is soccer girl

692
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,080
Today I'm going to talk to you about a topic that's near and dear to my heart

693
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Sucking

694
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
Sometimes sucking works for us

695
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Like when we eat a lollipop

696
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,080
But other times

697
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,080
It works against us

698
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Like when we want to save that lollipop

699
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,080
Well now it's possible to have our sucking and eat it too

700
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Visit suckless.podshow.com

701
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Exactly the way I thought it should go

702
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Yesterday poor city PD launched

703
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,080
The season finale episode 7

704
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,080
And in July we're going to be kicking off season 2

705
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,080
And there's some startling revelations at the end here

706
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,080
Someone does get killed who you kind of wish wouldn't get killed

707
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,080
So it's very dramatic

708
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,080
And I really am so proud of this show

709
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,080
It is done on such a ridiculously small budget

710
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,080
I'm just ridiculously small

711
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,080
But we're very proud

712
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,080
In conjunction with 11 Bravo Productions to bring you poor city PD

713
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
It's a cop show

714
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
A cop show with no limits

715
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Because there's no limits

716
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,080
So some of it's pretty violent

717
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,080
But it's violent in a different way than you see on television

718
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,080
I think some of it's a lot more real

719
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,080
Some of it were not quite pulling off yet

720
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
But the story lines are there

721
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,080
And there's a mistake and there's

722
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
And the whole thing is just I don't know

723
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,080
It's kind of sexy

724
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Hi Adam it's Kevin

725
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Lawyer listener from Cambridge also from first person show

726
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,080
Listen to you

727
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,080
So watch the pod show

728
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
Cop drama

729
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
Last night

730
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,080
And just wanted to call in and comment on it

731
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,080
A couple of thoughts

732
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,080
I was really weird watching the show

733
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
Thinking this is an a TV show

734
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,080
With the limitations of what can happen

735
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
Of what the sensors you know

736
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
A lot

737
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
So I really was thinking about anything

738
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,080
Can happen there

739
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,080
You know same with it

740
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,080
Not being a movie and not wondering

741
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,080
No idea what rating it is

742
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
I thought that anything happened yet

743
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,080
And the thought of the cool show

744
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
Overall

745
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,080
The acting was good

746
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
The writing was interesting

747
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,080
You know, sent me an interest in

748
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
One of them maybe want to come back and check out more

749
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,080
So it's pretty very nice to do action

750
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,080
From sort of thriller drama

751
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,080
On to a small budget

752
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,080
Because you can actually see

753
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
The fight things

754
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,080
Look at the content

755
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,080
And it's where somebody's got blood on them

756
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,080
Yeah, you know

757
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,080
Some of the you're right

758
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,080
So what happens is you do recognize

759
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,080
Some settings and scenes

760
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
As like hey, wait a minute

761
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,080
Didn't I see it was not the warehouse

762
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
From three episodes ago

763
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,080
But there's this charm to it, man

764
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,080
This charm to it

765
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,080
And the blood thing yeah

766
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,080
That's like the biggest item on the budget

767
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,080
All these actors are in it for free

768
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,080
I mean, or basically for cost

769
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,080
Let's put it that way

770
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,080
And people love to have a listing in the IMDB database

771
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
Because there is a true production

772
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,080
And they're all professionals

773
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,080
Because they work on lots of stuff in North Carolina

774
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,080
You remember I went there with the

775
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,080
With Richard Brewer hay

776
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
And we hung out with those guys for a while

777
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,080
I mean, so this is part of the results of that

778
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,080
Is the continuation in season two of

779
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,080
Or poor city PD

780
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,080
But each time someone gets shot

781
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,080
You use one of these blood squibs

782
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,080
Fifteen bucks

783
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,080
You know, that shit starts to add up

784
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,080
When you've got a dramatic gun battle

785
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,080
I mean, it's amazing how

786
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,080
How spoiled we are

787
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,080
And high standards we have as consumers

788
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,080
Because I noticed that somebody would get hit

789
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,080
And then they would have blood on them

790
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Which you don't really think about

791
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,080
But I'm sure it's one of the budgets

792
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,080
It's budget problems

793
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,080
So maybe the radio, maybe the radio

794
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,080
Maybe the radio, maybe the audio

795
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,080
It's just that so much simpler

796
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,080
That can be easier to do

797
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,080
On a shooting

798
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,080
Or maybe we don't expect quite so much

799
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,080
But at the video

800
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,080
Or visual entertainment

801
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,080
The primary means of entertainment these days

802
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,080
We really do expect a lot

803
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,080
I don't know, maybe

804
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,080
It's too much to take on

805
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,080
Trying to do an action

806
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
Drama like that

807
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
But I'm interested to see

808
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
Whether you guys come up with anything else

809
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,080
Looking at the format

810
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,080
I'm sure there's other format

811
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,080
They would lend themselves even better

812
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,080
To a small budget

813
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,080
Yeah

814
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
So he was good work

815
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,080
I'm away in the work now

816
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,080
So I hope to hear you on the GFP thing

817
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,080
Thanks

818
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,080
Right

819
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,080
So you're saying something interesting there

820
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,080
You're saying that there may be other formats

821
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,080
More suitable to a lower budget

822
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,080
Yes, that's true

823
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,080
But I do like trying it

824
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,080
I think the budget per episode

825
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,080
I don't know

826
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,080
It's like a couple grand

827
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,080
It's really not a lot of money

828
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,080
But I think it can be done

829
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,080
And I think that

830
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,080
We're looking at a much smaller screen format

831
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,080
Typically

832
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
The way this is consumed

833
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,080
Although always keeping a bigger screen in mind

834
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,080
I think the writing and the production

835
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
And the special effects

836
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,080
They're already damn good

837
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,080
And I think that they can work around any problems

838
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,080
But you're right

839
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,080
If you look at CSI and Miami

840
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,080
Or CSI, any of the CSIs

841
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,080
That could be a million bucks in episode

842
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,080
Minimum, maybe it's more

843
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,080
So yeah

844
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,080
It takes a lot of people to make something

845
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,080
Really slick the way we're used to it

846
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,080
Sometimes we get a bit jaded

847
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,080
We don't think about how many people it takes to make a great

848
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,080
A great production

849
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,080
I'm just saying

850
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,080
So that's Port City PD

851
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,080
Link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

852
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,080
Hey Adam, it's Chef Mark in New York City

853
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,080
I was really bummed that you didn't play my comment last week

854
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,080
I sent in some information to the listener

855
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,080
Who was looking for cheap and fun things to do

856
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,080
In New York City

857
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,080
Well, maybe I don't remember

858
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,080
It was boring Mark

859
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,080
And it hit me

860
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,080
I got to play my theme song

861
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,080
That's what it did

862
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,080
She walks on the street

863
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,080
From Chelsea to Times Square

864
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,080
A personal chef

865
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,080
Without his cook

866
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,080
Where he tells his stories

867
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,080
With his main team name Steven

868
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,080
We've our remarkable Steven

869
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,080
We've our remarkable

870
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,080
We've our remarkable

871
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,080
Well it just so happens that I just posted

872
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,080
Remarkable Pout Podcast number 96

873
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,080
Which of course you can find on pod show

874
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,080
And that was my coverage of the Taste of Times Square event

875
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,080
That happens on restaurant row every year

876
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,080
And there I spoke to a number of restaurant tours there

877
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,080
And there's some good cheap inexpensive fun places to eat

878
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,080
One of them is House of Brews

879
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,080
It's right on restaurant row

880
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,080
And it's a beer hall that has over 86 beers

881
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,080
And so he should check that out

882
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,080
It's on 46th street

883
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,080
Also for cheap eats

884
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,080
There's Pam real Thai food

885
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,080
And that is right on 49th street

886
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,080
Between 9th and 10th Avenue

887
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,080
You can find it at Pam real Thai.com

888
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,080
And this lady is from Bangkok

889
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,080
I interviewed her for an upcoming podcast

890
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,080
They only accept cash

891
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,080
And is the most authentic Thai food in all of New York City

892
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,080
It's surely

893
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,080
If you like Brazilian food

894
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,080
There's rice and beans

895
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,080
Which is on 49th and 9th

896
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,080
It's a little hole in the wall place

897
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,080
But man it is the best

898
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,080
Brazilian food you will find in town

899
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,080
Now for diversions

900
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,080
Of course Brian you can check out the museum of sex

901
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,080
That's at 5th Avenue at 27th Street

902
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,080
It's only 14 bucks admission

903
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,080
Pretty cool huh?

904
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,080
14 bucks for all you can learn about the history of sex

905
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,080
So Brian

906
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,080
Before your trip

907
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,080

I've come to love you ever since you cooked for me

924
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,080
Understandable yeah

925
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:40,080
Yeah

926
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,080
Adam

927
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,080
Any from Berlin California checking in

928
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,080
A couple days ago

929
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,080
And I made a couple weeks to you

930
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,080
Are so

931
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,080
You played Howard Jones

932
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,080
Revolution in the heart

933
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,080
Right

934
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,080
I think it's what I just did

935
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,080
I downloaded our iTunes

936
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,080
To tell all those music labels out there

937
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,080
That you know podcasting really works

938
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,080
Especially when it comes to trying to push music

939
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,080
I just pay for this

940
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,080
Legally

941
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,080
And now I

942
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,080
It's mine

943
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,080
So

944
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,080
Talk you later

945
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,080
Hi man

946
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,080
And despite the fact that you're a scruncher

947
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,080
Yeah

948
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,080
You know we should stop and think about that once in a while

949
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,080
There's something amazing

950
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,080
Has taken place over the past couple years

951
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,080
There are now real vehicles

952
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,080
With thousands of people listening

953
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,080
That can be used

954
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,080
You know for marketing

955
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,080
Gee

956
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,080
Who would have thunk it?

957
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,080
So if you if you've got a band

958
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,080
If you have some tracks

959
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,080
And you want to expose them to the world

960
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,080
You know there's a lot of things you can do

961
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,080
Put getting up in my space page

962
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,080
It's probably the top of everybody's list

963
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,080
But throw some tracks up on the pod safe music network

964
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,080
Because this enables podcasters

965
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,080
And independent producers around the globe

966
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,080
To use your music

967
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,080
In their shows

968
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,080
To promote your music essentially

969
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,080
Because they'll play it they'll talk about

970
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,080
They won't play it if they think it sucks

971
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,080
You know and there's all kinds of specialty stuff going on

972
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,080
It's really beautiful to see this happen

973
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,080
And we just don't stop and I think

974
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,080
Look around us

975
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,080
Often enough to see how well we've done

976
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,080
You know look at all these connections we've made

977
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,080
I have friends that you have been friends of mine for two years

978
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,080
I've never met but I'm not just a friend

979
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,080
You know I'm a fan

980
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,080
Join me and GB and pod safe musician

981
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,080
And podcaster Matthew Ebel

982
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,080
For an informal Skype chat

983
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,080
On the chill cast with Angie B

984
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:39,080
If you knew what I did on a day-to-day basis

985
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,080
It's not a glamorous job

986
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,080
I know tell me about it honey

987
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,080
Driving for nine hours in New York traffic

988
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,080
It's not a glamorous job

989
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,080
Especially for when I did the show in drag and Pittsburgh

990
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,080
Oh yeah that would be a problem

991
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,080
Yeah

992
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,080
People wearing next to nothing all over the island

993
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,080
I mean like you know that

994
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,080
There's girls in bikinis and

995
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,080
And you just happen to be the key guy

996
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
I can't

997
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,080
Yeah

998
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,080
Well I'm the guy to pee on

999
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,080
Why will let them?

1000
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,080
Oh come on

1001
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,080
We all know that you're gorgeous

1002
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,080
Sally went

1004
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,080
Chill cast chat over at angiB.com

1005
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,080
So you know you hear a promo like that

1006
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,080
I'm thinking that's awesome

1007
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,080
Matthew Ebel's getting exposure to angiB's audience

1008
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,080
Thousands of people listening to the chill cast

1009
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,080
It's gonna do some form

1010
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,080
It'll bring people to gigs

1011
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,080
It'll move tracks

1012
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,080
It'll do something amazing

1013
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,080
We're doing it people

1014
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,080
We've pulled it together

1015
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,080
We're making it happen

1016
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,080
Wouting around the man

1017
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,080
Matthew Ebel on the show

1018
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,080
Sally went down

1019
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,080
Sally went down

1020
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,080
Sally went to savage

1021
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,080
Sweet southern bummer

1022
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:39,080
Every Sunday she filled her piece

1023
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:48,080
But you got, come with me, I'm not too happy now

1024
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,080
What's the girl like her gonna do?

1025
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:05,080
Saturday never made it to the road, never saw the night never even heard the drink coming

1026
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:12,080
Saturday only walked on the track, man, where the rails took a never thought to look back

1027
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:19,080
It's Saturday not the sea was doing right, but you went home, hurt it, but you never saw the light

1028
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:26,080
Never heard the drink coming, let it hit her in the back, Sally went down, Sally went down

1029
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:42,080
Sally didn't want to get involved with the scene before her

1030
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:51,080
Keep it down, walk it on the track, maybe they were just ignore her

1031
00:52:53,080 --> 00:53:00,080
But she kept her head down, she kept her head down, she kept her head down

1032
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,080
She didn't listen to the man before her

1033
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,080
Sally

1034
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,080
No, no, no, no

1035
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:24,080
Sally came down

1036
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,080
He said you had to leave your stomach, that would be a drink coming

1037
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,360
It's a dream coming when a theater in the night

1038
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,720
Saturday, we're in town

1039
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,720
Sally, we're in town

1040
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,920
Matthew, you evil, we're in the front of the show

1041
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,560
Sally, we're in town, you'll find him with the pot safe music network

1042
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,360
What day is it today?

1043
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,560
It's Friday

1044
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,320
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

1045
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,240
Friday, and a spinal fund for the week

1046
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,360
Okay, so maybe not so philosophical as I usually get on a football Friday

1047
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,880
So we bring you the final thought of the week

1048
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,280
But what I just said

1049
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,080
Kind of stuck with me throughout the song

1050
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,280
I was listening to Matthew, it's like

1051
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,280
You know, we just don't stop

1052
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,280
and count our blessings off enough

1053
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,440
Look at what we've achieved in a very short amount of time

1054
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,520
We've created an entire industry

1055
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,520
And you know, fuck community

1056
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,880
It's an industry going on here

1057
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,480
There's something that we can all participate in

1058
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,600
Whether you're in it to make money or not

1059
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,160
We've really done a lot, we've made a lot of great connections

1060
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,440
The connections being devices to content and

1061
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,320
Content to people and people to people and

1062
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,160
Music to programming, it's quite astounding really

1063
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,160
So what I'd like you to do is just

1064
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,560
One year next time you are listening to a podcast or watching something

1065
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,920
Cruise and around maybe you're messing around with your channels

1066
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,320
I'll be messing around with channels

1067
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,400
Just think about how cool it really is and that a few years ago none of this existed

1068
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,760
You know, we just we just take that shit for granted

1069
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,400
Way too quickly look at cell phones

1070
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,400
Fifteen years ago no one had one in fact if you had one you were kind of considered an arrogant ass

1071
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,880
And now look at it

1072
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,880
Remember those science fiction movies where one day we'd be walking around with little devices a

1073
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,880
Touch story here and we'd be talking to each other

1074
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,880
Uh, I think that happened

1075
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,320
Is Bluetooth earpieces? It's exactly what's going on. Oops, sorry

1076
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,760
Pilot error

1077
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,560
So you know, that's that's really groundbreaking stuff

1078
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,560
And there's a lot happening in what we're doing

1079
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,360
Independent audio independent video podcasting

1080
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,360
Created people getting their message out whatever it is

1081
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,760
So it's probably going to be a long fourth of July weekend for most in the states

1082
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,960
Of course I'll be here on Monday and on Tuesday
