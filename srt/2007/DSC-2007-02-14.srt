noise gate in real life on my voice oh we know I was thinking of installing one on you

50
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,480
I used to stop me a user configurable noise game not the whole point is it's actually supposed to

51
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,520
drive you to project more and to talk more into the microphone okay because let's be honest you

52
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,920
have a real issue with and I figured this out you have an issue with talking into the microphone

53
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,840
and I know why because you're used to singing into the microphone and when you talk you like

54
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,760
you pull the mic away is it light? how much says why? yeah yeah because you know nobody wants to hear

55

me talk yeah oh man you have no idea people love you oh okay people love you here check this out

be in your first matter hush baby hush Jersey Todd's here for you baby what you need to do is just

62
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,200
slip your man some folders coffee and some splendor and tell him to wake his lazy ass up all right

63
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:12,160
oh and Adam hey I'm not having anything with the animation you know how it is the ladies just love

64
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:20,080
music college talk you know as Jersey is a lawyer in real life yeah I would like to have

65
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,560
a lawyer like that apparently he's available all all the ladies love yeah well he's got it

66
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,160
now he's got a kid well he's available he's got a kid he's available he's got a wife he's got a kid

67
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:38,640

68
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,520

69
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,640
he's got a kid he's got a wife but why did you ask why did you ask it you said oh I would

70
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:56,640
like a lawyer like that well because I have experience with lawyers with bit voices very bad voices

71
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,320
I once had one bad voices and big bills yeah I once had one and it was a very

72
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,920
important day that day because it was with my records company and I did actually

73
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,120
I never met him was I in your life when this took place no and that was the day that I saw

74
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,160
my lawyer for the first time and it was in court so I sat down and the guy starts to talk

75
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:29,040
and he was not very basic okay for get about it yeah we really like that and I thought okay

76
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,680
we're gonna lose this really yeah with that attitude you will yeah and we did oh no

77
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,560
voices are I think it's so important sorry and a nice talking voice does mean it doesn't always

78
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,040
need to be beautiful but there is a certain timbre or something that's in the voice oh yeah

79
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,720
that is well look at Barry White I heard that a couple years ago how important Barry White

80
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,320
was for a lot of lovers what are we gonna do I mean it's very bad it's very white just

81
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,720

reached a haven of rest and order and it will give you a lift too after all catering for his comfort

97
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,280
will provide you with immense personal satisfaction yeah yeah and this is all they mean you know

98
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,120
when the man comes home absolutely well it's like it's not yeah when he comes home

99
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,760
is it all about when he comes home when he comes home and he had a very busy day this is what

100
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,280
you should do clear away the clutter make one last trip through the main part of the house just

101
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,960
before your husband arrives yeah gather up school books toys paper et cetera and run a dust cloth

102
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,760
over the tables do you do any of the shit huh yes I do it prepared the children for pair

103
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,720
the children with a little bit of herbs and time going to the room that's the only thing

104
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,920
that's take a few minutes to wash the children's hands and faces if they're small come

105
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,400
their hair and if necessary change their clothes they are little treasures and he would like to see

106
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,320
them playing the part minimize all noise at the time of his arrival eliminate all noise of the

107
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,680
washer dryer or vacuum try to encourage the children to be quiet as my favorite listen to him

108
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,720
listen to him you may have it doesn't important things to tell him but the moment of his arrival is

109
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,120
not the time now let him talk first remember his topics of conversation are more important than yours

110
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,560
oh he did the other way around really was it really like that yeah was it were your parents

111
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,480
yeah it was all about my my my dad he was the most important man or person in the house

112
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,080
but is this really bad I mean because of course everyone's laughing about this but

113
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,440
and I just say if if it were I think when someone is coming home from work from from a day of

114
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,160
work some of these things are okay I do the same for you I mean it's not like you know it's not like

115
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,480
it's a it's exclusively exclusive or anything yeah you know in the beginning it says be gay

116
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:42,880
oh really oh that's a very good idea yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah get yourself get another woman in the house

117
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,720
be waiting have have the kids playing their part yeah be a little gay and a little more interesting

118
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,920
for him exact his boring day may need a lift and one of your duties is to provide it that's right

119
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:03,200
by being a little bit gay pun so print this out for you would you like this yeah a hard

120
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,600
copy version of this isn't this funny this is so good but don't you remember those American

121

126
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,480

129
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,960

130
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,360

131
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,160

00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,360
curry manner which I think fits it fits as a manner doesn't it yeah it isn't that it's a wide enough

145
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,680
it's wide enough yeah what are all the viewers point of you yeah are you sleeping well

146
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,640
I think I faced the right direction the right direction with my nose yes what the hell

147
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,600
is that well sometimes you you feel that you're you're in the wrong position the wrong you know

148
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,240
the wrong way you should lay a little bit different but it felt right right you have good

149
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,880
bench we yeah it's very important to me but the biggest thing is you were bothered by the mobile

150
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,800
antenna the cell phone mask near the near the cottage so and and you were convinced that it

151
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:26,320
gave you back pain yeah more pain and and arthritis pain actually so well I think you think it's

152
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:32,800
a bit better yeah that doesn't happen well you know it's only couple of weeks that we are here

153
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,600
okay all right yeah I think I'm gonna and you know it's it is a beautiful neighbor

154
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:47,600
yeah sure we took some walks and it's amazing yes it's so green and all the the forest across the

155
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,360
street I mean it's where do you find that the forest and the paparazzi's across the street oh yeah

156
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,360
yeah they found us yeah that was pretty fun yeah yeah we don't know how here's how here's how

157
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,040
this works so you know so some pictures show up in a magazine the phone rings it's always your parents

158
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,200
usually your mom or your sister that's what I hear on the phone right and the first question you

159
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,920
say is how are the pictures yeah are the pictures any good how do I look how does the house look

160
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,640
is it nice is it look yeah yeah yeah we haven't seen it yeah yeah yeah because that's the way I

161
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,520
read these yeah of course you don't you look at the headline and then you look at the pictures

162
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,800
yeah absolutely and then next next one yeah I don't care yeah but I think they follow to Christina

163
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,840
probably followed it from home from school again yeah because of this time we know who the photographer

164
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,680
was he's actually a nice guy yeah so I don't care so actually the photographer did a very good job

165
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,880
did a good job yeah and the one thing we haven't well we haven't talked at all

166
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:59,120
is we have instead of a conventional oven and and stove in the kitchen we have an aga

167
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,360
oh man and we were a little worried I was very worried actually because this aga is like a huge

168
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,600
enamel thing that has four ovens and two hot plates and it's continuously on and and people say

169
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,520
you know oh once you've cooked on an aga you don't want to cook on anything else ever again

170
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,240
I didn't even know what to do with it I know and I was like oh course you're going to be freaking out

171
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,960
this is not going to work if you're not going to understand this was there in the kitchen has a big

172
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,640
monster it is certain of a monster it's real English and real cozy because you know yeah you

173
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,680
you sit next to this yeah big red monster so I got to tell you the shit you're making on it is

174
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:46,160
amazing it is it's almost like everything tastes differently it is so good there's something about

175
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,720
the way it heats everything I don't know it tastes better it just tastes better then more even I think

176
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,320
and it's beautiful the ovens are always on so you just pop it in the oven right away and it's always

177
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,560
the right temperature I don't know how the oven does how does he know that you know I don't know

178
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:10,480
I don't know it's always even right temperature and it looks golden brown it's beautiful you

179
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:18,560
have a cake oven underneath you have the meat and all the the poultry is the one above that

180
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,160
then you have the plate warmer you have the I don't know food keep warmer every single time you

181
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,520
take something out of that aga I'm like wow and we just thought heat is heat right yeah oven is oven

182
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,480
fire is flame is flame yeah who gives you shit and it's just and it's not true it really there's

183
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:43,120
something very different about it and simmering on it it's beautiful and it doesn't smell no it does smell

184
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:51,200
there they go they're just sitting in there and so the only thing you smell is when you take it out you

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:55,920
oh hey hey I haven't tasted no not yet no all right so what else is going on in your

202
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,280
well um you're on important life according to how's keeping monthlist you you may now speak

203
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,040
no do you know yeah I've told you that right that um because my parents were married in

204
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:14,240
probably no not not 55 when when did they get married I was born in I was born in 64 so they

205
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:21,600
got married around 62 or 63 there were a little bit too old to be hippies yeah but on the honeymoon

206
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,520
you you dad said you may speak no it was almost like that and my mom didn't tell me this until

207
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,560
a couple of years ago and it was really outrageous on the honey when they went to some golf resort

208
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,040
and so after the the wedding night which I'm trying to say I probably said to my mom how

209
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:45,840
was that and she probably said oh he passed out you know whatever okay he got up in the morning

210
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,080
he said okay I'm going to go off and play 18 holes of golf and he tossed newsweek magazine out

211
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,560
and he said underline anything you don't understand and I'll explain it to you when I get back

212
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,040
oh my god you believe that well they you know what you know what the future is going to bring

213
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,880
that's like the first day of wedding bliss that was a warning it's not amazing but and

214
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,200
but maybe it was just something from that time it was only a couple of years after this house

215
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,400
keeping monthly maybe that's just the way American marriages work back a day but in these days the

216
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,480
sixties we were actually quite liberating yeah yeah but you hold on a second I just got to

217
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,240
say goodbye to the serious stars one or two listeners you guys want to hear the rest of this

218
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,480
and thrall in conversation uh the sex part is uh later in the show yeah okay they're going

219
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,360
yeah so but you were younger you were 10 years younger they you know they were like getting married

220
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,840
and career and doing all kinds of stuff and you were you know you're younger you're 10 years younger

221
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,640
my dad and that's when we stopped wearing our bras and everything so I don't know where your mom was

222
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,200
doing but um my mom if she were here rest her soul she would say what bra you know that's what she

223
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,840
say yeah that's right yeah but I mean you know in the you know it's just saying actually but

224
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,880
yeah we did that's when the when the women just started to do whatever they wanted to do

225
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,720
so maybe that was the breaking point maybe maybe the old fashion I think my parents were probably

226
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,760
still in the old fashion side of the generation gap maybe that's still was going on but that's unbelievable

227
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:24,640
to me it really is unbelievable yeah because we had our our skirts real short you know and that's

228
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,880
when the power came yeah it's not amazing yeah we noticed that right away yeah like hey if you

229
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:39,120
show the boobies then men become stupid you take the bra yeah then you know short skirts and you

230
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:46,320
booties and you what booties yeah oh like a Nancy Sinatra type thing short short skirt booties

231
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,240

232
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:59,600
and boobies it's a winning combination booties and boobies get yours now yeah I heard about

233
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,800
that story from your mom and I think it's just amazing that after that she thought oh I got a great

234
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:13,600
man that's a fantastic item that's John and Ali from Swingercast are you know the Swingercast

235
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,320
no do you know what Swingers are yeah okay it's fun and intimate conversations about real

236
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,240
swinging experiences you know on a recent show Adam you play to comment from a caller who was

237
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,680
asking you a very important question about how many subscribers listeners does it take to have

238
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:37,680
a successful podcast and you answered one well Ali and I think the answer is two while there are

239
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,600
a lot of fun and exciting things you can do with one listener it is much more rewarding to share your

240
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:50,400
podcast with two can you imagine the possibilities with even more Adam Ali and I believe it's

241
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,640
very important to engage your audience and have them participate you don't have to fully swap

242
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,120
ideas with them but it's important to create an exchange and intercourse with your listeners

243
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:11,200
a couple may want to participate on a podcast or they might just want to sit back and watch or listen

244
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:19,600
the important thing is to just get it up and put it out there so keep it up Adam and I think you're

245
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:27,360
right reality is pornographic oh boy I think that was an invitation yeah it looks she sent you

I don't know if it's really you then take another naked picture with today's newspaper

263
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:33,760
kitchens what lore kitchens oh I think Laura is maybe from some Scandinavian place sent me this

264
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:41,280
link uh nearly one in three Britons think that if a woman jumps up and down washes or urinate

265
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:48,400
immediately after sex she can prevent pregnancy what yeah it's a survey uh string of revelations

266
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,600
in the survey carried out by the family planning association at the start of contraceptive awareness

267
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,360
week in the UK they reveal widespread confusion and misunderstanding about some of the basic facts

268
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,560
which is called and the FPS now called from proof sex and relationship education in schools

269
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,600
isn't that amazing that's amazing the survey showed that half the 500 people question did not

270
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,400
know that a woman's most fertile time is between 10 and 16 days before her period I should I didn't know

271
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,840
that um half of the 500 people so half of the people who took the survey did not know that a

272
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,120
woman's most fertile time so when you're most likely to get pregnant it's between 10 and 16

273
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,480
days before her next period I didn't know that well but the basically like so you're most

274
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,120
fertile in the middle yeah in the middle of it in the middle of that that really period that you

275
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,560
when you're not so gay yeah two weeks two weeks yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

276
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:50,800
once or 30 30% think if the woman jumps up and down washes or urinate immediately after sex

277
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,160
you prevent pregnancy well have you seen all the strollers and a teenager really she washed

278
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,760
she urinated yeah yeah she jumps up and down quite a bit god is not amazing yeah they need some

279
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,240

280
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,000
that statistic see and and then i'm very proud if i hear that Holland is very good at it

281
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,640
the teenagers in Holland know exactly is that true is that based on scientific evidence yes yes

282
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,440
even um little closer than like baby um i heard the Americans did the whole research and said

283
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,600
that the Dutch really teenagers and people were just better educated really yeah well i'm

284
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,320
I have to say in Holland it's like you know the human body is just another part of life and there's

285
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,200
you know you take off your top on the beach and uh no problem you could you could be mowing the

318
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,240
a prolific programmer excellent man all right so what else baby i'm going to a San Francisco on

Sunday yeah i'm gonna go away from you don't say that because all the man will come to i didn't say

320
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,000
which Sunday don't say um all the men will come to it what are you going to do in all the

321
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,320
men show up here at your door sign in my way uh really all of them all of them um i guess

322
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,880
well check them out first yeah a little little scan um i have a new camera for it oh yeah i posted that

323
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:41,680
on the on the web long it is uh it smells a little bit dim well it's a convertible

324
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,600
it smells tempi maybe somebody has i think it's been in the garage and i do what i have to do

325
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:53,920
it's it's a bit um uh it smells like a camping site yeah yeah and and wet tent

326
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,560
it is basically it's wet tent it has a tent cover it has a tent cover it was it rained this morning

327
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,760
this is why i don't like convertibles because the roof always gives you problems well it is not

328
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,040
wet on the inside but if you if you feel it on the inside it is wet you know what i mean

329
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,240
it's not wet on my chair it doesn't drip or anything do you want me to fix the garage so you can

330
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,080
put it in the garage would you rather have that because it is kind of a shame yeah but it is kind

331
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,720
of a shame to keep this thing outside i mean i know it's easy and everything but you know the roof

332
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,000
like that it will should have a car port a car port yeah i got to build a car port

333
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,040
you have you ever build a car port that's one that's hence my surprise yeah i didn't say you

334
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,880
have to build no i don't think that's possible but it should have a little thing over it yeah

335
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,680
well you could basically just throw up a shot but actually it dries really fast at the moment

336
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,240
the sun shines or you know the wind blows it's dry but i wonder if if i just can spray it a little

337
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,680
bit so that it's not oh with some kind of water proof stuff they're probably probably want you

338
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:10,560
to go by the the dealer asking because it you do smell it in the inside like a wet wet dog wet dog

339
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:18,560
wet dog it's just thing i say wet dog you say wet cat yeah all right darling so i'm i'm a cross

340
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,480
now you say that i'm racing through the neighborhood uh yeah you would call that crossing

341
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,960
you're mode of mode of crossing your way around yeah absolutely it's fantastic yeah it's nice

342
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,040
the turbo is good isn't it's great and when i hear you drive away i can hear but also you know

343
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:41,200
the thing is that you think you're driving your best you are because i drove behind you well yeah

344
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,960
I drove behind you it accelerates very because the hard ways nothing it's a thinking toy

345
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,480
i was gone before you know and it's like it has like three cylinders and 85 horsepower something

346
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,320
nothing it's like a lawnmower engine but because you don't weigh anything barbie turbo it's a barbie turbo

347
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,400
absolutely yeah it's not pink but it's a barbie turbo and i have to say uh guys i'm looking

348
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,520
now of course they're looking at you yep yeah i noticed that you look fucking sunglasses

349
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:30,480
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh hey what is that hey hey hey hey hey what the fuck is that and does that

350
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,400
actually work the guys ever get laid by doing this what i thought yeah i mean they wouldn't be

351
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,920
doing if they didn't think it worked i've noticed that a couple of times and i thought why you're

352
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,720
doing that so they do that they they turn up the radio yeah yeah and then you know and then they

353
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,120
they drive by and they look at you like it's new school we should come up with something for women to say

354
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,320
you know it's like so um so maybe if a guy pulls up next you at the stop light and he's going

355
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,720
you know and trying to get your attention maybe you roll down the window yeah but maybe it's a

356
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,880
certain woman that that they want to attract i don't know well but doesn't it attract me

357
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,960
and i'm a music lover well i'd like to know is there any woman out there there's actually

358
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,240
turned on by a guy doing that yeah and it doesn't matter and turning down the window even

359
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,080
well no so i think what you should do if that happens is you should roll down your window

360
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,920
wait for him to roll down his window and turn off the sound and say hey asshole

361
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,080
something like that or maybe like hey when your dick is as big as your sound system once you

362
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:37,440
give me a call yeah and then peel out oh very nice believe me well what else are you going to

363
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,320
do yeah all you had was hey asshole yeah that's classy all right women if you're actually turned on

00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,320
Oh, don't let Christina hear this.

440
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,320
She's over like, oh, woo.

441
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,320
Well, she's going out for Valentine's Day with a boy's friend in London.

442
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,320
What are you wearing?

443
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,320
I said, red underwear.

444
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,320
Oh.

445
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,320
Hey.

446
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,320
Oh.

447
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,320
Yeah.

448
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,320
Yeah.

449
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
Yeah.

450
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
Kids don't understand.

451
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,320
Putting on my red G string.

452
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
Yeah.

453
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
Uh-huh.

454
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
My string.

455
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,320
Yeah.

456
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,320
Show me.

457
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,320
Wait a minute.

458
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,320
Wait a minute.

459
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,320
Oh, okay.

460
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,320
There.

461
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,320
What's that?

462
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,320
Oh, yes.

463
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,320
There it is.

464
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,320
Very nice.

465
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,320
Mm-hmm.

466
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,320
And you have panties on too.

467
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,320
No.

468
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,320
Pandy house.

469
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,320
No.

470
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,320
I was going to say it.

471
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,320
Look like it.

472
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,320
How was that?

473
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,320
Show me.

474
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,320
Open that up again.

475
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,320
No.

476
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
There was my toy because it's so dark.

477
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,320
Oh.

478
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,320
Shit, man.

479
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,320
Yeah.

480
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,320
You've got a nice color.

481
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,320
I have a very nice color.

482
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,320
Especially for Valentine.

483
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,320
Oh, yeah.

484
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,320
Nice color.

485
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,320
Okay.

486
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,320
So, um, yeah.

487
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,320
So, I'm going to have to tell San Francisco.

488
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,320
I can't, uh, I can't participate in all the daily meetings.

489
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,320
Because, uh, I've got to, uh, I've got a, I've got a duty.

490
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,320
A big duty.

491
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,320
Yeah.

492
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,320
Yeah.

493
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,320
I can't be up until 11 30 at night doing, uh, need to shit.

494
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,320
And then I gave you a very nice card.

495
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,320
Yes, you did.

496
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,320
It said, let's, let's get dirty tonight.

497
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,320
Let's get bad.

498
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,320
Let's get bad if I said dirty.

499
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,320
Bad.

500
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
Uh, I thought dirty.

501
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,320
Let's get bad.

502
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,320
I know you had little devil horns.

503
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
Yeah.

504
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,320
Yeah.

505
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,320
With a box of after eight chocolates.

506
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,320
And after.

507
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
So, let's get bad after eight.

508
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
That's what it was.

509
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,320
It was the mess.

510
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,320
I, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

511
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,320
Mm-hmm.

512
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
Okay, baby.

513
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,320
Um, right.

514
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,320
Will you come on again soon?

515
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,320
Probably not until I get back from San Francisco.

516
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,320
Because, you know, it's, because tomorrow I'm going to London Friday.

517
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,320
It's going to be fucking hell.

518
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,320
Uh, yeah.

519
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,320
Okay.

520
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,320
But Friday, I can come with you too.

521
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,320
I'm sorry.

522
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,320
You can come.

523
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,320
I have to go to the dentist again.

524
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,320
Yes.

525
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,320
It's the never ending story.

526
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,320
I know.

527
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,320
You've got a car in the driveway and a Ferrari in your mouth.

528
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,320
Yes.

529
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,320
Absolutely.

530
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,320
I can actually, uh, it's a nice car part and a nice car part.

531
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,320
Car part.

532
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,320
It can drive my barbeque to my mouth.

533
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,320
All right.

534
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,320
I think no one needs to know anything else about your mouth.

535
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,320
Cool.

536
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,320
Thanks for coming on the show, huh?

537
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,320
Yeah.

538
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,320
Just mouthing is big enough for the both of us.

539
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,320
You do do do do do.

540
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,320
All right.

541
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,320
I love you, baby.

542
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:54,820
I love you too.

543
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,820
Another partial podcast.

544
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,820
Stick it in your ear.
