1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey Peyton Manning, that you won the Super Bowl, what are you going to do now?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I've all listened to the DSC 530 now.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
A $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We don't need no sticking trees, man.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm testing this out of the curry.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Where is he scenario?

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're not just now right out the window.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I have to hold my head just like this.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Even I won't go while I'm sinking.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Down in slow, there is only one thing you know.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You cannot beat the bad guy standing till two.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Where is he on the Super Bowl?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Where is he on the Super Bowl?

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Where is he on the Super Bowl?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
When you don't want to survive, it goes going

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When you don't want to survive, it goes going

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
When you don't want to survive, it goes going

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
When you don't want to survive, it goes going

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:03:09,000
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you, you, you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm gonna get here that bass line. You know that driving fun's got to come from one man.

25
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Munk, brand new.

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Here in it, before it's even on, the podcast music network.

27
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Awesome.

28
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's your daily source code coming to you from the Curie Manor,

29
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
from the affluent suburb of Suri known as G-Town, West Side, represent.

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's Monday, everybody. How you doing?

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, man. I cannot believe it. This free Trinity thing.

32
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I have so much material.

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And it's not just people calling in and writing emails about Trinity.

34
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's all kinds of stuff.

35
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And it's just like, all right, boom, all of a sudden we've got a whole bunch of

36
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
what we call this audience engagement.

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, that's it.

38
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You know, I had the perfect, I could do three shows actually.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
At three hour show is what I'm saying here.

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It would be a different type of show.

41
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And I play a lot more music and no one has time to listen that crap.

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But that's how much it's coming in.

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You know, I had a perfect, perfect weekend.

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And let me just tell you about it, brief.

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Before I get into that, do you hear that little, like,

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
horrible in the background?

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Part of my weekend was getting most of the, of Adam's attic all cleared up and

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and all the wiring done, etc.

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And I still have this just minor minor ground loop.

50
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And it's because of the second monitor that I've plugged in.

51
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That I'm now using because it's a lot better than the ground loop noise was before.

52
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I think somehow it's, it's interacting with the docking station for the

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
creative labs card that I have plugged in.

54
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I think it's just too much, too much stuff strapped on to the, to this poor

55
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Vio.

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But anyway, I do enjoy having the secondary monitors, so it doesn't bother you,

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
doesn't bother me.

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
All right, perfect weekend.

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let me tell you Saturday, wake up, Patricia and I were really early,

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
like it's 630 and was just a beautiful day.

61
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Five knots of wind, just blue sky, nice and crisp.

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And not a cloud to be seen anywhere.

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It was, it was just one of those fantastic days.

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It almost felt like it was, you know, like we're on a ski vacation in Austria without

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the snow.

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And Captain Dan and Hyde and I had agreed to do some instrument training.

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So I went to Farrowks rolled out the Delta Sheriff.

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Of course, he would call it in, said that she was looking pretty lonely and pretty

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
sad.

70
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And we flew for about an hour.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Now instrument training, it's really all about training your brain to

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
rest your instruments.

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's probably the best way to put it.

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And of course, learning to focus on these instruments and translate what you're reading on,

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
there's basically four major dials that you got to look at.

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But, you know, focusing on that while you're flying the aircraft and while you're doing all kinds of

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
other things like switching radios and checking your fuel, your engine, you know, all these things that

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
just have to have to take place as you're flying.

79
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And it's really, it's really millimeter work.

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You know, every little input you make makes a big difference.

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Because, you know, when you're looking outside and you're flying the plane, you know, it's kind of like

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and high and high.

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And I coordination.

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah, it's more much.

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And I coordination.

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And you know, you can, and it deviates a little bit.

87
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But when you're doing some precision flying, it's, you know, it's a, it's a whole different

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
ballgame.

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So what you do is you get these, they call them foggles.

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's basically like safety goggles, except you can't really see through.

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Like a little portion down near your nose, a lower part of your eye is, is actual into

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
the rest is all frosted.

93
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So you can only see your instruments.

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And even that's not not that easy to look at them because, you know, you got sunglasses on

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and then you got the foggles on.

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But you cannot see outside.

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And, of course, Captain Dan acted as a safety pilot and instructor.

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And then, you know, you know, make you do all kinds of things.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You know, turn and laugh.

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You have to do a standard rate turn.

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's like 15 degrees.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And it's really, it's a big challenge.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I caught it on pretty quick, but still, it's just going to take a lot of practice because,

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
you know, that's basically one part.

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But then, you know, you got to be changing radios.

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You got to be paying attention to what vectors you're being given.

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And it's all kinds of stuff that, that, that goes on.

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Very, very heavy workload, as we say in the, in the aviation business.

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So that was a lot of fun.

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Of course, it was nice move there, which is great because it's much easier to learn new things

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
instead of fighting the elements to keep the aircraft.

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Basically in the sky.

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And then we stopped, you know, before even went up flying,

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I had a big, big breakfast, which is the fair oak's airfield version of,

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
the full English breakfast.

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And it just, it was perfect.

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You know, like, oh, I feel great.

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I slept great.

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I was up early.

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Go flying.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We came back.

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We had a coffee.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Then we went back and we did another hour of training.

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You know, went home.

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It was, you know, it was nice.

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I had, oh, Christina was staying over at, at Indiana's house.

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So Patricia and I had the house to ourselves for the first time.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So, you know, we watched television.

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We laid by the fire.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You can use your imagination.

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But it was really, it was perfect, you know.

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And then Sunday, oh, I spent a lot of time cleaning up the attic.

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And I have, what is it?

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Probably about 15 boxes left.

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We'll really get in there.

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And you'll see it.

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll take some pictures.

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll put them up when I'm, when I'm ready.

139
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And today, it's, well, back to the old, back to the old grind, which, of course, is,

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
got that, I don't know about that ground loop noise.

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's pretty irritating.

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Maybe it's, it's not, you can't even hear it.

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Maybe it's just in my headset, who they'll know is.

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And of course, last night around 11 p.m.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The Super Bowl kicked off, which was being carried live by ITV in the United Kingdom.

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And I have to say, ITV completely fucking ruined the whole experience.

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You idiots.

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Ah.

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
They so misunderstand what the Super Bowl is about.

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's not a sporting event.

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I mean, this is really Yang's versus the Brit stuff.

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We got some more of that coming up too, by the way.

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's not just a sporting event.

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You know, it's like, who, and the UK gives a shit about the teams.

155
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's a show.

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's a whole freaking show.

157
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And please, in the show, you need to include the commentary by the American commentators.

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You need to include the American commercials.

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's part of the show.

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And so they have like their own guy.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And yeah, yeah, it's, you know, two American guest hosts on.

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But, you know, it was silly ass lame set.

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You know, a lot of, a much more background noise than any other booth.

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You know, just a little puny chairs and just dumb chatter, you know.

165
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And jokes, you know, and kind of like Terry Wogan.

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yang's you won't know who he is, but Terry Wogan makes kind of like,

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you know, comments about the Eurovision song contest.

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, it was a little bit of that vibe.

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I was like, oh, man, you're fucking ruining the whole show.

170
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Did you see how that thing started?

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I mean, to have Billy Joel go into the, or as the UK ITV1 presenter said,

172
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Billy Joel.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Billy Joel.

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And you can tell really bothered me.

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And it really ruined the experience.

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
A lot of the experience.

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Billy Joel finishes the, the anthem.

178
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And was it five jets?

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Fly right over the stadium right on cue.

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I mean, that's masterful, man.

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That is only, that is show business the way I think only Americans can put it down.

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It was, that was awesome.

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And then the half time show with Prince.

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And I got to tell you, I've been a huge fan of Prince for many, many, many, many, many years.

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I've met him, he's an awesome guy.

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And, you know, he's, he's one of us, man.

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He's against the man.

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You know, he, he told Warner Brothers records to shove it.

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That was that whole, the artist formerly known as Prince thing, you know.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And he went out on his own and he, and he, and he does his own thing.

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And he's very successful.

192
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And he kicked ass and to sing purple rain in the rain.

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It was just awesome, man.

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It really, really was.

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And I love the, like the, the phallic, good, well, like all guitars of phallic, of course.

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But, you know, with the shadow and all that, that was pretty cool.

197
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I presume they showed that in the U.S.

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But anyway, so actually watched that this morning because I was so fed up with, with the, with the ITV1 coverage.

199
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You ruined it.

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You completely ruined it.

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's a whole show.

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You can't just take one piece of the show out.

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's not the way it works.

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I understand, of course, they have to sell their own commercials.

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'd rather watch some stupid extra commercials just to see the commercials that came out in the U.S.

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Which apparently I haven't seen any, you know, any blog posts about anything spectacular or fascinating.

207
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I thought, I did Apple doing ad.

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Someone told me they were doing an ad.

209
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Go daddy ad was okay.

210
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I think the outtakes and the legal stuff or legal stuff, the band stuff that didn't pass.

211
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I thought that was better than what really made it on the air.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So anyway, so as I said, perfect, perfect, perfect weekend.

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Hennem, this is Chris Christensen.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I wanted to send thanks to you and to the gang at Potcho for the sponsorship from Sheraton that I had for my show, the amateur traveler that happened in December.

215
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I just spent the money and I thought you might be interested in knowing that I did two things.

216
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
One is I gave an iPod shuffle in a contest to my listeners to thank them for their faithful patronage.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And the other one is I just bought tickets to Istanbul to go visit a exchange student we had from Turkey who lived with us for a while,

218
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
who has been bugging me to go and see him for quite some time.

219
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm told his father keeps saying that my brother is coming, my brother is coming.

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So I thank you all for enabling that trip to happen.

221
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I hope that we can manage to support my travel habit and the fashion to which I'd like to.

222
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
In the future, thanks again, or as I hope you say interchish.

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Saloon and host Chikolene, or thank you and goodbye.

224
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Excellent.

225
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah.

226
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Well, you know what?

227
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You don't have to thank me, man, because you're building your own property there.

228
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You own media property.

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's what we're trying to do.

230
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And I love the fact that you reinvested it.

231
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And I'm sure you're going to do not just the reinvestment on the iPod shuffle that you gave out,

232
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
but I'm sure you're also going to do something with your visit to Turkey.

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You know, I'm just hoping that I sent an email to Barbara, the Polo Alto podcaster.

234
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And let me see.

235
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay, yeah.

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I was supposed to call her at 2.30, but man, it's already 3 o'clock.

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm telling you, it took so long to prep this show.

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Because of all this awesome stuff that you guys have been sending in.

239
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And not just about Trinity, of course.

240
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Dude.

241
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Greetings from Finland.

242
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You asked about how to pronounce Nokia correctly.

243
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes, usually it's almost right.

244
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's Nokia.

245
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Not Nokia.

246
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Not Nokia.

247
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Not Nokia.

248
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But Nokia.

249
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Simply.

250
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And easily.

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's from Finland.

252
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So am I.

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So this is Hessu.

254
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What's faster himself?

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Long time Charlie.

256
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Love her.

257
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Finding up.

258
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Bye bye.

259
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Nokia.

260
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Nokia.

261
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Everybody say it now.

262
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Nokia.

263
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Damn, as you could paid for saying that.

264
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And now we're from our sponsor.

265
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's the Yanks.

266
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Versus the Brits.

267
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
We'll drive each other crazy.

268
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But everybody knows that it's apparent to see.

269
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Let's just like you and me.

270
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's the Yanks.

271
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And the Brits.

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The Yanks.

273
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Versus the Brits.

274
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Mind the gad.

275
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And this is Nick from London.

276
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I've been listening to the show for about 18 months now.

277
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Quietly.

278
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Without engaging or providing feedback.

279
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Normally because although I have an 8-erge,

280
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
pedant that I am, to correct you on certain points or engage in debate.

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
There's usually another pedant out there who's far more able and keen and willing to do so.

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But something's been driving me nuts that nobody else has picked up on.

283
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's that letter of the alphabet that comes after G.

284
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
For some reason, you've got to the deer head that was Brits say,

285
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
H.

286
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, you know, and I'm so happy we're going to,

287
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Would you someone picked up on this?

288
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You Brits do say H.

289
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I hear it all the time.

290
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
In fact, I've heard it so much that I decided to adapt to it.

291
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Particularly now that I have a H.D.

292
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Because even when I called the Sky People,

293
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The Sky Satellite people, you know, when I said,

294
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I got an H.D. by what kind?

295
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What?

296
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
An H.D.

297
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What?

298
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
H.D.

299
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Ah, you have a H.D.

300
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So a lot of use are saying it, okay?

301
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And it's it's H.

302
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You're right first time.

303
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Clearly you've heard some people say H.

304
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And assume that we all do it.

305
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Well, we don't.

306
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Or if we shouldn't.

307
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Well, but, you know,

308
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I hear a lot of television too, man.

309
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And if it's on TV, I'm going to presume that everyone kind of does it.

310
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's the same as, um,

311
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Well, I know this is wrong, but the TH here in the UK.

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh, man.

313
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Doesn't that drive you guys nuts as the originator of the language that you continuously pronounce it as an F?

314
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah, if I hear Keith one more time on East Enders, I'm going to kill myself.

315
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
People do I admit, but it's just plain wrong.

316
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But there is something slightly odd about the way we tend to use that letter in words in this country,

317
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
this country, in my case, being Britain.

318
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If you're desperately portion, perhaps have a received pronunciation,

319
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
you would generally drop the her sound from the start of the word,

320
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
only when it's prefix by the word A, or as it would become Anne.

321
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I was staying in an hotel, or you might describe

322
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Trinity's room across America as an historic event.

323
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But curiously might celebrate the event by having an extra portion of herbs on their pizza, not herbs.

324
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That said, if you have a bit of an extra accent, perhaps you're a cocky, or for less.

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Wait a minute, I'm confused now.

326
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Is it the holy herb, or the holy herb, or the...

327
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What am I supposed to say?

328
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You might naturally drop your hues anyway, regardless of whether it's prefix by A or Anne.

329
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
For instance, you might stay in an hotel, Danny East End, and perhaps if it's a particularly historic event,

330
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
have some herbs on your pizza, night.

331
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Where, of course, I would stay in a hotel, and even if it wasn't a particularly historic event,

332
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
probably still have some herbs on my pizza.

333
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Anyway, glad we got that straight, so it's hd from now on, please.

334
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Well, okay.

335
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Hd from now on, then, if anyone disagrees, let me know, okay, because I want to do it right.

336
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But there is one slightly more serious thing I'd like to pick you up on, and that's your friend Trinity.

337
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Now, I really don't want to piss on your chips here.

338
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That might need some explanation, and he acts for us as the Brit's moment.

339
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But this idea of taking Trinity across America is, in principle, great, but you need to be very careful about how you portray this.

340
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Particularly if you start shouting out about Trinity's green credentials.

341
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The green thing to do is not to drive her anywhere, because as soon as you take her anywhere, she's producing green house gases as she burns fuel.

342
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Sure.

343
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm not necessarily trying to play up the green thing.

344
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm not even against big oil.

345
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
In fact, I think big oil is doing a fine job at getting oil, keeping those running.

346
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Again, those profits, they're reinvesting them. They really aren't. They have to.

347
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But that'll be it. You know, that's for the next 50 years, and then we're done.

348
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's more about independence, freedom, free Trinity.

349
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:54,000
She is producing less of a negative impact than the equivalent journey in a petroleum diesel or petrol based car, because she's not as dependent on petroleum.

350
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But nonetheless, she is producing greenhouse gases.

351
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Is that true?

352
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Does the vegetable oil produce greenhouse gases? I'm not so sure about that.

353
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Same don't do this, but just during the trip, don't proclaim some great green credentials, which really don't bear close examination.

354
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
For instance, you might want to promote the idea that by drying Trinity across America, you've converted a number of people to buy a diesel.

355
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And thereby reduced overall a dependency petroleum based car.

356
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah, I appreciate it. I appreciate the pronunciation, correction, and the thought about Trinity.

357
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
No problem, and as you'll see here, coming up, it's not about the greenness. It's about the independence.

358
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Now we're from our spine here.

359
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's the yanks versus the brits.

360
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows that it's apparent to see.

361
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Let's just like you and me, it's the yanks and the brits.

362
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The yanks versus the brits.

363
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Mind the gap.

364
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm just looking at, oh man, I'm looking at all the Gmail.

365
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's too much. I'm telling you it's too much. This one's awesome.

366
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This came in. Who's this from?

367
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Sinclair.

368
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Sinclair says, uh, perhaps this is a true metro sexual moment.

369
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And he sent a link to an article, which I've got to put into the show notes, a daily source code.com.

370
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
A new product is enough to make your hands stand on end.

371
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's a new hair product. It's bullseeming.

372
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
An upmarket hairdresser is taken a leaf out of Cameron Diaz's book.

373
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This is from Metro. This is a free newspaper, Metro.co.uk.

374
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Of course, making the comparison to something about Mary.

375
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They give you a 45 minute intense commissioning treatment used using

376
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Thurabred Seaman from Aberdeen Angus Bulls at a farm and treasure or the Cheshire.

377
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm really, I'm really worried. Now I'm at pronunciation.

378
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Hey, it's said to offer the ultimate shine for 55 pounds.

379
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Uh, Harry's H-A-R-I.

380
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
In Night's Bridge, London is the hairdresser who is offering the streamer's combined.

381
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The organically produced Seaman with the root of protein-rich plant Katera.

382
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The mixture is massaged into the client's Othsexy.

383
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The mixture is massaged into the client's hair after it's been shampooed.

384
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Then the customer has put under a streamer.

385
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So the treatment penetrates the hair.

386
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Finally, it's blow-dried.

387
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This is supposed to be really good.

388
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Let me just copy this link here for a second.

389
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Send that to Patricia.

390
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Hello.

391
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Adam.

392
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Is your drugs London correct?

393
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh, man.

394
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's him, Charles. He's calling in and he's drunk.

395
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Uh, hello.

396
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This is Charles, your drunk London.

397
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And I am.

398
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You said the other day, Charles, why don't you find out, don't I?

399
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Been at the waiting to unleash the drunk in the...

400
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Oh, yeah.

401
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Here I am.

402
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Sydney at home just got off the tube.

403
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And I am drunk.

404
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And I'm happy for it.

405
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And I've got so many barking, barking, so many topics to come.

406
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You know, this is what I love.

407
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
They say children and drunk people tell the truth.

408
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This is what I love about Charles.

409
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He's not afraid to experiment.

410
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I mean, I've been taking notes.

411
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Like, um, five, three, five.

412
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Jade, goodie.

413
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
She says, H.

414
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Uh, no, no fucking, no one says H.

415
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's not an English thing.

416
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
There's a H.

417
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Now I'm completely convinced.

418
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's not H.

419
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Fuck that.

420
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
H.

421
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
H. D.

422
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Not H.

423
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But who says that?

424
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
A horrible, yeah.

425
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Who's used me on burping?

426
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm burping.

427
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm just saying.

428
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm probably saying, I'm just saying.

429
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, I dropped my snooze.

430
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm a London man who's just about to...

431
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I don't smoke, but I take snooze.

432
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
When I go to Sweden, I love the Sweden.

433
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm a Sweden file.

434
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I love the Sweden.

435
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Anyway, yeah, H.

436
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
No, but that.

437
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Some people say H.

438
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
If you want to hear more from Charles,

439
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
the drunken Londoner, and you're listening to us now in serious stars.

440
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So, uh, 102.

441
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You'll have to go to dailysourcecode.com

442
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and download the rest of the show.

443
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The horrible, not H is what it is.

444
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Um, look, I go to one of those real quick.

445
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Go to Australia.

446
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It's fucking amazing.

447
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Go to the Witt Sunday.

448
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Really.

449
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
There's a fan features.

450
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Beautiful crystal clear water.

451
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Oh, it's still out on the boat.

452
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I see what he's doing.

453
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
What he's doing is he's going through all the shows and he wrote down notes when

454
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
everyone was listening and now it's all coming out.

455
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Okay, I gotta go to Australia.

456
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Let's clear.

457
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Go Anna?

458
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And I big, big fucking Lizard.

459
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Amazing.

460
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Okay.

461
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Next.

462
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Well, you know what, I could just round the line.

463
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's boring.

464
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You're listening to me.

465
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You're going to blah, blah.

466
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
That's it.

467
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You're playing the comment.

468
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Um, so, you know what, I'm just going to all write an email

469
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,140
or I would call you a comment, lots of video comment or something. But, um, food

470
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:22,440
congratulations on becoming a homo, uh, homo, no. Um, coming down.

471
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,720
Sounds very London. No, man. A boy, son.

472
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,360
I fucking miss a regular more man and now bitch. That's not good is it.

473
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,280
I mean, he sounds London. They were sound like a queen.

474
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,520
He sent, he oops. He sent something wrong there. He sent in an anecdote, which I'll

475
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,360
say for another day, unless you luckily broke it up into two parts. Lots of people

476
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,080
who haven't heard from in a while are calling up, uh, member, uh, Pablo called in from

477
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,760
Ecuador. Uh, and I said, you know, how are things over there? And, you know, how's the

478
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,320
government and how stuff going? And, here he is, uh, Pablo Ecuador.

479
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:08,240
Hi, Adam Davis, Pablo from Ecuador. I'm going to some terms that bathrooms, especially from

480
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:15,040
government, uh, places. I really, really nasty. People here is really, really bad.

481
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,480
I guess that's just from here, but from all around the world, people are really,

482
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:28,720
really nasty. They do really bad things in bathrooms. Uh, just to say hi, I, um, my wife called

483
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:36,960
last time, but she had problems meeting the message. Uh, she is her name is also Patricia.

484
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:45,200
So, bye. Guy, Pablo Ecuador, everybody. Kind of like that plan words, Pablo Escobar,

485
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,800
Pablo Ecuador. Yeah, man. I, I think I might be missing some, uh, some voicemail messages,

486
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,360
because Rosie, uh, said she phoned in with the report on Trinity, and I haven't seen it anywhere.

487
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,160
I usually that stuff comes into my, uh, into my Gmail, and I all, well, I, I know what I'm

488
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,160
going to get next from her because she said, hey, man, I got to go to, I don't know, it's San

489
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,560
percent of Barbara or Monterey. I don't know, she was driving somewhere, like a 500 mile

490
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,880
round trip. And I think she left yesterday and it's coming back today. And she asked if, uh, you know,

491
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,880
that, now the Trinity was back up to cruising speed. If she could take her on this, you know,

492
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,160
more or less a test run. And I said, yes. So, you know, we're going to have a, uh, a little chat

493
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,800
about Trinity in a couple of minutes here on the show. Hopefully, she's still doing well. And I said,

494
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,200
well, of course, I said to Rosie, I said, well, of course, you can borrow Trinity, uh, under the

495
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,040
condition that you do a video podcast. So, we'll have that to look forward to. For sure.

496
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,280
Um, okay. Let's see. Oh, yes. Oh, this is also, man, people are really digging this thing.

497
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:59,280
Thank you, Jeff. Let's see. Yep, it's, uh, it's definitely catching on. Brian and

498
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,720
Nigmas says, hey, Adam, I'm writing to say that I totally agree with you on the subject of

499
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,480
posh pigs in the potty. But I do have to draw your attention back to the century thing. One of the

500
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,800
colors and DSC, I heard talking about the phantom shitter, you suggested posting a century outside

501
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,400
the bathroom. Well, that's exactly what some of the poshists of posh bathrooms have. I bet you've

502
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:24,640
been to a restaurant country club or nightclub. Uh, let me see. Yes, no, no. Uh, I don't go out anywhere.

503
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,800
Uh, uh, where there's been some dude standing by the sink ready to hand you a towel. Sometimes

504
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,120
they even have mince hair products. Uh-huh. I got some great hair products for you now.

505
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,240
Shots of espresso, even. Well, middle class folks like myself are left scratching or heads

506
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,320
wondering, should I have tipped that guy? The club owners are left happy with the satisfaction that

507
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,240
this guy is the bathroom police. It's hard to take a dump in the urinal. P on the wall,

508
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,320
string up toilet paper streamers or etch your name into the mirror with that guy there.

509
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,880
I'm not that I've tried or anything. I'm just saying. And honestly, I've seen the same kind of bathroom

510
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,920
monitor station in restrooms of even more shady night clubs, presumably to ensure people aren't having

511
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,400
sex or using drugs in the bathroom because no club owner wants the publicity or legal hassles

512
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,120
of someone ODying in their club. That's right. Now, I'd rather have people shit on my walls.

513
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,080
So it does appear that there's some habitual shit here. So to speak that we need to talk about.

514
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,200
Did you dare in the office? Laurius even? A beautiful place. Going with the buildings completely

515
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,680
full and sitting all detail. I think it's sort of same from the yellowing gulfed. And I'm just

516
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:39,120
calling him with another comment on, apart from how it sits, he may be crisped out with by now,

517
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,760
but here's his on the me, right. So I still work for a national news paper, the broad tea variety

518
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,160
and instrumental stable. And for me, first news is developing a nest. The old building

519
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:56,880
grazing rate, in a converted sort of way, I'll say, all one is to keep sleeping prisoners or something

520
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,960
in many years ago. And in the ravages there, over the walls, at a fairly rough surface. And there's

521
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:10,240
one person who has to stand up, right to lose the content of his muscles and leave it stuck to

522
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,800
that. Speaking of that, it's under wall and everywhere, a week and a month that grew into

523
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:34,800
a lot of things. It's so totally, totally nasty. And of course, the next part of our discovery

524
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:40,960
into the topic of our posh people, pigs is, is this a male poshness thing or a female poshness thing?

525
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:51,440
Hi, Adam, it's CG here with a report on that are people, posh people, potty pigs. I've just talked to

526
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,600
the contracts cleaners of the place where I work and got a report from them that women are the

527
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:05,600
worst, especially those in the fancy mull gowns. They're a report state, but as well as the usual

528
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:16,240
vomit and two smears on all surfaces, these women leave the nicarus or panties, if they're

529
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,280
in the American, it must not be hindering all over the place and right to read messages with

530
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:29,360
lipstick on the mirror, etc. Which brings me to another point that James from Newcastle was saying

531
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:38,080
that men are the worst, actually reminded me of a story about German block of flats that was

532
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,400
being refurbished and many of the toilets the pipe work had to be replaced because they were

533
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:51,840
corroded, but not all of the pipes in all of the flats were affected. After some investigation

534
00:31:52,160 --> 00:32:00,800
was found that in flats where women only lived, the pipes were not corroded. It was mainly due

535
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:11,520
to men and after the pipes had all been fixed and redecorated, the men were asked to sit

536
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:20,160
to pee and this became a movement in Germany, forgive the pun, called sit-son, pinkland. There's

537
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,080
a sign which can be seen in many guest houses and hotels in Germany now. Gentlemen,

538
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,560
can I suggest that in order to save some of the mess that's created in the bathroom,

539
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:43,040
a new probably will notice it unless you've actually taken the trouble to clean up the bathroom,

540
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:56,560
much of us can be avoided by sitting to pee. I know it sounds a bit girly, but there you are.

541
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:04,000
Go to hell. There you have it. Holder. Uh-huh, of course. Excellent bathroom habits.

542
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,600
All folders have them. Well, this is fascinating stuff. I'm very glad you in lighten us with

543
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:19,280
this bit of information about sets in tinkland and I think I might give it a go. At this point,

544
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:26,320
we have new toilets in the curry manner and two of them have not have to be re-adjusted because

545
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,320
the lids fall down which is a real pain in the ass and if you don't watch it, you can be a pain

546
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,200
somewhere else. It's like it's a two-hand operation knowing when I go for a slash.

547
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,080
So I don't have an extra hand to hold up the lid. And now that I know this,

548
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:48,160
maybe a Petr- the lady Petrish has been asking me to sit down when I pee for 20 years and I just-

549
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,680
it's hard, man. It just doesn't feel right. It feels- yeah, girly isn't the word. It just- it feels-

550
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,680
I don't know. It's like unnatural. I haven't been doing it that way.

551
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,200
But I'm willing to give it a try now that I hear that because, well, clearly, we'll keep the value

552
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:10,080
of my home up there. Hey, it's not just in Europe in the United States that the

553
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,720
posh people seem to have issues. Why it even takes place in Asia.

554
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,120
Adam, hi. It's Melvin from Seoul. You're also about the Asian men rooms habit as well.

555
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,920
Asia's a big place but here in South Korea, let's go get used to the cleaning lady,

556
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,880
wandering around where you're standing and studying the quality of the tiling.

557
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,200
Which fabric would come at her? You don't start to wonder. You think Korean men have a size problem

558
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,120
because it's all over the floor. You get so close that I haven't taken a leak and they back away

559
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:46,480
to give her a shake and it goes everywhere. Oh, right, mess. You could do a whole pod show,

560
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,280
literally a whole pod show on the ins and outs of Korean men's bathroom habits. If you want to

561
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,360
know more, give me a call. Take care. Oh, man. You gotta give us the ins and outs of Korean men's bathroom

562
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,160
habits. Are you kidding me? That's awesome. This is this is fantastic news. They step back and

563
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,000
give it a shake. What's up with that? I think we have a lot of investigating still to do on the topic

564
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,840
of our posh people, potty pigs. Our posh people pigs by godly goshit is a fine question. Yes,

565
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:24,000
it is our posh people pigs. Sorry, little miss fire there.

566
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,000
One Jess Smith after another.

567
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,200
All right, finally sorted it out.

568
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:02,800
Trinity Trinity. Oh, yeah, baby. Check this one out. I am pretty much convinced that any egg

569
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,600
non-colored Mercedes diesel has been at one time a taxi in Germany. This is still the default delivery

570
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,800
for taxis and I often asked myself how this particular shade was picked, surely not as the

571
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,720
result of a popularity contest. Be that as it may, since the free Trinity project may well be

572
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,920
crossing the bomb to blighty. I'd suggest you think about going a bit further to Germany in fact.

573
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,440
Trinity comes home. I think the idea would resonate with the German media.

574
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,920
It's Trinity's tour, it'll cut down the boulevard of Berlin. The ranks in the DSC audience could learn

575
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,480
a little bit about how the German greens rose to exert influence on society and the government

576
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,000
as far back as the 80s. German fans of the Charlie, and I'm sure there are a good number,

577
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,160
would certainly welcome the possibility of participating in the Preternity Project.

578
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,040
We bridge will inevitably laugh ourselves silly when well-wishers in Germany shout out.

579
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,360
Good to fart. It's just an idea from welcome in Abu Dhabi.

580
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:23,120
I put an incorrect link to the Trinity Google group. It's since been corrected so you can

581
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,840
get it now from the DailySourceCode.com show notes.

582
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,400
Hi Adam, this is Mark from the North. Quite so I've fluent suburb. Sorry, don't just woking.

583
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,480
Woking, by the way. I heard that it used to be London's graveyard

584
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,520
until some German bombed woking in World War II or a couple of Germans I guess.

585
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,640
And there's like bones and bits everywhere. But I drive through woking all the time. I'm away

586
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,680
to a ferroaks to the airfield. So nice little places I sit by.

587
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,640
Suggest something for Trinity's World Tour. Well, two things actually.

588
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,440
Firstly, if you don't have any listeners in Iceland to drive for us, you make

589
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,280
away over the Atlantic. I'll gladly step in. I spent six months there last winter.

590
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,240
I would love to go sightseeing again, but this time in the baby poo,

591
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,320
colored station wagon, as I believe she's now described. But more importantly, if you thought

592
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,560
about going on top gear, this round the world challenges exactly the sort of wacky cast stuff

593
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,040
that they love. And frankly, I can't get the image out of my head of the stick driving around

594
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,880
the circuit in Trinity with you cowering in the passenger seat. It takes us course.

595
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,880
Well, that new towering over Richard Hammond, even more than Clarkson usually does.

596
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,480
Oh, one more thing. What ever happened to the Flying Fools project? I was going to volunteer.

597
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,040
I'm learning to fly out of ferrocs at the moment. I'm about 10 hours into my PPL.

598
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,080
So I think I could probably qualify as both flying and, well, a full

599
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,480
I'm sure I can sign off with tailwinds though. Yeah, let me know what you think. Absolutely. Thanks.

600
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,320
Bye for now. Yeah. I just got to have time, man. It's like, you know, this Trinity thing is

601
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,120
taking over the world now. And what an excellent idea. I think you're right. I think that we actually

602
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:03,920
can get pretty far with this. Is that I've got people working on the case? Let's see if we can

603
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,440
rile this puppy up, spin it up big time. Although I can just hear Clarkson now, you know,

604
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,760
it's like, of course, it'll start off by taking the the Mick by taking the Mick out of podcasting.

605
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:24,560
As Adam Curry does some kind of a radiate internet radio show. And a couple of his mates across

606
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:31,760
the world, I've decided to send this biodiesel pipe piece of junk around the globe.

607
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
That was a pretty shitty Clarkson I admit, but working on it. Adam's guy here with the Alaska

608
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,880
pod show. Do you have any idea? Well, yeah, you do. How great the daily source code is.

609
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,600
Do you realize? Yeah, if our world leaders had their own daily source code, how productive

610
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,960
this world might be how we think. You know what it is? It's not that we need our current world

611
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:06,080
leaders to start doing podcasts and start really writing web logs. Someone who does a podcast or

612
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,520
who writes a web log will most likely be the next leader of the free world. That's or maybe, yeah,

613
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,160
it could be in 2008. It's going to be someone like that. So I think it's going to be the other way around.

614
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,760
It might get solved. Well, you know, I'm really excited about this Trinity thing,

615
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,160
because this is just another great example. I'm just thrilled about this project and I'm behind

616
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:34,400
110% or more. I don't know. Is there a percentage? You get my point. I, you know, Alaska is

617
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:41,200
and has become the poster child for global warming here in the states. You know, we want to start

618
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,000
tapping into more oil drilling up here, natural gas. We've got all kinds of things going on. We're

619
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,400
still not moving forward as far as looking to the alternative fuel. So in that, I'm really

620
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:59,920
supportive of Trinity's message. And I think how great would it be to have her start her journey

621
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,200
from Alaska and maybe we could get a Canadian neighbor involved. And, you know, I could drive to the

622
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,360
border of Canada, Canada, take over, head on down into the states and then on across the United

623
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:20,400
States. I mean, from the far west to the far east, you know, there goes Trinity. And so I'm

624
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,240
all for it. You know, we have a healthy network of bio-fuel states. I should say actually backyard

625
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,440
bio-fuel stations, a healthy network of guys and girls that are producing some great fuels.

626
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,480
In fact, I got an interview I'm trying to nail down and I'll share that with you if you're just

627
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,560
it. But, uh, yep, Alaska welcomes Trinity. And, you know, it'd think it'd be fantastic and

628
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,520
just some organizations would definitely get behind you up here and helping you promote this. So

629
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,600
thanks for everything you're doing. Thanks for your daily source code. Take care of yourself again.

630
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,000
All right, bye. Thank you. Thank you, Scott. Yeah, of course Alaska's on the list as this

631
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,920
Canada, but I think we're going to have to do her on the second tour around. What we'll do is kind of

632
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,800
like an orange peel. We got to start with the states first. No doubt about it. So we'll go to the

633
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,640
states. Then we're going to start going around the globe and we'll go up and we'll come, oops, sorry,

634
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:14,320
hit the mic stand. I'm actually using my hands to show you this. And that's when we'll come through

635
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,720
Alaska and we'll go through Canada. Something like that. One more on Trinity. And, you know,

636
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,480
again, this is just about the whole thing you said about the backyard biodiesel. That's exactly

637
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,720
what I'm looking for. I'm looking for mom and pops. I'm looking for people. Just people who are

638
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,080
doing something independent. And in my mind, completely revolutionary. Hey, Adam,

639
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,360
right Adam's here. I love the free Trinity idea. Maybe you can refer to Washington, DC,

640
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,320
and make a stop by the Pentagon, where there's an alternative fuel station that sells both ethanol

641
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:53,920
and B20, 20% biodiesel. I film my jet of TDI there whenever possible. On DSC 537, you

642
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,760
made some excuses for the excess profits of big oil. I agree that they will need tons of investment

643
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,880
dollars if they're going to keep us supplied with as much oil in the future as they are today.

644
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,280
It's getting harder and harder. Translate that to more expensive. To find and produce

645
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,720
a massive quantity of oil that's the economy demands. My preference will be for oil companies to

646
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,760
invest some of their cash into a tonnek power, or the technology offers huge room for improvement.

647
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:27,280
As I told you on DSC 367, I spent a few years driving around a few hundred feet underwater

648
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,720
on a zero-heemission, a tonnek submarine that ran for about a decade and a half without any new fuel.

649
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,560
The boats at my friend Rirem and Willie Colardis is building today will operate for a full

650
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,840
30-year lifetime without any new fuel at all. Just imagine what the world could do if we would

651
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:50,480
do a better job of harnessing the incredible power of the atom for peaceful purposes like electricity

652
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,600
and maybe even airplanes. If you want to hear more about a better way to produce power,

653
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:02,000
check out the Atomic Show at Atomic. That's the podcast network.com. You can also find out

654
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,200
at a really cool engine technology company at AtomsEngines.com. Good luck on the free turnity tour

655
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,640
and think about getting more power from Atoms. Oh dude, I'm telling you, if you could put an Atomic

656
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:21,680
engine in Trinity, absolutely, I'm all for that. I don't know much about it and you know,

657
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,000
I don't want to sidetrack the free turnity project with a whole bunch of talk about Atomic Energy

658
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,880
and the pros and cons and what you do with the waste and all that, but I'm totally into it.

659
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,640
I want to try all that stuff and maybe that is the next step, but still that's not something

660
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,000
you can really do in your backyard or can you? Is all that it really takes is just a flux capacitor

661
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:50,000
and then and you're set? Please don't send anything about Atomic Energy. Let's just, you know,

662
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,120
definitely go listen to that podcast, but let's keep it on track here for a free turnity.

663
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,200
Okay, I got a hurry up the show because I've got a barbro standing by. We're going to talk

664
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,600
about putting the whole project together.

665
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:24,800
Right on, thank you Jeff Smith for the go to thejessmith.com. If you want to have all kinds of

666
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:32,160
cool songs and jingles and stuff for your show. Just a little, uh, I got to finish up because I got

667
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,480
to finish up the tube, the TLA noisy tube topic. Otherwise people keep sending me stuff about that.

668
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,240
Here's one from John Glasscock. That's something to do with different tubes, tubes of a different

669
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,360
sort. Hey, Adam, what should be done to support breast cancer research is to have a calendar of

670
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:51,280
young women's breasts with the proceeds going to the appropriate philanthropy. It would be a good start

671
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:58,160
to have a pod show count. Scott, what is it? John, what is this? It would be a good start to have a

672
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:04,640
pod show calendar with the top podcasters offering breasts shots to propel the calendar idea at

673
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,920
10 bucks a pop. You could raise about $1 million and also diminish the anti-topeless anxiety of

674
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,680
US women to sun themselves. We as men need to get our hands on the issue and make sure that our

675
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:23,040
women are not lumped into the gross statistics. Man, that's a lot of subjective, a lot of

676
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,600
interesting words you use there. Well, dude, you know, I mean, I don't want to start this project,

677
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:33,840
but I would obviously support it and I think that, you know, I'd offer my breasts to the calendar.

678
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,120
I mean, we're going to mail breasts in there too, can't we? I mean, we can't be hypocritical about it

679
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:46,560
and, by the way, you know, men suffer from cancer as well. Maybe not, well, maybe we have a

680
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:52,400
female show breast and male show prostate or something like that. Yeah, you're right, maybe not.

681
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,160
I want to make sure you're again with a note about vowels. You mentioned that you were getting

682
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:05,680
some noise from your valve amp. This is possibly due to the valves themselves. They do wear out

683
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,640
though, if you haven't had it long, then I'd go to that fact, actually, because the greatest

684
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:18,640
cause of noise in amplifiers is actually a warm potential, the volume control, as the wipers

685
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:25,840
scratches across the surface, eventually wears it away and that can introduce noise. So, that's

686
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:33,040
the first thing to check. If it is evolved, then gently tapping it with your fingernail using

687
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,640
the most important one hand behind your back rule, because you need to do this while it's live,

688
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,440
you can tap about the glass part of the valve and you should be able to irritate as enough

689
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:55,680
to produce more of the sound that you think is part of the fault. If you cannot identify it,

690
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:02,160
there's a number printed on the valve. It's fairly easy to type that number into google and find

691
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:09,760
a replacement. Hope that helps. Cheers. You know, it helps if I open up the mic.

692
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:17,840
So, here's the good news. I figured out what's wrong with my TLA 5052 valve processor,

693
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,080
which is what gives me the big gehonus, soon to be seen on a calendar near you.

694
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,080
With the move and repatching and rewiring the studio, one of the plugs became a little

695
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,320
either corroded or corrupted or not quite sure. One of the main ones that goes in from the output of

696
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:38,960
the mixer into the TLA. So, that's what was just on one channel. That's what kind of gave that same

697
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,160
type of impression. There's a noise gates and all kinds of stuff. It would cut in and out.

698
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,920
It was a little tough tracking down, but once I figured out, it turns out, I think the tubes are

699
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:56,960
just fine. But it is eventually going to happen because I'm a big proponent of leaving the tubes on.

700
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,920
I also leave all my computers on, you know, yes, it consumes more energy, but particularly with tubes.

701
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,000
And I don't know, I've just found that my computers last longer and I'm old enough to have had a

702
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,080
couple of computers and other components. And see, I think there was an email, uh, yeah, Franco from

703
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:20,320
Rokostitalia. He says I should turn it off. But I, I think keeping it on is better. I really do.

704
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,480
It's just my, my real world experience. So, anyway, when the tubes do start to go,

705
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,400
certainly know what to do. Hey, they're Adam. This is Andrew from Montario, Canada,

706
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,080
giving you a call about your TLA stereo valve processor. I just thought I'd let you know about your

707
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:39,520
tubes or valves as you call them on that side of the pond. You usually change your tubes every

708
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:45,360
couple of years or whenever they start sounding bad, they don't sound as silky. So, if you think

709
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:51,600
it's time to give them a shot, uh, just it's 12x7 and an ECC 83. It's a very common tube pair.

710
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,320
You replace both of them, plug them in, let them warm up and give it a shot and see if it sounds better.

711
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:01,600
Now, about to, uh, it'll help out. And if you let me for a second, I'd love to promote a podcast I love.

712
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:08,640
It's called a project studio network. They talk tech sound, all the stuff geeks love to talk about,

713
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:14,240
uh, big owl and Mike are fantastic hosts and they line up all sorts of great stuff every week. So,

714
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,920
I recommend everyone go over to the project studio network.com website and download a show and check it out.

715
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,120
That's it. Thanks a lot, and folder. Yeah, thanks man. Okay, so now even know what to get. That's fantastic.

716
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,040
So I'll keep that comment because, uh, invariably it's going to happen. The tubes are going to go.

717
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,120
One of these days. Who knows? Maybe the next, uh, the next dwelling we have, you never know.

718
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,680
By the way, you can kind of tell that I've got a new format going for the show, which will help you in,

719
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,640
because it's going long. I just, there's nothing I can do about it.

720
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,240
Excuse me and say I was splendying. Go daddy. Go go daddy.

721
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:55,440
So I'm trying to do new stuff at the top, uh, you know, personal stuff at the beginning and then

722
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,440
Trinity kind of knew the end. And then topics I want to wrap up after the after Trinity.

723
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,920
Because Trinity is going to go on for a while. That's clear. So I'm wrapping up the, uh,

724
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,920
I'm wrapping up the tubes and, uh, what else is I wrapping up? There's something else.

725
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:14,320
Okay, although we might want to bring the calendar back. I still like that idea. Okay,

726
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,680
I'm going to play one more song for you.

727
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:24,240
As suggested by Sir Jersey Todd, as Bordaud would say, she's nice. I like.

728
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,660
Mhm.

729
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,700
Hello, Bob. Like you're moving on.

730
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,420
Moving on.

731
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,680
Fun, Sandoote-Toga auto home.

732
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,420
Hail, there's nothing you can do.

733
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,860
He watches all while I'm still,

734
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:21,020
How I feel in this way, as a knee,

735
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:26,620
Can I lay and tear my roads alive?

736
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:31,360
Can I roll for me a little more?

737
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,360
Can I roll for love to you?

738
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:41,860
Oh,uke Hello Weir

739
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:45,000
Weir Weir Weir

740
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:50,560
I meant so about lots things now

741
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,260
But I know it's right this is true

742
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,860
Something's got me getting down to you

I need watching you while I stay

745
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,860
And while I'm feeling this way

746
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:21,860
And I'm going to love you

747
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:27,860
