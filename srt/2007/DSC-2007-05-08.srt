1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There, prop.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta, Serator.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Five, nine, or six, warning severe wind share.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
A $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We don't need no sticky and dirty.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
On Jester, it's a battle curry.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
To sit at home all day.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
To sit at home all day.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
All that ain't my life always to waste.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then my life always to waste.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
On and on day, you're a man in blue.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then one day, you're a man in blue.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Then one day, you're a man in blue.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Then one year, you're a man in blue.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Then two day, you're a man in blue.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll get him all in flames, so kick me and say you're under time

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay guys, grab your gal and hit the floor because he was that beat you in the way and just swing too

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Gelons thatened in the future. Now, I've got to save them but me, what the hell is tweaking?

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,040
But he will beat me

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So keepy waitin' on, I'll go move

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,040
tablespoon

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,920
Insameless

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,680
He run

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm happy, but it's alright, I got it, y'all for you

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I got it, I got it, I got it

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Did you want me to talk to you?

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,500
I got it though, I knew it just

56
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,820
Now you just

57
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,880
You ain't gonna think of me

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,920
But I'd do it

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,320
Wait, wait, wait…

60
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,620
And I can't do it

61
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,520
Sorry, I don't wanna break my�

62
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,980

Ah!

66

Ahhh!

67
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,700

Ticka tKoo-Koo

69
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,180
Ticka is a green

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,660
olved

71
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,220
Shea

72
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,820
A-A exclusively

75
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,540
Patricia was in the Netherlands to perform this song on the Dutch version of Dancing with the Stars,

76
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:41,300
and it's quite a production, and she sure makes it look easy. So basically I was a

77
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:50,580
groupy fan, water boy, sex toy, and pilot. I left the driving up to Taxi Eric. He was the chauffeur.

78
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,500
I almost don't know where to start. Let me just go back to Friday of course. It was the second

79
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:04,980
series of the maximum music football Fridays. They had a show of 5.95 Friday. Great fun. Thank you very

80
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:13,780
much. That was a great Friday show. I'm just a fan. I love you show. Keep it up. I'm a folder. I'm a

81
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:21,940
country. I'm a country. All of that. So I heard that and I'm like, oh yes, yet another reason. People talk

82
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:29,140
about it baby. It's the extended version of the folder. Sam doing it wrong.

83
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:40,020
We're done to our baby. Don't worry. Because I'm a wife and wife and wife and wife and my mom.

84
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:51,940
Who's I'm a folder? I'm a scruncher. I'm a roller and I'm a buncher. I do my business on the throne.

85
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:03,620
I'm a sitter. I'm a standard. I'm a left-of-right tender. It's nice to know I'm not alone.

86
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,420
Oh, sorry. Love you, man.

87
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,780
All right. Okay. I've had a little time to collect my thoughts now. Finally.

88
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,940
So the song. That is the remix of Patricia's number one hit from 1980s.

89
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,660
Six. I think. 84 or something like that. I don't know. I mean, the 80s somewhere.

90
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:51,140
And that will be, hopefully by the time you're hearing this show, if not within hours, thereof.

91
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,340
That will be on the pod save music now. We're finally all rights, including the rights to the

92
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,980
ASCAP BMI rights for the for the actual songwriting themselves. Everything's been arranged. This

93
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,660
is going completely pod safe. So I'm very happy. That was tough, by the way. The hardest part,

94
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,540
believe it or not, was the cadence at the beginning, the the Marines. You know, who are marching?

95
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:20,180
You know, what is it? You used to sit at home all day? Well, that came from a CD that had to be

96
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,020
ahead to find out who made it to get appropriate rights. And God, man, the old system really

97
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:34,580
does blow chunks. Anyway, so that would be pod safe. And I guess it's going to go on iTunes. I

98
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,340
don't know if it's going on only the Dutch iTunes. And it's going like a million different

99
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:44,020
music stores. I've learned so much again about the business these days. And wow, it's really

100
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:52,100
pathetic in Holland. You can have a top 10 hit in the official top 40 music charts for the equivalent

101
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:58,820
of probably less than what we did with bum rush the charts. But I digress. So I'm pretty sure

102
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:05,940
it was going to perform this this live and the telecast is live on Sunday night in the results

103
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,900
portion of the show. If you follow dancing with the stars that you know what I'm talking about,

104
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,260
it's a typical like idle thing, vote off. But I have to say the right show because of the dancing

105
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,300
and the right and the music as well, you know, the right audience. You know, this is, yeah,

106
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,860
I think it was exactly the right time to do it. Also, every year around the fifth of May,

107
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,380
which is liberation day in the Netherlands, they always say, hey, it would be great if we get the

108
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,420
star sisters in their whole kind of like, you know, war is over vibe and perform at this party,

109
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:39,060
which, or wherever. And she's never really wanted to do that. But so, you know, now, yeah,

110
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,660
kind of made sense. And I had said, you know, what, why don't, why don't I call the marines up that I

111
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,900
was in Iraq with? And we'll have them all in their whites. And, you know, they'll, you know,

112
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,780
we'll kind of make it big. Make it a big Hollywood type show production. And she had already had

113
00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:00,580
dancers planned and everything. So, okay. So, and by the way, the ministry of defense at first said

114
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,500
no, we really like the idea. But you're very Dutch by the way, to say, no, we just want to keep

115
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,980
low profile. And then Patricia's record company boss, villain from Coto, better known as Willy the K.

116
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:18,340
He's also the one that has the rights to Venus, shocking blue that I played on Friday and golden

117
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:24,420
earring radar love to my favorite tracks. And he's owned those for, you know, 35 years, whatever.

118
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,700
And by the way, the golden earring is still doing very well, shocking blue not so the lead singer

119
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:37,380
passed away a couple months ago. I digress again with the hell am I doing? I got a fast forward to

120
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,660
today, pretty, pretty great. Anyway, so, um, Patricia was over there, uh, had already been rehearsing

121
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:49,220
for a couple days. And I went over, uh, Sunday. And Captain Dan couldn't make it. Now, you know,

122
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,420
I've done a channel crossing solo before from Antwerp to, uh, back to Pharaoh. So, you know,

123
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,140
hadn't gone the other way yet. And the weather, I have to say, was far from optimum. In fact,

124
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:05,540
I crossed the channel at 500 feet above, uh, above the water. It would be, and that was in order to

125
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,940
stay in visual conditions underneath the cloud base. And, you know, at times it was a thousand feet.

126
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,380
But it was like 500 feet. And I was, you know, literally, oh, there's a ship. I'll just go around

127
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,780
to make sure he has no antennas. It was a very, very, you know, um, spitfire World War II type experience.

128
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,620
Me got into the Netherlands, uh, I was able to do about a thousand, uh, actually I went to Antwerp

129
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,860
first. Oh, check this out. So, I went to visit the wing commander who's based at, uh, at Antwerp airport.

130
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,060
And, uh, and his, his, his whole operation there has been here for, been there for many years. So,

131
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,740
he knows everybody knows everything. And of course, new when I was on my final approach. And

132
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,300
so, I'm coming in on the, uh, runaway two nine, which is my favorite, direct wind direction for,

133
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,780
for Antwerp because, um, you actually fly right over the road. And they have a, um, a signal

134
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,620
light there. And they put it on red and traffic stops as you make the approach, which is,

135
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,220
it's fun. But, you know, it's also like, oh, shit, man. Do these people are waiting for me. So,

136
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,500
all these things are flashing through your head is run final. And by the way, it's a beautiful,

137
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,500
it's a huge runway. It's broad. It's long. But, um, about halfway down the runway is where Williams

138
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,220
hangar is on the right hand side. And it was a beautiful sunny day at this point in Antwerp. And,

139
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,340
you know, they're all, you know, a couple other people I know, they're all out there. They all

140
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,540
know I'm coming into. They're all like standing there, like, like judges. You know, it's like,

141
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,900
and you see that, like, oh, crap, man. It's like, uh, I got to make a good landing. And of course,

142
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,780
you know, a little minor bounce there. And, you know, everything's fine. So, they get to

143
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,100
fuck around with you for 20 minutes, at least. Then from there, I went to Hilversum because, uh,

144
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,980
I had some coffee hung out then, uh, uh, off to Hilversum. At this point, I'm feeling pretty good,

145
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,740
because I did the channel crossing, you know, and, uh, yeah, and I'm like, all right, this, uh,

146
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,140
I'm getting, and then I'm getting my things together. For those of you who have ever done solo flights

147
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,180
with the, you know, privately, you understand that feeling. It's almost like you get your driver's license,

148
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,900
and you've accomplished making it to your friend's house without getting yourself killed or killing

149
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,260
someone else. Uh, in this case, because the whole channel crossing and bad weather, etc.

150
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:10,820
So then, uh, you know, so I go to the studio and hang out and say, of course, it's television. So

151
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,100
it's hours and hours and hours of rehearsal and man, she's really working it and, and the captain

152
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:24,420
and, uh, to other, one other guy, um, from the, uh, from the ministry, uh, actually they are,

153
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,540
uh, what are they, um, their Marines, but they do the, uh, PR, I guess. Yeah, public relations. So they

154
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,980
get to wear a snazzy blue suit. Uh, I knew those guys from, uh, from the rack journey. So, you know,

155
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,260
it was good to see and we're hanging out. I'm looking at these other kids, man, and they were just

156
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:44,100
kids. These Marines were 18, 19 years old. You know, in fact, I know for a fact judging by the rhythm

157
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,380
that many of them have probably not even had sex before, at least not with someone else,

158
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:55,140
no rhythm at all. Um, and, you know, so they, they had to, you know, rehearse as well and you got 23

159
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,500
of these guys and you got to get them all to step to the rhythm and they just had no rhythm.

160
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:11,860
But anyway, uh, live show, bloody hot inside the air conditioner was broken, um, and it was, uh,

161
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,020
you know, with the, everything just went perfect. Yeah, you've probably seen the, the video,

162
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:22,340
the Superfan Rick sent me, put it up on YouTube. So I put that into, uh, uh, at curry.com. I'm

163
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,460
getting a DVD so I can put up a high res version, but I thought it was fantastic. It was, you know,

164
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,620
a lot goes into doing something like that. Just for three short minutes, a lot of work went into it.

165
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,420
And I think everyone did a stellar job in the TV crew did it as well. I mean, it's so hard to,

166
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,100
to really do something like that, particularly in the live situation. All right. So great show,

167
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,580
you know, party. And by the way, next time the lady P is on the show, man, she was like, uh,

168
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:57,460
hugging and kissing. And, I don't know, but with some sexy women too, I was, I am, oh, man.

169
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:03,620
You know, she's, my wife was so totally in her element, so completely in her vibe and just loving

170
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:09,460
every minute of it. And, uh, yeah, and there was a good vibe with the, uh, with the marines,

171
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:16,900
without a doubt. I just look at these guys like, man, they're representing the country. And there's

172
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:23,220
someone's kid literally 18, 19 years old. Anyway, so, uh, we go back to Amsterdam. Patricia's found

173
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,220
this fantastic new hotel. And in fact, I said to the, uh, to the night manager, I think I said,

174
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,460
look, you know, I love this hotel so much. I'm sorry. I can't promote it because I don't want

175
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,580
anyone else. There's not a lot of rooms. It's a very small hotel. And we literally have this room that,

176
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,620
you know, with big French windows that open up to the back of the vandal park. And there's just

177
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,260
a pond there and ducks and trees. And it's so serene. And you wouldn't even know, you would think

178
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,340
you were in the middle of the countryside, not in the middle of the city. And it was really nice,

179
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,940
believe me at that point. It was really nice. So the next morning, uh, we sleep in a little bit.

180
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,220
And this is Monday. And so, you know, I want to get home on time to do my regular San Francisco

181
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:09,460
morning, wake up, pod show calls, conference calls, which starts around three or four, uh, UK times

182
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,860
so four or five. So we had to be out of there. Went to the airport at one. And it was the weather was

183
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:20,260
crap. Oh, man. It was really, really shit. And I was looking to radar and the minimums were like

184
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,460
500 feet. But at the times it was dipping down to 400 feet. And I'm like, that's it. You know,

185
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,300
I just can't. In fact, I spoke to an instructor who said, hey, you know, I really love what

186
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,420
Patricia did last night on TV. And we'd like to see more of that. So don't go. I was like, okay,

187
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:39,220
there's the angel from above saying something. I think we should just shut her down. And so we didn't,

188
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,820
you know, we went back. And of course, we could get back into our same room. And we had another

189
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:51,060
lovely evening, a nice rice towel that we had Indonesian rice dinner, which was set up overlooking

190
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,060
the little pond at night. Oh, my God, I can't tell you how, and this is, do you understand why I'm

191
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:01,380
saying I'm so happy that I'm alive? Um, and, you know, at this point Patricia said, you know,

192
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,500
because of course it was quite a surprise to her that I showed up at the studio without Captain

193
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,420
Dan. And she said, what's this? Where's Dan? I said, well, I came by myself and she's like, oh,

194
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,580
the crap. And taxi area, everyone knew almost. But I instructed everyone not to tell Patricia,

195
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,660
because I knew she just worried. We're doing all the rehearsals before I got there. So

196
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,460
but she agreed to go, I'll go back with you. No problem. And then of course, even in that

197
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,060
crap weather, she was willing to fly back. And so at night, you know, we had this nice romantic

198
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:35,220
evening, got the candles going. It's just on. I just have one of those feelings. You know,

199
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,860
remember the feeling you had with the school kids and a nice cube. And you didn't want to get

200
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,780
on the flight. I said, yeah, I said, you know, everything was so beautiful. I mean, you can just see

201
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:49,220
the headline where it's like, you know, after all this fantastic week of, you know, great

202
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,900
talk show appearances and just fun and newspaper articles and being completely in the limelight.

203
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:02,340
It would suck so bad if we both like died in a fiery crash. And this is why I said, all right,

204
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:08,260
so I booked a commercial flight back. And the next morning, you know, so that was this morning.

205
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,940
I got up. And the wing commander called, he said, look, man, you should go. I should go now.

206
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,820
And I'd already looked at the at the forecast. And I knew that it was going to be kind of, uh,

207
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:25,300
kind of windy in the UK. So, you know, pop in, drive off, fly off. And go to the airfield, fly

208
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:31,780
fantastic flight over the Netherlands, flamb fantastic over the, uh, uh, over the channel. And then I

209
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:40,500
coast in at Manston and man, the shit hit the fan. It was 17 knots, which is almost nothing,

210
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:47,540
gusting to 38 gusting. So you're, you're the wind is literally doubling and hitting you all of a

211
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,820
sudden, just out of nowhere. And man, I was happy Patricia. I'm happy no one else was on the plane at

212
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:59,300
all, except an experience pilot because it was, I was really banging up and down left and right.

213
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,100
And it was, it was horrific. In fact, by the time I got to big and hill, which is on route to Farrow,

214
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:09,140
because it's almost, you know, so I mainly have 15 miles to go. And I usually want to cross overhead

215
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,260
their runway, because it's my direct track to home. And you have to ask permission to do that.

216
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:21,380
I could see jets, big ass jets landing in front of me, uh, you know, like a five mile, uh, five mile

217
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:27,140
distance. And I could hear the, uh, the tower, uh, doing the wind call, they're like 17 knots, 18,

218
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,780
yeah. And of course, the wind direction, 270, which is across wind. So all, you know, your plane is already

219
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,580
coming in crooked. And, uh, then it's like 35 knots. And, you know, you could see these planes doing

220
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,900
go rounds, because they literally could not land because of what's known as wind shear. I don't

221
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:46,660
like, oh, shit, man. And I'm only 15 miles down the road. I've got exactly the same situation.

222
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:52,100
So I had to go to the south of, uh, uh, of big and hill, because they couldn't handle my traffic

223
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,100
in the midst of all these planes missing their approaches. And at this point, I'm like, all right,

224
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,020
shit, good, because I was at 2,000 feet, you have to be that minimum to do the crossing. So I'm

225
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,620
like down to 1,000 or 1,400 or rather. And I'm off to Farrow radar, and then I'm at

226
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,780
Aquaman. I'm ready to go in. And luckily, no one's in the circuit. Of course, no one's flying

227
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:17,220
today. And then I've got 17 knots, uh, not the same thing. And 17 knots, uh, at 270, I'm on a 24 runway.

228
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,620
So there's a 30 degree difference right there. So the wind is coming from the side at 17 knots. So

229
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:31,300
20 miles an hour. And a gusting 35. And dude, you know, uh, I just pulled it right in. I got to tell you

230
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:38,420
at a certain point that there was so much headwind and crosswind that I was almost standing still.

231
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:43,620
And luckily, well timed, I was almost on the runway and I just pulled her clothes and, you know,

232
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,100
just sat her down and, you know, boom, but the boom, I'm here. And almost immediately,

233
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,860
I didn't break it all. The thing was just standing still. So, and that, my friends, is what

234
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:59,700
makes you feel very, very much alive. Hey, on the phone with me again. Look, look, it's

235
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,980
Alec Baldwin. Dude, what's going on? I heard you were talking to people about you about me.

236
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,940
Do call yourself a salesman. You son of a bitch. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on now?

237
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:14,260
You laughing now? Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. I'll stop laughing. I mean, what's going on? I thought I was doing

238
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:19,540
pretty good song. Some of those go daddyads, you know? I can go out there tonight. The materials you

239
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:27,540
got make myself $15,000. Tonight, in two hours, can you? $15,000, and two hours, and two hours,

240
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:33,300
and go daddy stuff, man. I don't know. I mean, it's the best web domain name register people out there,

241
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,780
but I don't know if people are going to want to do that. Are you, you're serious, $15,000?

242
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:43,220
A guy don't walk on the lot. Let's be once to buy. Sitting out there waiting to give you the

243
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,500
money. Are you going to take it? Are you mad enough to take it?

244
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,900
All right, all right, you got my attention. Have I got your attention now?

245
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,620
Yeah, you got my attention. Have I got your attention now?

246
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,220
All right, well, what do you want me to do? I mean, I'm working really hard at selling some of these

247
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,900
domain name things. I mean, go daddy's got all these different kinds of services. It's really,

248
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,100
really, if you're starting a website, you got to go check it out. What do you want me to do?

249
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:12,340
Because only one thing counts in this life get them to sign on the line, which is dotted.

250
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,020
You hear me? You fucking faggotts? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's up with the language? What's up

251
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,860
like? Hey, I understand the ponchos actually running a contest for me this month. What's going on?

252
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,180
Because we're adding a little something to this month's sales contest. As you all know, first

253
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:32,820
prize is a Cadillac Eldorado. Anybody want to see second prize? Second prize is a set of steak knives.

254
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:43,460
Third prize is your fight. Fire. Eldorado, come on, what are you talking about? Who sent you here?

255
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,980
I'm here from downtown. Downtown, what the fuck are you talking about? Who put you up to this?

256
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,980
I'm here from Mitch and Murray. Mitch and Murray, it's Adam and Ron.

257
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:59,060
Ball and man, what are you talking about? Let me get a cup of coffee here. Put that coffee down.

258
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,260
Are you kidding me? You're kidding me? Why can't I even drink coffee? Coffee's for clothes as own.

259
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,740
Oh man, all right, all right, any advice? I'm going to tell people to use Jersey one at the time of

260
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,700
checkout and they can save 10% on their order. I think that's a pretty good deal, right?

261
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,060
I wish you good luck, but you wouldn't know what to do with it if you got it.

262
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,540
Oh man, you are rough. All right, listen, I'm really psyched about GoDaddy being a

263
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,180
sponsor of the Jersey time show and I want everybody to run out there and get the register

264
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,900
some domain names, all right? Is that good enough for you, Baldwin? Good. Okay, good enough.

265
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,660
Todd, Jersey Todd, you remind me so much of me as a young boy when I was

266
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,660
studying to take the bar exam.

267
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:48,820
I like it. Dude, I like it. That's advertising and it's content. Of course, this is disposable

268
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,620
only works one time. Nice, thanks. Hey, use the checkout code for Jersey Todd. I've know I

269
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,420
what is it? Jts one two or three and of course, you can always use DSC three.

270
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,180
So my day was almost over. If it's not worth for the fact that we saw here I am, I've landed

271
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:12,260
and the tower is literally going like, dude, good job. Because everyone was either coming in

272
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:17,940
really messed up or not flying at all. And I'm like, yeah, okay, he says, yeah, hang

273
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,180
everyone and you've got some people waiting for you. Five people, five yellow coats, yellow jack

274
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:28,900
and it's basically three police with a dog and two immigration officers. Apparently,

275
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:35,140
my general declaration, we call the Gen Deck. I'd sent an updated one that I was coming today.

276
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,860
Then they had asked me specifically to send it through email instead of facts. I think I even

277
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,220
discussed it here on the show. And low and behold, that system failed as well because essentially

278
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,820
they take it and they send it to the police and they send it to immigrations and they make

279
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,580
sure everything's copesthetic and, you know, and with the facts that always work, I do the email,

280
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,980
of course, it messes up. And I should maybe should have double check with them. But anyway,

281
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:04,260
they had my flight plan so they knew to look for it. And the minute you shut down the engine,

282
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,700
they're already on top of you, right? And first, my brain's going, okay, I'll clear.

283
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:18,100
And then I open up the door and I have my life vest on my yellow life jacket with, you know,

284
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,820
not inflated, just you're ready for me to pull the rip cord if I need it in the drink.

285
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,580
Because I know that if I'm flying at 500 feet, I'm not going to have time to put this thing on.

286
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,580
So I fly with it on. Yeah, don't look all that manually. But, and she says to me,

287
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,340
what's that for? Is that your oxygen? I didn't know that it was swimming.

288
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,140
What do you mean for swimming? In one case, I go in the drink. I flew across the channel. Oh, oh.

289
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,260
Okay. I said, just give me a moment. If you don't mind, I just, you know, that was pretty rough.

290
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,620
I just want to breathe for a second. And anyway, so that was a whole mess. They were very,

291
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,660
very friendly, I have to say. And then I had to get the cases out. Because, of course, I took Patricia's 100 pounds suit case with me.

292
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,100
So she didn't have to lug that through the airport. She could just go with carrying on.

293
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:06,180
And, you know, the dog, very nice puppy dog. You know, he jumped in. He actually wasn't looking for drugs.

294
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,780
I'm sure if he was, he could have at least smelled some residue, something somewhere. So, you know,

295
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:16,420
or he was not a very good dog. And I'd said, you know, what are you guys doing? You know,

296
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,860
because I didn't have my general declaration. No, no, no, we're doing a spot check today.

297
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,500
All small airports throughout the country are being checked for terrorism.

298
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,820
For, you know, basically, I, so I would presume the dog was a bomb sniffing dog, sniffing,

299
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:36,820
for explosives. And they, they more or less confirmed that. So that's your homeland security

300
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,740
pounds at work, my friends. Waiting around all day for me to come back home.

301
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,940
Although I must say, it's, if I were to smuggle anything into the country,

302
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,940
under any circumstances, that would be the way to do it, because, you know, clearly nine times out of

303
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,500
20, maybe even nine times out of 30, no, no.

304
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,580
You know, I've only gotten a checks once or twice, so I'd have to say one and a hundred.

305
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,540
That's just no way to protect that shit. There's so many movements going on. There's just no way to do it.

306
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:17,540
Anyway, so I beat Patricia home. I was here. I don't know, actually, you know, who, who

307
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,180
called in, I think was Friday or Thursday, who's at the, who has the office at the airport.

308
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,500
He was sitting through his window, taking pictures of me getting busted with the dog and the

309
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:33,140
plane. I'll post him on flicker and I'll put something on in the show notes. It's hilarious. He was sitting there

310
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,860
snapping away. And indeed, remember he invited me to come in and look at his toys and that I,

311
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,900
you know, typically don't answer invitations from men like that to go and look at their toys.

312
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:49,700
Dude, this dude has some serious fucking toys. I mean, he does, I don't see if I can say this

313
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:57,620
right, his company surveys, power lines. And they can do aerial photography all with all this,

314
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:04,740
you know, a solid-state gyroscopic shit and super duper GPS and, you know, I'm recording

315
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,860
100,000 data points per second. They can go back and take this information post process and render.

316
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,220
I mean, you think Google Earth is cool. You should see this shit. I mean, he's got everything completely

317
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,020
rendered in different color tones. You can literally see the sag of the wires because that's what

318
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:28,420
he's his company measures is the sag between two huge power line towers because that's where you

319
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,500
can get a lot of efficiency. The less sag, the more efficiency because you also need less towers,

320
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,900
et cetera. And there's a whole bunch of reasons why to do that. And he was great, man. Of course,

321
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,460
he'll listen to the show a lot. And it's always reporting in on stuff going on at the airport.

322
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,900
In fact, he is a savant of the Charlie. I have to admit, he is definitely not officially identified

323
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:53,220
as such, but, you know, as per now, a savant in some wacky ass crazy shit. And he had a sense

324
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,460
say, oh, machine, and so we're drinkin' and say, oh, coffee, I'm having a little smoke just chilling out

325
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,660
from the, the whole experience and he showed me all this cool stuff. And, uh, and it was just,

326
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:08,580
again, it's just a great day to be alive. I gotta tell you. Uh, let me see, what should I do?

327
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:15,140
I got something, well, uh, Luke, the candy man from Nokia called it. I'm going to say that for tomorrow.

328
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,660
Okay. I want to prepare a little bit better for that. Uh, there's one more song I want to play.

329
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:24,420
And it comes with its own introduction attached. Hello, Mr. Curry. This is Nigel from Coidon.

330
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:30,660
Recently I said him for my good friend, Brenna over a pod share radio. You see, he's getting his

331
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:36,900
charbals worked down, poor fella. I feel even worse because I let his dog out and drink

332
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,740
all his beer, but listen, the featured orders was a band called React. You ever heard of him?

333
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,580
Ooh, I get a right stiffy, I tell you right now, I'm thinking about that lead vocalist,

334
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:55,860
her name's Sandy. Ooh, I could do the, in any rate, after going with what Mr. Brenna said,

335
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:02,900
that ripped is probably one of the top 10 alternative rock bands over the pod safe music network.

336
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,380
Don't believe me, mate. Yeah, judge for yourself.

337
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

338
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:29,780
There's nothing, one and all it makes what dreams come true.

339
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,060
There's nothing, one and all it makes what dreams come true.

340
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,220
There's nothing, one and all that I feel that I feel this way. You can grab a hole with him.

341
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:42,580
And I play, I can see his stars, if you play it bright. I need to grab a touchy hand.

342
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:55,700
Hey, there's a ring. You've got the one and all that I see. You can play, you won't be me.

343
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:02,740
I can't keep playing, and there's a ring.

344
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,500
It's like all the countdown moves in control.

345
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,780
The needs passed and we get touched by swamps.

346
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:23,540
I feel so good, but I'm in your arms. I get paralyzed, but I'm in your arms.

347
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:29,300
I need to see his stars, if you play it bright. I need to grab a touchy hand.

348
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:42,580
Hey, there's a ring. You've got the one and all that I see. You can play, you won't be me.

349
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:50,660
I can't keep hanging in this of me. You've got the one and all that I see. You've got the one and all that I see.

350
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,420
It's like all the countdown moves in control.

351
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,820
The needs passed and we get touched by swamps.

352
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,940
I need to see his stars, if you play it bright.

353
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,820
No, no, no. No. No. Please come to my heart.

354
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:32,260
Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Now come down.

355
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:43,060
Hey, there's a ring. You've got the one and all that I see. You can play, you won't be me.

356
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,940
I can't keep hanging in this of me. You've got the one and all that I see. You can play, you won't be me.

357
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,420
And take something, and hand it to you,

358
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,420
And take something, and hand it to you,

359
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,660
And hold your body, and hold your body,

360
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,420
And hold your breath, and your body,

361
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,060
And hold your breath, and hold your breath,

362
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,420
And hold your breath, and hold your breath,

363
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,420
And hold your breath, and hold your breath,

364
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,060
And hold your breath, and hold your breath,

365
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,060
And hold your breath, and hold your breath,

366
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,100
And hold your breath, and hold your breath,

367
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,000
and hold your breath, and hold your breath,

368
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,040
Anduffle.

369
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,800
You know, honestly I was just sitting there kicking back,

370
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,960
listening to that song, kinda reflecting again,

371
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,320
on the events of the past three days.

372
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,780
And I, of course I heard Nigel's introduction to the song,

373
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,720
but, and then like who is that band, again,

374
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,000
cause I'm digging this song, right?

375
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,600
And then I saw it go back to what was that?

376
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Well, someone yelling?

377
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,240
Oh, donk.

378
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,960
The dog is barking.

379
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,540
So I'll go back to the email that suggested,

380
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,580
You know, I play this and it's from Nigel says hello mate. This one's for your show now

381
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,700
This caught my eye in my email because the subject of the email was I get a big

382
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,300
Stiffy when I listen to this band. I'm like all right. Let me check it out

383
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,540
But he doesn't say who it is and so not have to go back and listen to it again. And listen to the Australian accent. Oh, shit

384
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,020
You may have heard a special promotion at the beginning of the show

385
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,040
which we de-gapped in to US shows only for our

386
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,280
Sockless zone and now it wasn't up one before I started to record the show

387
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,080
So if it if it was

388
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
Shit, I'll talk about it tomorrow

389
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,280
I think probably the most widely worked on project within pod show right now

390
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:46,640
Yet the least known about because it's I don't know it's it's been kind of under a veil of secrecy without it

391
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:53,680
Really being secret and it's worked out quite well. This is it's pretty huge that we're gonna do starting with the United States with the listeners

392
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,680
You get the opportunity to help us suck less and it's done through a number of different means

393
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,280
By the way, it can be done completely anonymously. It's

394
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,640
You know a number of surveys. It's are you gonna be listening to advertising all kinds of fun stuff

395
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:16,120
But sucklands pot show each you the help us suck less help us

396
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,480
Help us sucklands pot show each you the help us suck less

397
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
You the help us suck less

398
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
So now otherwise you can always

399
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:33,200
You know download some other pod show to check if you already had this one to check and see if if it started up yet

400
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,240
I just don't want to blow it and have you all go trying to find something that's not there

401
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,720
Okay, Danny source code.com is where you can find show notes to

402
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,200
Well, I was a lot of jabber for me in this episode. I hope I didn't boy too much with my exciting life

403
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
I just love sharing it because

404
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,000
Crap man if it's worth living is worth documenting

405

Talk to you tomorrow, buddy another pod show podcast stick it in your ear

407
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
