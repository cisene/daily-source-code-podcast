1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Make a statement with Sony stereo ear buds, sleek metal housings that reduce vibration

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,400
delivering killer sound from a tiny package.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Buy yours at Sony.com-slashheadphones, Sony ear buds were style-meat sound.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:28,800
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,400
radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,400
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Sometimes an atom's all alone.

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,400
He meets his love right there on the microphone.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,400
So here she is, yes, the Lady Patricia.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,400
The say-to-heads are better than one.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:02,400
And with this angel from above, there's nothing that they both can't do.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,400
They got to have a wonderful journey.

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Time's filled with all the clinging glitter.

14
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Butterflies of happiness.

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:35,400
His voice sounds even better.

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,400
When the Lady arrives on the Delta Cherichardly, oh I see.

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,400
A good split, the feeling of her love penetrates his head.

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,400
The meaning of life, it feels so matching when she's around.

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,400
My God, she looked great to get the shell on the road.

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,400
An open vest, the Passegdabla.

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,400
She smiles and pray for you in bed.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:09,400
My dear Charlie Friends, dear Pat Father, Elife Patricia.

23
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,400
One giant stack for AC is a giant stack for the Queen.

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Ladies and gentlemen, just and only here on the DSC.

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Join Adam and the lovely Lady Patricia.

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Summer journeys to Niagara, and to World of Places,

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
I believe all our kids.

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,400
We'll save our fears.

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,400
I've a cozy little flat in what is known as old man hadn't we'll settle down.

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Right here in town, we'll have man hadn't.

31
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,400
The Bronx and Staten Island too.

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:07,400
It's lovely going through the zoo.

33
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,400
It's very fancy.

34
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
I know the lancest street you know.

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,400
The some way charms are so.

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,400
When Bobby breezes blow to and fro.

37
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,400
And tell me what street compares with much street into life.

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Sweet push cards gently glide.

39
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:44,400
The great big cities of wonder store.

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Just make for a girl and boy.

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:57,400
We'll turn that hat into an island of joy.

42
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:04,400
We'll go to yankers where true love conquers in the wild.

43
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:14,400
And start together dear in child.

44
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,400
We'll go to Coney and eat baloney on a road.

45
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,400
In central park we'll stroll where our first kiss we stole.

46
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,400
So do so.

47
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,400
And my fair lady is a terrific show they say.

48
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,400
We both may see it close.

49
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Someday the city's glamour can never spoil.

50
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,400
The dreams of a boy and go.

51
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:04,400
We'll turn man hat into an island of joy.

52
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Hey everybody it's dream of a boy and go.

53
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
A boy and go.

54
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
A boy and go.

55
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Daily source code episode number 701 coming to you from the curry manner.

56
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,400
And we welcome the lady Patricia.

57
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Hey baby how you doing?

58
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Yeah doing fine.

59
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,400
It's so nice to hear that song.

60
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
You can see New York.

61
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
If you hear this song you see New York.

62
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
That's why I chose it specifically for you baby.

63
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,400
I can see myself walking in the central park.

64
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Yes.

65
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
It's so beautiful.

66
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire.

67
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Especially when it's winter.

68
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
I remember that I remember the smell.

69
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Jack Frost nipping at my nuts.

70
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Yep.

71
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,400
And you could feed the little squirrels there.

72
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
But it was very cold in the winter.

73
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,400
So that's why I played it for you because I knew we would give you that New York vibe.

74
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
And you were talking about New York the other day.

75
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
I know.

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
I've got New York on my mind.

77
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Really?

78
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Really?

79
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
I don't know why.

80
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
It's totally.

81
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,400
I can feel the atmosphere and everything.

82
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
The whole thing.

83
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Really?

84
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
How long has it been since you've been there?

85
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Not so long.

86
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I think it was to use it.

87
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
In a year ago.

88
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Wasn't it a year?

89
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Longer than that.

90
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Longer than that.

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Longer than that.

92
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Longer than that.

93
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
I remember what it was.

94
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
John for Cartveg was there too.

95
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Oh, really?

96
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Yeah.

97
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Walking.

98
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Maybe that was more than a year now.

99
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
At the end of the year.

100
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
At the end of the year.

101
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
I think it was.

102
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
I think it's two years ago.

103
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Time is going by so fast.

104
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
I know.

105
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
I know.

106
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Ladies and gentlemen, the lady Patricia is wearing a nice.

107
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
What is that you have on?

108
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
It is.

109
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
She's dressed in black.

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Rubimanto.

111
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Rubimanto.

112
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Yes.

113
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Yes.

114
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Rubimanto.

115
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Nice boots by the way.

116
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Oh, yes, and.

117
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Oh, wow.

118
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
I'm not taking them off anymore.

119
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
No, I've noticed that.

120
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
And did you notice it last night in bed?

121
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
I was wearing them too.

122
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
No.

123
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
You didn't.

124
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
No.

125
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
No.

126
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
No.

127
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
It wasn't necessary.

128
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,400
I didn't need the boots to get all excited.

129
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
I know.

130
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Say, please just tell them.

131
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Just tell them.

132
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
It's good for my ego.

133
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Holy.

134
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
So you don't need that hunt.

135
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Yeah, I do.

136
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Everybody knows you got a big ego.

137
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Yeah, big ego.

138
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Yeah.

139
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,400
So been home for the holidays, which was nice.

140
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Nice to be.

141
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Nice to be home.

142
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Wow.

143
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Pretty much not stop talking.

144
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Since I came home.

145
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,400
But you were always so many times.

146
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Yeah.

147
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
It was the first it was like you were home and gone again.

148
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Yeah.

149
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
It was the home and gone again.

150
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
10 or 11 days in San Francisco that I come back.

151
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Then I went to Helsinki.

152
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
You went to New York.

153
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
No, no.

154
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
First the first I went to San Francisco came back.

155
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Went to Helsinki.

156
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
He was thinking.

157
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
He was thinking.

158
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
It's not true.

159
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
It doesn't stink.

160
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I never did food.

161
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
No, I had some good food.

162
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
I had reindeer.

163
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
You had good food.

164
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Yeah, I like it.

165
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
We remember all the stinky fish every time.

166
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Well, I hung out with the candy man.

167
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
You know, he knows where to take a stinky fish.

168
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
A stinky fish.

169
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
They had stinky fish there, too.

170
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
I know.

171
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
They do have some kind of stinky stuff.

172
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
So Helsinki then came back here.

173
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Then went to San Francisco again.

174
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
And I'm supposed to stay for a week and stay for two weeks.

175
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Yeah.

176
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Then came back.

177
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Then went to New York.

178
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
New York.

179
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
For four days or whatever.

180
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Normally I would have gone with you.

181
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
To New York.

182
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Yeah.

183
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,400
That was not possible because you didn't have any time to do something fun.

184
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
I know.

185
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
And it wasn't fun because it was wet.

186
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
It was wet and it snowed.

187
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Everybody had a cold hair.

188
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Why don't I had a cold in New York, too?

189
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
No.

190
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Which we've kind of scared.

191
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
I mean, I haven't.

192
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,400
I had my, my sick time this year.

193
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Mm-hmm.

194
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
That's it.

195
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
How about you?

196
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Yeah.

197
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Yeah.

198
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Yeah.

199
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Christina hasn't been really sick.

200
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Well, she brings the sniffles.

201
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Right.

202
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,400
But what she does is she fights it real quickly.

203
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
It's gone.

204
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
And then we have it.

205
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,400
And I can get rid of it because I'm an old fart, of course.

206
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Of course.

207
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Yep.

208
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,400
So this will more than likely be the last show that you're on.

209
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Uh, of 2007.

210
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
That's right.

211
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Can you?

212
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
I was thinking about it.

213
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
I couldn't believe it.

214
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
You know?

215
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
But I was young.

216
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Imagine.

217
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I mean, I come from the 60s.

218
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Yes.

219
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
And then you come from before the 60s.

220
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
I know.

221
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
But in the 60s, start to think.

222
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Wow.

223
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
It's 60s.

224
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
You know?

225
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Uh-huh.

226
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Well, you live through it.

227
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
You really live through the 60s.

228
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
I think they're writing down.

229
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
1961.

230
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
If you turn it around, he was 1961.

231
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Oh, power.

232
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Yeah.

233
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Oh, that was such.

234
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
That was cool.

235
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
But then I, and you thought about, you know, wow.

236
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
What is it?

237
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
2000.

238
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
2000.

239
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
What if it's 2008?

240
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
My god.

241
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
That's so spacey.

242
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Yeah.

243
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Well, but we're living in space.

244
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
We are.

245
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,400
But if I look at all the equipment, all the gadgets and the connections and the email and mobile phone.

246
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
You would have told me that.

247
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Then I would have thought.

248
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
My man.

249
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,400
If we walk around the street with little earpieces talking to other people.

250
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Yeah.

251
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Yeah.

252
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Yeah.

253
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
It's amazing.

254
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
It's amazing.

255
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
What's possible, you know?

256
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Uh, I don't think it's on necessarily good.

257
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
I don't know.

258
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Because we're becoming pretty enslaved to all the stuff and all the stuff.

259
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
All the stuff and all the connections.

260
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
We have to get out once in a while.

261
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
You're good at that balance.

262
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
You know, balance.

263
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
I know.

264
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I'm always asking you to balance everything.

265
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Bye.

266
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Cool for your baby.

267
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
I love balance a little bit.

268
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,400
But if I, if I walk the street here in the streets in, um, your regular street.

269
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
My street.

270
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
In a gulf.

271
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
When you walk your street.

272
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I see these people.

273
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Everybody has a phone on any.

274
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
I noticed that the other day when we were shopping in the high street.

275
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Nobody is noticing anything anymore.

276
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Absolutely.

277
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:07,400
You know, you know, some, I think when we didn't have those those things at our ears,

278
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
we were looking at each other.

279
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,400
You know, you had, you were, you saw connection or you, you, you looked at each other or you,

280
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
you, you know,

281
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Good point.

282
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Yeah.

283
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Good point.

284
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Or you, or you saw that somebody was actually very handsome.

285
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Or what?

286
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
You know, I'm very good to, could, to dress her.

287
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Well, how to be honest.

288
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
I still look at people.

289
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
And I observed that stuff.

290
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Yeah.

291
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Look at you anymore.

292
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
No.

293
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
You're absolutely right.

294
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
I was, I was looking at that.

295
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
I was actually thinking two things at the time.

296
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Yeah.

297
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,400
You know, the high street is, um, it's almost like a 35 degree decline.

298
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
So you stand at the top of the high street.

299
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
You can kind of look all the way down.

300
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Yeah.

301
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,400
And you just saw scores of people on their phone either texting or talking.

302
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Everybody is in his own world.

303
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Yeah.

304
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
In their own little cone of size.

305
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Yeah.

306
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
And, and that just kind of, um,

307
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
walking around, you know,

308
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
just almost aimlessly.

309
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Yeah.

310
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
You're right.

311
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
And I was also thinking, fuck those guys must be making a lot of money.

312
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Yeah.

313
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I mean, you noticed, because we were in Guildford in, uh, in town.

314
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Mm-hmm.

315
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
There's afternoon.

316
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
I like to talk to the people.

317
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Mm-hmm.

318
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
I just start to talk to anybody.

319
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Oh, but surprisingly, when you speak to them.

320
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Walking next to me.

321
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Yeah.

322
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
When you speak to someone, they actually enjoy it.

323
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Yeah.

324
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
If it's something nice.

325
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Yeah.

326
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Yeah.

327
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Because it was a mother walking beautiful, beautiful red hair, uh, red hair daughter.

328
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
So, is she for sale?

329
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
She was gorgeous hair.

330
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
I'd like to find her for my husband.

331
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Flame of shut up.

332
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
The, the color just flamed in the beautiful.

333
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
That was nice color hair.

334
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Um, the sun was going down a little bit of winter sun.

335
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
You could see the beautiful red hair.

336
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
She was probably 17 years.

337
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Oh, really?

338
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
And I said to the mother.

339
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh, my god.

340
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Is there her own color?

341
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
It's beautiful.

342
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
She said, yeah, I got three daughters.

343
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
They all have red hair.

344
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
I said, it's amazing.

345
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Yeah.

346
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Yeah.

347
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Yeah.

348
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
And, you know, I like that.

349
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
I like it.

350
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Yeah.

351
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Yeah.

352
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
We were standing there next to, you know, just one of the traffic lights.

353
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Mm-hmm.

354
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
We're on red.

355
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
So, are you standing next to a stranger?

356
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,400
And we're all my thing on crazy.

357
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Wherever you are right now, whatever you're doing, I want you to pause this show.

358
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Just go ahead and put it on pause.

359
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,400
And I want you to make eye contact with someone in your direct vicinity.

360
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,400
So, if you're on the bus on the train, if you're in the car.

361
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Yeah.

362
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Just pause this right now and make direct eye contact with someone and smile.

363
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Look at them.

364
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Okay.

365
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Very good.

366
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Very good.

367
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Make sure you feel good.

368
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
It does make you feel good.

369
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Yeah, it does make you feel good.

370
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Yeah.

371
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Because otherwise, you feel so lonely.

372
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
You know?

373
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Ah, yes.

374
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
All right.

375
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
So, are we in here, it's right?

376
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Yeah.

377
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,400
So, wrapping up 2007, good year for you?

378
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Um, yes and no.

379
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
No.

380
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
No.

381
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Especially because I still miss my little cat.

382
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:59,400
And thanks for everybody who sent me beautiful condoluses and beautiful little stories.

383
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,400
There are lots of really beautiful stories that people even made.

384
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Yeah.

385
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
I had so much mail.

386
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Yeah.

387
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Thank you.

388
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Because it really helps.

389
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Yeah.

390
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Because you always feel lonely when you're, you know, sad.

391
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Yeah.

392
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
We still miss our pussy cat.

393
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
You miss us.

394
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
And you think nobody knows how I feel.

395
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
But people do know how you feel.

396
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Absolutely.

397
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Yeah.

398
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
You know, they had the same experience.

399
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,400
And I was, I'm still, I still miss them so, so much.

400
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Yeah.

401
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,400
You know, and I noticed that my cat, and I told you that before, it took months and months.

402
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
For ginger, the red one.

403
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Yeah.

404
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
He's best friend to get over this.

405
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,400
I think that the cat's more and so much.

406
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Oh, no kidding.

407
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
And his old face just.

408
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
It's gone.

409
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Yeah.

410
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
You know, it was not his face anymore.

411
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
So it's hard to, to have a little grin.

412
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
You know, it's coming back.

413
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Right.

414
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
It's coming back.

415
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Right.

416
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
But so ginger and I were very sad.

417
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Yeah.

418
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
Well, we're all very sad.

419
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Yeah.

420
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
So.

421
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Okay.

422
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
That was amazing.

423
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
That people just, you know.

424
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
So that was bad.

425
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
So it was bad and good at the same thing.

426
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Thinking about you is good.

427
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
That's nice.

428
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
So that was it.

429
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
And for the rest.

430
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,400
You know, I think the dancing was was wonderful.

431
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Good experience.

432
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Yeah.

433
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,400
I hope that when the weather is getting better, I would like to go out again and have a nice

434
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,400
walks and dance again because I'm actually waiting for my dance teacher.

435
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Are you waiting for the dance school to move back to the neighborhood?

436
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
It's too to the neighborhood.

437
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
It's such a lazy person.

438
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
It's too far.

439
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,400
It's too far to go for a half an hour and hour dance.

440
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Okay.

441
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
I wish I could dance with you.

442
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
But that's just never going to happen.

443
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:47,400
And especially the English people, you know, we just had a strictly condensing here.

444
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Just finished.

445
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Yeah.

446
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
And we had dancing with the stars for the Americans listening.

447
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Like the American.

448
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
And it was 9 million.

449
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
That's a lot for it.

450
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,400
But it was 13.9 almost 14 million for the Christmas East Enders episode.

451
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,400
But I have to say, we were like, you know, we sat down.

452
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
We were glued to the set.

453
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
We watched it.

454
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Yeah.

455
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
It was fantastic.

456
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
I've got to say, it's just great acting.

457
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
I really enjoy the acting.

458
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
The stories.

459
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
That's hard.

460
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
You know, it's not as bad as American soap operas.

461
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Well, what I like about East Enders and the acting is that the people who acted are so,

462
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
they look so real.

463
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
You know, they're not too beautiful.

464
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Like the American soap operas.

465
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
The people are so perfect.

466
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
And so beautiful.

467
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Yeah.

468
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
And so glamorous.

469
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
You know, their faces are lifted.

470
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
They're so gorgeous.

471
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
True.

472
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
And they never get old.

473
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
True.

474
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
But here they're real faces.

475
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Real people.

476
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Some people, some actors don't even have makeup on their faces.

477
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Really?

478
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
No.

479
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Oh, no.

480
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Nothing.

481
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
That's why you can have to see their red cheeks.

482
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
That's right.

483
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
When they get slapped.

484
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Yeah.

485
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Exactly.

486
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I like that.

487
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
It's a special sort of acting.

488
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Yeah.

489
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
You know, theatre.

490
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
It was a pretty good Christmas meeting.

491
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Theatre.

492
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Theatre.

493
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Theatre in East Enders.

494
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Yeah.

495
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I like that.

496
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
It was a good media Christmas.

497
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
I would have to say.

498
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Yeah.

499
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,400
So what I wanted to say is wrapping up 2007.

500
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Yeah.

501
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Wrap it up.

502
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
That means that.

503
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
You watch the dancing.

504
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Everybody's, oh, I'm going to do this.

505
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
But nobody does it.

506
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Right.

507
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
But actually, you should.

508
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Because I noticed that it is so cool.

509
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
It's fun and it's good for your body.

510
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
You feel much better.

511
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
And you lose a lot of weight.

512
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Hey, why don't we do a dancing show with you?

513
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Huh?

514
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Ha ha ha ha.

515
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm going to step back for your enthusiasm.

516
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Ha ha.

517
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Yeah.

518
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
I want to.

519
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Let's go.

520
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
I don't want to do a dancing show.

521
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Yeah.

522
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Where?

523
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
What do you mean?

524
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Something cool.

525
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
I mean, if, uh, I don't know.

526
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
That's very hard.

527
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Why is it hard?

528
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
I don't know.

529
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,400
I promise you'll get you one of the steady cams that goes around you in the opposite direction

530
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
of your twirling.

531
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Well, you know what?

532
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Maybe we could promise people if I go dancing again.

533
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Maybe I should bring a camera.

534
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Hmm.

535
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Okay.

536
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
That's a good one.

537
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Yeah.

538
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
You can see his dance in just normal.

539
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Just the time for me.

540
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Yeah.

541
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Just show normal people dancing.

542
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Yeah.

543
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
It could be fun.

544
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Yeah.

545
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Yeah.

546
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
And I wish you could dance with me.

547
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
But you're to touch.

548
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
It's the wrong length.

549
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
I wouldn't mind learning how to dance.

550
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
I know.

551
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
I know.

552
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I'm anxious to do a drive.

553
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Anxious.

554
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Yeah.

555
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
No.

556
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Are there cute tall chicks at these dancing schools?

557
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Uh.

558
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Because then I'll take it over.

559
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
No.

560
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
No.

561
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
No.

562
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
No.

563
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Well, who am I going to dance with then?

564
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Is there anyone in mind?

565
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
You should dance with me.

566
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Because when, when.

567
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Yeah.

568
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
In our dance, we have those couples.

569
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,400
We have only one who is by myself.

570
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Oh, by myself.

571
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
I have no partner.

572
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
You're looking at my belly button.

573
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
That's what I said.

574
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I explained that to my teachers.

575
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
That I can dance with my husband.

576
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
So you have no dancing.

577
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
The only thing we can do is laying down.

578
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
And how does that work for you?

579
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Fantastic.

580
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
God.

581
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
I want to play the hit test.

582
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
You want to play the hit test?

583
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
Okay.

584
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
This will be the last hit test of 2007.

585
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
So you remember it goes real fast, right?

586
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
No.

587
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
No.

588
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm not good at that.

589
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Okay.

590
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
You know, young actually does a video.

591
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
You want to see the video version of it?

592
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
I may actually be funnier.

593
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Oh, is that?

594
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Yeah.

595
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Let me see if I can get to it.

596
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Does he do video version?

597
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Yeah.

598
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
It's fucking crazy.

599
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
With him.

600
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Yes.

601
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
He got a seat.

602
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Oh, don't even know how he looks.

603
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
In the studio.

604
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
You want to see?

605
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
He's all right.

606
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,400
You know, he's not my type.

607
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Hold on.

608
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Let me see.

609
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I don't know if it'll play right away.

610
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
If I have the download of that.

611
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
I'll kind of suck.

612
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Let me see.

613
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Hold on.

614
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Let me turn.

615
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
I can turn the monitor.

616
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
So you can see it.

617
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
So it's 102 video.

618
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Oh, man.

619
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Is it MP4?

620
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Does that mean they'll take for fucking everybody to download?

621
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Oh, we'll see.

622
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Well, let me see.

623
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Let me see.

624
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
There we go.

625
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
It might work.

626
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Okay.

627
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
It's not moving, huh?

628
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Really?

629
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
You noticed.

630
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
All right.

631
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
We'll wait for that to start up.

632
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Well, anyway.

633
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Okay.

634
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Sorry about that.

635
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Yeah.

636
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
All right.

637
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Go ahead.

638
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Say something.

639
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Well, what I wanted to say is I noticed because I have a lot of information in my head, you know, throughout the years.

640
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,400
All the things that I know, all the names that I know, all the music, the songs, the singers, the groups.

641
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
I know so much.

642
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,400
And until we played the trivia spot the intro game.

643
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
That's what I wanted to say.

644
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
They didn't know shit.

645
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
I didn't know.

646
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Well, I couldn't come up with it.

647
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
A fast enough.

648
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,400
And that's because you're not using those names anymore.

649
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
You don't hear the music anymore.

650
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
It was all the way in the back of my head.

651
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
So let me just explain.

652
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,400
I bought this game called Spot the intro.

653
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,400
And it's like a musical trivia game.

654
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Yeah.

655
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
And it's all right.

656
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
You know, the five different categories.

657
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,400
You go around a board with your little dude.

658
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
And you know, East time you land on a spot.

659
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
You could five questions every question.

660
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
You answer right you move ahead one.

661
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,400
And that's a really, you know, they said it was from 14 ages 14 and up.

662
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
But it was.

663
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
We played with Christina.

664
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
But I have to see.

665
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
She knows a lot.

666
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Yeah.

667
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Yeah.

668
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
She absolutely does.

669
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Yeah.

670
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
She does.

671
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
I was amazed.

672
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
I was amazed to see her.

673
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
I fucked this one.

674
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Yeah.

675
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Yeah.

676
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
I'll show it to you next time.

677
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I'm counting casting with Adam Curry.

678
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Hey, Adam.

679
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
You ready to be stumped.

680
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
Hell.

681
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Good.

682
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
He used that.

683
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Fantastic.

684
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
With young pull back.

685
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Hey, Adam.

686
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
This is, he tests number 102.

687
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,400
And we're going to start right away with intro number one.

688
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Yeah.

689
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
You should know that one.

699
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
No.

700
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Number 2.

701
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400

702
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,400

717
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Hey,有, problem.

718
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
Now we've shot it.

719
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:41,400
And so number one from 1982, Eye of the Tiger, Survivor.

720
00:22:41,400 --> 00:23:03,400
I have the Tiger Survivor, answer number one, and this is answer number two.

721
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,400
From 1988, Jenny H. Jazz, turn back to clock.

722
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,400
I want to say her hospital.

723
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,400
And I still can't smoke, I wish that I could turn back the clock.

724
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,400
One, there you go.

725
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Did you mention, if you want to be with me, that's fine.

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
I'll tell you.

727

Yeah, of course.

728

And to number two, Jenny H. Jazz, and this is answer number three.

729
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,400
From 1990, this is Phil Collins, something happened on the way to heaven.

730
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Wow, this is good.

731
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Yeah, but you recognize Phil Collins sound.

732
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
I smell the jazz.

733
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:04,400
You can run, and you can run, but you're living.

734
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,400

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
So much fun.

747
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,400
I do recognize him, but I don't know what.

748
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
Like, oh yeah, I know that.

749
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
I know that.

750
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Well, it's interesting because, of course, I told the story about Simone.

751
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
So that's why he put, I knew that.

752
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,400
And I was thinking, is that Johnny is just, I didn't know for sure.

753
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
I was like, turn back the time.

754
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
I recognize him.

755
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
And I actually have queued up as the,

756
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Yeah, you were pointing out.

757
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,400
And I had queued up, I want to play you the pod safe version of Shadow Dreams.

758
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Oh, good.

759
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Because he put it up.

760
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Simone and Clark put up.

761
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Shadow Dreams.

762
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
It's a whole different version.

763
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
So I want you to hear that.

764
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,400
And we'll play it in a couple minutes.

765
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,400
So yeah, I thought it was, I knew it was full content.

766
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
I didn't know.

767
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Somebody should actually do that again.

768
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
That's all.

769
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
That's a great song.

770
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Which one?

771
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Turn back the clock.

772
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Really?

773
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Yeah, yeah.

774
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Somebody should cover that.

775
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Well, maybe Clark will do it himself in a different version.

776
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
I don't think that works, because

777
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
You don't think it works?

778
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Did he did Shadow Dreams?

779
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
I know.

780
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
But he's old enough.

781
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,400
And if you see them on TV, you think.

782
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
You know.

783
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
You're brushing young group.

784
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,400
But if he's doing that, but he's doing a whole different version.

785
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
So it would be, I agree with you.

786
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Yeah.

787
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
That if he did kind of like a new uptemperal solution.

788
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
For example.

789
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
A girl's allowed me to random.

790
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Yes, something like that.

791
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
With a sprinkle of pojo.

792
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:19,400
They do, they do all those covers.

793
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
They always covers.

794
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Yeah, but everybody's covering old stuff from the 80s.

795
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
They do.

796
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
From the early early 80s.

797
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Yeah, that's true.

798
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Okay, but we'll play it later.

799
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
And then you tell me what you think.

800
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
I think it turned out it's good.

801
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Yeah.

802
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
I like it.

803
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
What's that?

804
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
What's that?

805
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
You?

806
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Well, I was thinking about that.

807
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
I had a visual of that picture that you showed me with all the hair.

808
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Yeah.

809
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Clark.

810
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,400
He looks like he looks like a hippie.

811
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
He does a little bit.

812
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
Oh, not bad.

813
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
No, he's a good looking guy.

814
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Good looking guy.

815
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Yeah.

816
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Hey, don't get too enthusiastic.

817
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
No.

818
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Oh, you're not jealous.

819
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Never.

820
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
What are we going to do in 2008, darling?

821
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
What are your dreams?

822
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
What are your wishes?

823
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
What are your desires?

824
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,400
I'll wave my magic wand and make them all come true.

825
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Well, the main thing is I would like to feel great.

826
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
You know, good.

827
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
No pains.

828
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
No nothing.

829
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
No.

830
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Because the last six months has been a little bit.

831
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
A little painful.

832
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Yeah.

833
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Yeah.

834
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
I don't want that because it's a bit too.

835
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Nothing serious.

836
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
It's just.

837
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,400
No, but it's too early to get to have pains to get older and have pain.

838
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,400
So I really have to work at that because as long as you move and move and move,

839
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
that's the best thing you can do.

840
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
Yeah.

841
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
So I promise that to myself.

842
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Okay.

843
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
So keep on moving.

844
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
All right.

845
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
So healthy.

846
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Health.

847
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Health on top.

848
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
If you don't have your health, what do you do?

849
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I mean, you know, people don't realize that until you're sick.

850
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Oh, I got a fuck man.

851
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
I can't do shit.

852
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Yeah, really.

853
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Remember when you have the flu.

854
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
No, imagine you're doing something else.

855
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
I had a couple of folds.

856
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
You know, I'm a bit of wild.

857
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
My problem.

858
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,400
You're too wild for the fragility of your frame.

859
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
I know.

860
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Maybe some other people who are listening right now have the same problem as I have.

861
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,400
I, in my head, I don't accept that my body is a little bit older.

862
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,400
You know, and I do everything too fast and too wild and too.

863
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,400
And I'm running around and I'm running on this, you know, dude, I even have that.

864
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
What are you talking about?

865
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
And I think I'm, what am I doing?

866
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
This is not good.

867
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
So what happened a couple of times.

868
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,400
I was in the kitchen and the floor was wet.

869
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
And then I, you know, go around to corner.

870
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,400
And I fall so hard on my back.

871
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Now normally when you're younger, you jump up and you think I'm shit.

872
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Boiling.

873
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
No problem.

874
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
I'm probably jumping your bones up and you go, you know.

875
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
But it's not possible.

876
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
I'm broken up with the fuck.

877
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
I don't know.

878
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Yeah.

879
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
So I probably, I don't know what happened.

880
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,400
But it's like, I damaged something in my backyard and anything.

881
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
But I didn't want to notice it.

882
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,400
I didn't want to pay any attention to it.

883
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
So that's my problem.

884
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
I think other people have their two.

885
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
I'm too young in my head.

886
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,400
But my, I forget about my body, you know.

887
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
The bones, especially the bones.

888
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,400
So in 2008, we're going to see lots of things change.

889
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Oh, at the end of 2008, we'll have a new president in the White House.

890
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Yeah.

891
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
What are things going to happen?

892
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,400
There's a lot of stuff going on in the world right now that I,

893
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,400
So he's, I never, well, sometimes we talk about it again.

894
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
So he's, I don't like him.

895
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
You don't like him.

896
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
I don't like his face.

897
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,400
Who?

898
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
For Bush.

899
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Well, don't worry.

900
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
He has no chance of winning.

901
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
So I don't like, for you.

902
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
He's not getting in the race.

903
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
I try to like him.

904
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,400
I really tried.

905
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
But I can't.

906
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Yeah, but I can't.

907
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
I have no law for him.

908
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Yeah, but it really doesn't matter.

909
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,400
What has to happen now is actually something you said earlier.

910
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
And I'm not talking about the things he's doing.

911
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
I'm not talking about war.

912
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
I'm not talking.

913
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
I'm talking about his personality.

914
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
I'm talking about the person.

915
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
His aura.

916
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
His aura.

917
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
His aura.

918
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Right.

919
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
From the beginning, I really tried.

920
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,400
I thought maybe he's going to do something or maybe he's going to, you know,

921
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
I have to say, did you see the Ellen?

922
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Did you notice?

923
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Yeah, where his, uh, one of his daughters was on Ellen and then called.

924
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Oh, I didn't.

925
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Was that good?

926
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,400
I have to say it was, um, fun.

927
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
It has nothing.

928
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
It really has nothing to do with it.

929
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
I'll tell you.

930
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
I want to look it up on YouTube.

931
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
But that's not her father.

932
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
What do you mean?

933
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
No.

934
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
What?

935
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
You said his daughter.

936
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Yeah.

937
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
George Bush's daughter.

938
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Yeah.

939
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
I don't know whoever it was.

940
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
It's not George.

941
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
What?

942
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
No, no.

943
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
But she, thank you.

944
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Yeah.

945
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Okay.

946
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Good point.

947
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Yeah.

948
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Yeah.

949
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
She called.

950
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Yeah.

951
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
She had fun story.

952
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
That's funny.

953
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
No, no.

954
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
She called him.

955
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Okay.

956
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Yeah.

957
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Let me show you.

958
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Check this out.

959
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
You got your glasses on?

960
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Yeah.

961
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Okay.

962
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Watch this.

963
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
You'll see.

964
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
It was actually quite endearing.

965
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Take a look at what happened yesterday during a taping of the Ellen DeGeneres show.

966
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Thank you, Matt.

967
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Could you just pick up the phone like right now and call him?

968
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Sure.

969
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
Okay.

970
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
You're going to kill me, though.

971
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Maybe.

972
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Oh, did you say hi?

973
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
You think I'm allowed to do this?

974
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Why not?

975
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
You're his daughter.

976
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
You're going to get in trouble?

977
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
At this point, Ellen is thinking, holy crap.

978
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
This is going to be so fucking cool.

979
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
This is going to be on YouTube in a minute.

980
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,400
I'm going to get George Bush on the phone.

981
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Yeah.

982
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Just hit the see if you have a downtown hit nine.

983
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
She had it all set up.

984
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
She had the phone there.

985
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Number anything.

986
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
No, no, no.

987
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
I'm covering that.

988
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
Nobody's even looking.

989
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
I'm not even looking.

990
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
I don't want to get in trouble.

991
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
I couldn't really.

992
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
No.

993
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
I just want to say hi.

994
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Okay.

995
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
I'm calling.

996
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
I'll call you.

997
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
I'll call you.

998
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Okay.

999
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
I'm going to get anything.

1000
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
This way.

1001
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
This way.

1002
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
This way.

1003
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Give me a kill.

1004
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
I'm going to be in so much trouble.

1005
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Why wouldn't they want to say hi to everybody and say hi to everybody and say hi to everybody

1006
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
because it's more mean.

1007
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
It's pretty funny.

1008
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Hey, Hannah.

1009
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Hi, Mom.

1010
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,400
Hey, I'm not watching you because you're just taping right.

1011
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Yes, but what are you doing then?

1012
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,400
I'm getting sitting here with Daddy.

1013
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Oh, hey.

1014
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I said.

1015
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
I want to say hi to Daddy.

1016
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Okay.

1017
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
Check it out.

1018
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Hello, President Bush.

1019
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
How are you?

1020
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
This is Ellen Degeneresho.

1021
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Ellen's great.

1022
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Ellen's great.

1023
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Ellen's great.

1024
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Ellen's got my little girl, too.

1025
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Oh, she's great.

1026
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
She's scared.

1027
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:40,400
She was going to get in trouble because I just said is it easy to just pick up the phone and call

1028
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
you dad any time.

1029
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
She said yes.

1030
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
And I said, okay.

1031
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
Well, then let's call him and she goes, oh.

1032
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
And now she's scared.

1033
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,400
She's not going to get any Christmas presents.

1034
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Dad?

1035
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Yes, baby.

1036
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Are you mad?

1037
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
No, not at all.

1038
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Okay, good.

1039
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
See?

1040
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Oh.

1041
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
And it's okay, Ellen.

1042
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,400
All right, look, they were showing a picture of you holding their daughters when

1043
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
they were just born.

1044
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
That's beautiful.

1045
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
The best day of your life.

1046
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Remember, Dad?

1047
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,400
She is so cute.

1048
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
So the ending is not here.

1049
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
But at the end, he says, I love you, darling.

1050
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Merry Christmas.

1051
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
I have to say.

1052
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Yeah, but you know what he's saying.

1053
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Yeah.

1054
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Why are you taking off your head for me?

1055
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

1056
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Yeah, it was a little bit less.

1057
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Okay, stop.

1058
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Stop.

1059
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
That was the most unprofessional thing you've ever known on the show.

1060
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
I know.

1061
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Oh.

1062
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Take off your pants.

1063
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Okay.

1064
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Show it.

1065
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Hey.

1066
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
But do you see how she's a bit scared of him?

1067
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Oh, yeah.

1068
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Oh, yeah.

1069
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Oh, yeah.

1070
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
I afraid I'm not going to get any Christmas presents.

1071
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Oh, yeah.

1072
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
The first came out of the mouth.

1073
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Yeah.

1074
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Yeah.

1075
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Okay.

1076
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Well, good acting then.

1077
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
I would have to say.

1078
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
What does Matt Lauer say?

1079
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
He's scared.

1080
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Yeah.

1081
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
You know, that's a good point.

1082
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
She was absolutely terrified.

1083
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,400
She thought I think it's fun, but I'm maybe my dad doesn't think it's fun.

1084
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Let's see what Matt says.

1085
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
Let me see.

1086
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
Let me see.

1087
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Let me see.

1088
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Let me see.

1089
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
I didn't want her right after that.

1090
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Exactly.

1091
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Exactly.

1092
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Okay.

1093
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Good point.

1094
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
That's a good point.

1095
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Matt said, he probably like hammered her right after that.

1096
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Yeah.

1097
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
All right.

1098
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Okay.

1099
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
But still.

1100
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
You know.

1101
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
So.

1102
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Yeah.

1103
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Yeah.

1104
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,400
I mean, what I was going to say is what I agree with what you said earlier

1105
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,400
is that we need to.

1106
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Oh, it sounds so sought off.

1107
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
What?

1108
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
You need to stop and smell the flowers.

1109
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,400
You know, people got a, you got to balance yourself.

1110
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,400
We're, as a society, we're fucked up.

1111
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
We're in a, in a very.

1112
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
There is a fucked up spiral.

1113
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
We can't actually see what's going on around us.

1114
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
I mean, you're really perceptive.

1115
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
You look at that and I'm thinking, you know, how cute.

1116
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
You can say, yeah, but look how terrified she was.

1117
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
But we can't even see that stuff anymore.

1118
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Yeah.

1119
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Because we're so inundated with happiness and the way it's supposed to be.

1120
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,400
So hunting success.

1121
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,400
And you know, this is the way my parents used to talk on it when I was young.

1122
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,400
And we just sound that old like old fox.

1123
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Really?

1124
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Did they?

1125
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Well, they didn't enjoy life.

1126
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,400
No, but you know how old people say back in the day when I was young.

1127
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
It was also different.

1128
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Isn't that exactly what we're doing?

1129
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
And I know you hate that when people do that.

1130
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Yeah, it's not exactly what we're doing.

1131
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
But this because you cannot think back.

1132
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
There is nothing there.

1133
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
You don't get it.

1134
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,400
You don't understand anything.

1135
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
I do.

1136
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
What are they talking about?

1137
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
You know, I do.

1138
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Yeah.

1139
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Yeah.

1140
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
You mean.

1141
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Yeah.

1142
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Yeah.

1143
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
You know.

1144
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:49,400
I think anyone over the age of 30 should pretty much understand what the fuck we're talking about.

1145
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Yeah.

1146
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
I should do something about it.

1147
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Because it's not going to get any better.

1148
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,400
We have to go back to old fashion.

1149
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Enjoy.

1150
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Or geez.

1151
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Back to the, let's go back to the 60s.

1152
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Yeah.

1153
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Yeah.

1154
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Make love.

1155
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Let's make love.

1156
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
It's not worth it.

1157
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
It's not worth it.

1158
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
Yeah.

1159
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
I can't.

1160
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
I can't.

1161
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
I can't.

1162
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
I didn't.

1163
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
It doesn't work.

1164
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
No.

1165
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
It doesn't.

1166
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
It doesn't.

1167
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
No.

1168
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,400
What I wanted to say is, yeah, just, you know, notice each other a little bit more.

1169
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Yeah.

1170
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
You know.

1171
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Bye.

1172
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Bye.

1173
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
All right.

1174
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
You hear it already?

1175
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
It's the new version.

1176
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
And it's now a pod save.

1177
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Clock Dutchless shatter dreams.

1178
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,400
So much for your promises.

1179
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:45,400
They died the day you let me go.

1180
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Cut up and wherever lies.

1181
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,400
But it was just to lay down alone.

1182
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,400
I thought it was you.

1183
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,400
You said they died.

1184
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
For me.

1185
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,400
And just see you giving me.

1186
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
Give them me.

1187
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Nothing but shatter dreams.

1188
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Shatter dreams.

1189
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Feel like I could run away.

1190
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Run away.

1191
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,400
From this empty heart.

1192
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Welcome to reality.

1193
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Unfound the future.

1194
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Not so bright.

1195
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,400
I dreamt the impossible.

1196
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
The name is made.

1197
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,400
It's good for a cow bright.

1198
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,400
I thought it was you.

1199
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,400
You said they died.

1200
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
For me.

1201
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,400
And just see you giving me.

1202
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Give them me.

1203
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Nothing but shatter dreams.

1204
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Shatter dreams.

1205
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Feel like I could run away.

1206
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Run away.

1207
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,400
From this empty heart.

1208
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,400
You know you give them me.

1209
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Nothing but shatter dreams.

1210
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Shatter dreams.

1211
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Feel like I could run away.

1212
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Run away.

1213
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,400
From this empty heart.

1214
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:10,400
I thought it was you.

1215
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Who said they died.

1216
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
For me.

1217
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,400
And just see you giving me.

1218
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Give them me.

1219
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Nothing but shatter dreams.

1220
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Shatter dreams.

1221
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Feel like I could run away.

1222
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Run away.

1223
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,400
From this empty heart.

1224
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,400
You know you give them me.

1225
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Give them me.

1226
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Nothing but shatter dreams.

1227
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Shatter dreams.

1228
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Feel like I could run away.

1229
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Run away.

1230
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,400
From this empty heart.

1231
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:01,400
I thought it was you.

1232
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Who said they died.

1233
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
For me.

1234
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
From this empty heart.

1235
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,400
You know you give them me.

1236
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
You know you give them me.

1237
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
You know you give them me.

1238
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
You know you give them me.

1239
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,400
You know you give them me.

1240
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,400
I dream the impossible.

1241
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Come on, let's dream the impossible.

1242
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Who you give them me.

1243
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Dream the impossible.

1244
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Let's dream the impossible.

1245
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,400
I like this version.

1246
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,400
But it was nothing wrong with the old version.

1247
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
Yeah there was.

1248
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
It's owned by his former record label.

1249
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Of course there's something wrong with it.

1250
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,400
So you can't just put that on his new album without paying them.

1251
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Probably bastards.

1252
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
It's still incredible so it's beautiful.

1253
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,400
I love the woke up to reality and saw the future wasn't so bright.

1254
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
It's one of a kind.

1255
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
It's one of a kind.

1256
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
It certainly is.

1257
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
I could have had some some soulful girls in the background there.

1258
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Yeah.

1259
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Just a little bit.

1260
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
I know this is his sound but.

1261
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Foistills sounds.

1262
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,400
Sound yeah it's good.

1263
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Yeah it's good.

1264
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
He probably played all of most of the instruments.

1265
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,400
We did the production or whatever.

1266
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Yeah.

1267
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
It's so easy to do.

1268
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
Very good.

1269
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
Good.

1270
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Great song.

1271
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,400
Clark Dashwell.

1272
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
It does.

1273
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Clark Dashwell has a CD out.

1274
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
What's it called?

1275
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Let's take a look at it for a second.

1276
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Clark Dashwell.

1277
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
No no it's called tomorrow tomorrow.

1278
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Tomorrow.

1279
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Yes.

1280
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
But that song is not on it.

1281
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,400
No.

1282
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
It was a different tomorrow on it.

1283
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,400
But he all the lyrics.

1284
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
I was reading a little bit.

1285
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,400
He's very earthy.

1286
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,400
He's very earthy.

1287
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,400
Yeah definitely.

1288
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Yeah.

1289
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
He wants to save the world.

1290
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
That's why I like about him.

1291
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
He wants to save the world.

1292
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Yeah.

1293
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
In his own way.

1294
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
It's not going for the money.

1295
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Just great music.

1296
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
Yeah.

1297
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Yeah.

1298
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
I think I think you're right.

1299
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
The record business is fucked up.

1300
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
But the music business is still is pretty good.

1301
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
There's a lot going on.

1302
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
There's a lot of shit happening.

1303
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Yeah.

1304
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,400
So you can buy a CD.

1305
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
I think off their site.

1306
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
So.

1307
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
All right, baby.

1308
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
So 2008.

1309
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
We've gotten health.

1310
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Anything else?

1311
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Creativity.

1312
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
Oh yes.

1313
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Yeah.

1314
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
You need that.

1315
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,400
Because of how everybody feels at the moment.

1316
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,400
I think that a lot of people are very creative at the moment.

1317
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,400
Really?

1318
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,400
I think so.

1319
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Interesting.

1320
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
Yeah.

1321
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
Because of creative stuff.

1322
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Really?

1323
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,400
Yeah.

1324
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,400
But it's from the revolutionaries, right?

1325
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
It's from the people who are rising to the top.

1326
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,400
We're breaking through the matrix of insanity.

1327
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
I think it's because of the internet.

1328
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,400
You can feel and hear more things going on.

1329
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
And people with.

1330
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400
Yeah.

1331
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
You know, does their talents more?

1332
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Yeah, but you also got to make sure that you get out and walk the fucking

1333
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Street or do something.

1334
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
I know.

1335
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
That's pretty important.

1336
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,400
No, but especially even if you just walk in.

1337
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,400
Because this is normal here in Guilford.

1338
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
We have this high street.

1339
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,400
And there are a lot of musicians are playing there.

1340
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Yeah, that's right.

1341
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,400
And I'm standing there.

1342
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,400
And my mouth is open.

1343
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,400
I mean, I'm listening to them.

1344
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
And they're so gifted.

1345
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
And they're so.

1346
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,400
The great musicians.

1347
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
I can't wait to take you to a central park.

1348
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
I haven't seen it myself.

1349
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
But David Epolito.

1350
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
The guitar man from Central Park.

1351
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Oh yeah.

1352
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
I'm not in the winter.

1353
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
But he does a concert every Sunday.

1354
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Same thing.

1355
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Oh yeah.

1356
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,400
Thousands of people show up.

1357
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
Yeah.

1358
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
He actually makes some kind of a little bit of that.

1359
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Sorry.

1360
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
There's so many talented people.

1361
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,400
And where do they go?

1362
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,400
Yeah.

1363
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,400
Well, that's exactly what's happening.

1364
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,400
I mean, you don't need to have millions and millions and millions of people

1365
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,400
going to your shows or buying records or your t-shirts or being a general fan.

1366
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,400
You need that anymore.

1367
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,400
Because there's no record company that's going to take away 95% of that.

1368
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
97%.

1369
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
No.

1370
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
After recouping all the costs.

1371
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,400
So.

1372
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,400
I'm not going to invest in you anymore.

1373
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,400
Well, they're not.

1374
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,400
No.

1375
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
No, they're not.

1376
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,400
I noticed that.

1377
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,400
Did you just burp?

1378
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,400
Yeah.

1379
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,400
Well, you know, I was thinking.

1380
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,400
Let it go.

1381
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Well, you know, I burp because I was thinking about my own record balls.

1382
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
This is Patricia.

1383
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,400
You have to know that I can say things.

1384
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
I can say just a word to her.

1385
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,400
And she or a name or a name of a person.

1386
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,400
And I start to burp.

1387
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,400
And she will start to burp.

1388
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
It comes up.

1389
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,400
I'm throwing up in my mouth.

1390
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,400
Arco.

1391
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,400
I'm trying to get, I'm trying to get you to burp.

1392
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
No.

1393
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
Did you just say you threw up in your mouth?

1394
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
No.

1395
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,400
It's true.

1396
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,400
I was thinking about my own record company balls.

1397
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,400
And I thought, oh.

1398
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
It's no business there, baby.

1399
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Where there's no business.

1400
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,400
There's nothing happening.

1401
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,400
It's over.

1402
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
And I know ideas.

1403
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,400
And then he doesn't answer.

1404
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,400
And then some of you comes with his ideas.

1405
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
Who are not that good.

1406
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,400
You know, anything that doesn't cost any money.

1407
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,400
Yeah, but you know, you're on the internet all fucking day.

1408
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
I mean, that's not entirely true.

1409
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,400
But you're really good at finding stuff.

1410
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
You're surfing around.

1411
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,400
You're looking at medical information.

1412
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
You're finding shit on YouTube.

1413
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,400
You know, in fact, you're doing everything except going to podshow.com.

1414
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Your sister actually, you know, checks out shows from the world.

1415
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,400
What did you check out?

1416
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,400
Well, I'm listening to big bands.

1417
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,400
You know, I was.

1418
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
I know emailed you that file.

1419
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
You didn't.

1420
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,400
Stop.

1421
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
Anyway, doesn't matter.

1422
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
You know, these people are out there.

1423
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,400
How many tons of people have sent you ideas and want to work with you?

1424
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
But you don't, you can't.

1425
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,400
Or you don't want to connect with them to do so.

1426
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,400
I mean, it could be done now.

1427
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,400
It's just not the way you're used to doing stuff.

1428
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,400
No.

1429
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,400
It can be done in across the world.

1430
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,400
You don't have to be in the same spaces as a person to create to something.

1431
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
You know, certainly you like making music.

1432
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,400
No, you.

1433
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
Yeah.

1434
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,400
But I think what I like the most is working with the producer.

1435
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
It's working with the producer.

1436
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Performing.

1437
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:26,400
I'm not somebody that's going to sit behind my desk with a mic.

1438
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,400
And then seeing and feels so good at the end of the day.

1439
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
That's not enough for me.

1440
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,400
I thought you really like making records.

1441
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,400
So you like making the hoarding in the studio.

1442
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,400
According to the studio.

1443
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:43,400
But what I noticed is that I do miss some creativity on stage or something or doing something

1444
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,400
and getting a reaction.

1445
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,400
Panto.

1446
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,400
You could do panto.

1447
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,400
Nobody asked me.

1448
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
You would be great for fucking panto.

1449
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,400
I know.

1450
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,400
We got to go.

1451
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,400
It's too late now.

1452
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Next year, let's go watch a panto.

1453
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,400
You would be great in a panto.

1454
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,400
No, they're a couple here in town.

1455
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,400
That would be perfect for you.

1456
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,400
No.

1457
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,400
You would be a big bit.

1458
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Look at bigans.

1459
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,400
For those of you in America.

1460
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,400
You have no idea what the hell we're talking about.

1461
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,400
Yeah.

1462
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,400
Panto is like this tradition.

1463
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,400
And of the best actors.

1464
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,400
It does a matter.

1465
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
Well, but it's a panto mind.

1466
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,400
Is that what they call it?

1467
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,400
No, it's not.

1468
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,400
But it comes from panto mind.

1469
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,400
But it's actually there.

1470
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
It's singing and speaking and.

1471
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,400
The stories.

1472
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,400
What is the story?

1473
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,400
And what's the deal with the Lobsters?

1474
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,400
Yeah.

1475
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
I don't know.

1476
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,400
We don't know.

1477
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,400
We don't know.

1478
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,400
Because we never been to one.

1479
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,400
But they say fairy tales.

1480
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,400
Yeah.

1481
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,400
And it's Christmas.

1482
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,400
And they bring sort of fairy tales.

00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
It doesn't matter how big you are.

1490
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400

00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,400
I'm woking.

1505
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,400
And it was somebody else.

1506
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,400
Some deals.

1507
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,400
I was doing a panto.

1508
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
Woking's like.

1509
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,400
New work.

1510
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,400
Not a sattro.

1511
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,400
But there are a couple of Americans.

1512
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,400
Right.

1513
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,400
So you can do a panto.

1514
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
There's all kinds of stuff you can do.

1515
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,400
You just got to do it.

1516
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,400
They're going to do something creative this year.

1517
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,400
You're going to you're going to wait for some show in Holland.

1518
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
I promise to do something.

1519
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
I'm thinking I have a couple of plans in my head.

1520
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,400
And I hope to.

1521
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
To do.

1522
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,400
Just tell me what you'd really like to do.

1523
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
So we've narrowed it down to performing.

1524
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,400
So you'd like to perform.

1525
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,400
What do you want to do?

1526
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,400
You want to have a big band.

1527
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,400
I think it's on the cabaret kind of a thing.

1528
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Cabaret with with jokes.

1529
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,400
No, no.

1530
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,400
What do you mean cabaret?

1531
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,400
Very.

1532
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,400
Means a band singing.

1533
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,400
Right.

1534
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,400
It's sort of a movie kind of Hollywood kind of atmosphere.

1535
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,400
I'm thinking about it.

1536
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,400
I got it.

1537
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,400
What?

1538
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
I know exactly.

1539
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
I know how to fucking do this.

1540
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,400

1541
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,400

Next door.

1544
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,400

1545
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,400
Who's that?

1546
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,400
Who's that?

1547
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,400
The guy who owns Harper's?

1548
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1549
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,400
He has a nightclub.

1550
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,400
He can take 2,000 people.

1551
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,400
It's unbelievable.

1552
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,400
I've never even been inside.

1553
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:23,400
He had a, he gave us his car to drive home one night from the Christmas party, actually.

1554
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,400
But think about it.

1555
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,400
Yeah.

1556
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,400
What an amazing show you could put on there.

1557
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,400
And he has the dough to do it.

1558
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,400
Maybe at the.

1559
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,400
You could find answers.

1560
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,400
Yeah, but halfway the year.

1561
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,400
He maybe really make money.

1562
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,400
Starting to have maybe a sort of a thing together.

1563
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,400
And we could come to England or in Guildford and try it out here.

1564
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,400
Why don't we also.

1565
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
Because the arrangements you need anyway.

1566
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,400
So you're getting your arrangements.

1567
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,400
Why don't we, why don't we take a look at there must be a big man here in the neighborhood.

1568
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,400
This got to be.

1569
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,400
We got a fucking music academy here.

1570
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,400
Are you kidding me?

1571
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,400
This, this, what a perfect set of.

1572
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,400
Well, if I have the arrangement, we can do it anywhere.

1573
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,400
Yeah.

1574
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,400
With any.

1575
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,400
I'm going to talk.

1576
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,400
I'm going to talk to Super Agent Keith.

1577
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,400
No, I'm going to talk to Keith.

1578
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
I'm going to talk to Keith to talk to Harper about it.

1579
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,400
He's asking me our agent that's Agent asking me.

1580
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,400
But if you want something, is there something.

1581
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,400
What would you like to wish for?

1582
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,400
Look, we'll have.

1583
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,400
That's what Harper will pay for it.

1584
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,400
Keith will set it up.

1585
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,400
We'll make do a limited, a limited run.

1586
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,400
You know, you do a couple nights with a with a great band.

1587
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,400
You know, we'll have him get the arrangements together.

1588
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,400
And do a great show in a real night club right next fucking door.

1589
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,640
I mean, literally, I can drive you, drop you off,

1590
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,200
come on, uh, uh, buy, I'll pick you up later.

1591
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,560
You don't give us, you don't need to make money.

1592
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,560
I didn't give a shit about that.

1593
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,840
You just want to do it, right?

1594
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,840
He'll make money.

1595
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,840
It'll be fantastic.

1596
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,680
I pay him.

1597
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,040
No, shh.

1598
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,560
Don't give him any ideas.

1599
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,400
That's not good.

1600
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:49,920
Cool.

1601
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,080
And then, and Pod Show will video it.

1602
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:52,720
Yeah.

1603
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,080
And, uh, now listen to me.

1604
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,360
This is a great idea.

1605
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,760
So we'll, you know, we'll, we'll shoot it.

1606
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,040
We'll do a multi-camera shoot.

1607
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,360
And then, uh, we'll, fuck, we'll release a DVD if it's that good.

1608
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,600
Or release put it online.

1609
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,600
Yep.

1610
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,920
How about that?

1611
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,920
Great.

1612
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,920
Are you serious?

1613
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,920
I'm sorry.

1614
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:14,480
I'm telling you he'll love it.

1615
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,480
Yep.

1616
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,320
He'll love it.

1617
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,320
Okay.

1618
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,160
Well, we have a project already.

1619
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,160
Gosh, dang it.

1620
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,280
Well, they, we got a project to work on.

1621
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,280
I'm doing it.

1622
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,840
I just got excited all of sudden.

1623
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,440
See how easy it is folks?

1624
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,680
That's how easy it is.

1625
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,240
Just go, make it happen.

1626
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,440
And you don't know what, I don't need anything.

1627
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,680
My, my instrument is in here.

1628
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,680
Yes.

1629
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,280
And I will examine your instrument a little bit later.

1630
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,280
Stop it.

1631
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,920
Open up and say, ah, so I can look at your instrument.

1632
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,920
Yes.

1633
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,280
Oh, look my instrument fits in your instrument.

1634
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,920
Stop it now.

1635
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,920
All right, Debbie.

1636
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,360
Thank you very much for closing out the year on the, on the, on the,

1637
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,360
this source code.

1638
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,360
I had fun.

1639
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,360
It's awesome.

1640
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,360
Yes, I am.

1641
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,360
You're still naughty.

1642
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,360
Yes, I try.

1643
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,360
After all these.

1644
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,160
Oh, shit, that's all I got left.

1645
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,480
That, that are my enormous knob.

1646
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,040
So combined, it's pretty good.

1647
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,200
All the rest is just filler, all the stuff in between.

1648
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,320
It's just dropping me up.

1649
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,240
You know what I noticed when I was doing it.

1650
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,240
And we're just babbling a little bit.

1651
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,080
Yeah.

1652
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,200
You're so much more, you're so funny.

1653
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,680
I know you can be so funny.

1654
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,840
And the listeners don't know that.

1655
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,840
But in the house and you, you were thus, you know, in the family.

1656
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,840
I don't know if I'm going to like this story.

1657
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,680
You, you are so funny.

1658
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,080
Without the mic.

1659
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,800
You are so, you have it now.

1660
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,520
When you're sitting with me, it's coming out of the mouth.

1661
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,880
Oh, it's so, what you, I'm just talking about.

1662
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,720
Oh, you're all by yourself.

1663
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,120
You're always so, so serious.

1664
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,920
And I'm listening here, you know.

1665
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,080
Listen, you know, you know, I, you know,

1666
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:42,920
that fucking door.

1667
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,920
I don't think, what the,

1668
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
I don't think it's something.

1669
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,920
I don't think it's something.

1670
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,520
It's always so boring.

1671
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,320
It's really, really, thank you.

1672
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,280
That, you know, that really, that's all thanks, baby.

1673
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,360
I just feel great now.

1674
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,360
I'm sitting, you're asking for naked pictures.

1675
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,160
I'm, you know, I'm not always serious.

1676
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,200
Oh, I didn't hear that.

1677
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,040
Why never get any.

1678
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,480
Otherwise, you would have known about it.

1679
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,920
No one ever sends me any fucking naked.

1680
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,880
In fact, it's only guys calling me lightly.

1681
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,040
It's a little concerning.

1682
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,320
Oh, yeah, it is.

1683
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,320
Thanks.

1684
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,000
There's no women calling it.

1685
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,840
I don't know if any women are listening to this show.

1686
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,840
You're perfect.

1687
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,920
Just middle age, guys.

1688
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,840
Make it picture.

1689
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,000
So, what, so, maybe I should just no longer do a show

1690
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,840
on myself.

1691
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,680
You can be very funny.

1692
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,800
If I don't, if I'm not by myself,

1693
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,560
if I have someone else, I'm always looking

1694
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,160
to do when you have an interview with somebody.

1695
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,920
And you always say, you're, why are not funny?

1696
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,960
You're not trying to be funny.

1697
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,680
Trying to ask someone's fucking questions

1698
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,920
and get some answers.

1699
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,760
Still, you know, just in between put some funny things,

1700
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,960
you're so funny.

1701
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,120
What do you, give me an example of where I was not funny?

1702
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,280
Oh, thank you.

1703
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,160
Well, sometimes when I see you doing interviews,

1704
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,560
and I think, when did you see me doing interview recently?

1705
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,400
Thank you.

1706
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Well, it was the last time.

1707
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,640
Did you, that was the last time?

1708
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,360
When I'm being interviewed, or when I'm interviewing.

1709
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,920
No, no, it was a written interview.

1710
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,840
And I thought, God, you're so serious.

1711
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,160
Are you?

1712
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,920
Ah, but I'm being in well.

1713
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,520
Don't get angry now.

1714
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,200
I'm not, I'm crushed.

1715
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,520
Oh.

1716
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,240
No, it's good.

1717
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,080
It's in a compliment.

1718
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,320
Back to the show for a second.

1719
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,320
Fuck all the interview stuff.

1720
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,160
I don't care about that.

1721
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,160
I don't do interviews.

1722
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,440
No, yeah, no, you hate it.

1723
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,840
Yes, I do.

1724
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,840
So, you think my show was boring?

1725
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,200
No, I said, did I say that?

1726
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,240
You said you said no, in fact, you said, you're so boring.

1727
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,440
I mean, you're so serious.

1728
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,440
You said boring.

1729
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,440
God.

1730
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,720
But it's serious stuff that I'm talking about.

1731
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:40,040
It is, we're, who's going to say, I remember even when, when we, in the beginning,

1732
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,600
you said, don't laugh when we have sex.

1733
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,600
Do you remember though?

1734
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,600
No.

1735
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,600
Yeah, you said that.

1736
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,600
I don't like it.

1737
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,600
I don't like it when you're gay.

1738
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,600
Bullshit.

1739
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,600
Bullshit.

1740
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,600
Bullshit.

1741
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Bullshit.

1742
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,600
I did not.

1743
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,600
I remember.

1744
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're confused.

1745
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,640
No.

1746
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,640
No, absolutely, no.

1747
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,640
Why would I say that?

1748
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,640
That's not true.

1749
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,200
No, you have to have to have everything.

1750
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,600
You were giggling last night when I was pounding you.

1751
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,880
Did I say stop doing that?

1752
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,880
Did I say stop?

1753
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,640
Did I say anything?

1754
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,640
No.

1755
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,040
But you can't stop me.

1756
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,040
Right.

1757
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,040
But I think I don't, I don't know about that.

1758
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,680
I, that must be one of your other boys.

1759
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,080
Sometimes it's very serious.

1760
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,080
You know.

1761
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,080
Yeah.

1762
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,080
You know.

1763
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,080
No, no.

1764
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,080
So we're sponsored.

1765
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,440
No, it's not the responsibility.

1766
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,520
It's a, I want the world to continue in harmony.

1767
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,080
Let's laugh more.

1768
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,080
Let's laugh more.

1769
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,080
That's what I'm saying.

1770
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,080
That's what I'm saying.

1771
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,080
I'm more fun.

1772
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,080
Have more fun.

1773
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,080
Next year.

1774
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,080
Send me naked pictures.

1775
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,080
No, no, no, no.

1776
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,080
Because it's not nothing funny about that.

1777
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,080
No, what do you mean?

1778
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,080
It's, how it's a nice porn.

1779
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,080
Can people just email me porn?

1780
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,080
It's not funny.

1781
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,080
It is, well, that's not funny.

1782
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,080
What other people's porn is not funny?

1783
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,080
That's not for funny.

1784
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,080
That's sad.

1785
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,080
That's not for me.

1786
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,080
Oh, okay.

1787
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,080
I mean sad.

1788
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,080
Whatever.

1789
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,080
But let's, let's.

1790
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,080
We didn't know.

1791
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,080
Now porn is sad.

1792
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,080
Simple.

1793
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,080
That's very simple.

1794
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,080
That's all it takes for guys.

1795
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,080
I'm a bit disappointed now.

1796
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,080
Okay.

1797
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,080
There's more in you than that.

1798
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,080
Yeah.

1799
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,080
Yeah.

1800
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,080
I need to, I need someone to bounce off of.

1801
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,080
All my good shows are when someone else is on.

1802
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,080
Yeah.

1803
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,080
Is that so?

1804
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,080
Yeah.

1805
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,080
But, you know, there's no one around to do that.

1806
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,080
Yeah.

1807
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:33,080
Because don't I always say you're not a likable person?

1808
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,080
Why yes, dear.

1809
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,080
You said that many times.

1810
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,080
Yeah.

1811
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,080
People think that you're an asshole.

1812
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,080
You are not.

1813
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:48,080
You are very lovable, very sweet, good person.

1814
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,080
And people should know.

1815
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,080
I don't care if people think I'm an asshole.

1816
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,080
Well, I do.

1817
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,080
Because not fair.

1818
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,080
Yeah.

1819
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,080
It's all right.

1820
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,080
Those who get to know me will be delighted.

1821
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,080
You're very misunderstood.

1822
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,080
Yeah.

1823
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,080
Okay.

1824
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,080
That's for sure.

1825
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,080
You are.

1826
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,080
Okay.

1827
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,080
Right.

1828
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,080
So let's change that.

1829
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,080
Next one.

1830
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,080
Change one.

1831
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,080
Everything different.

1832
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,080
New chances.

1833
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,080
Right.

1834
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,080
Okay.

1835
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,080
Okay.

1836
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,080
I'm crushed.
