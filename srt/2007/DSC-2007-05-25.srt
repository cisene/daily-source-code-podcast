00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
Well, Adam, with the addition of John C. Devorek to Pod Show, I am assuming that the DSC will

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,000
get a little extra techie. So, you know, the man that gets no spam, the man from devorek.org

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,440
slash blog, why had that techiness to Fubar Friday and will that work? Exactly what will

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,160
that mean? Because with all the music, you're going to go techno pop, or you're going to

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,200
go synthesizers. I guess we'll find out in the DSC 608, but welcome aboard, John C. Devorek,

Guilford

182
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,180
On the west side of G-town

183
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,180
At least in the manner

184
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,180
Windows are open

185
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,180
It's definitely going to rain a little bit

186
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,180
This afternoon in the general London area

187
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,180
But I'd kind of tell you this global warming

188
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,180
It's you may think it's bad

189
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,180
But before you know it

190
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,180
The United Kingdom will be the new Bahamas

191
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,180
Here I'd like to make a motion

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,180
To rock this mother out

193
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,180
You're on her

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,180
Please don't bang that gavel

195
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,180
You can try this cowbell out

196
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,180
Let's all give a nod

197
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,180
To the hardest work in law here

198
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,180
It's just a tiny bag

199
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,180
It's just a tiny bag

200
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,180

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
You're on her

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,180
What do you say?

204
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,180
You might even end when this case

205
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,180
You're a zeta

206
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,180
You're a zeta

Thank you, man

289
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,180
Hey, now I really picked a fine week to quit smoking

290
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,180
Particularly with all the humidity in the air

291
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,180
I have night sweats have come back again

292
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,180
And I don't know if it's a

293
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,180
It has to be some part of physical thing

294
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,180
That's taking place, just my body saying

295
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,180
I don't want to make a meme

296
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,180
And just the general fact of it being warm and muggy

297
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,180
Water water helps could give me night sweats

298
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,180
John DeBorick with potchot

And the other day, Drew and I got to interview world famous

303
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,180
Reggae legend Ziggy Marley

304
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,180
And he told us some secrets

305
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,180
If you don't believe me, you should check this out

306
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,180
Yeah, I mean, I think this is for a seminar

307
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,180
I told anybody that

308
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,180
Exclusives

309
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,180

Head over to Dawn and Drew.com and June 1st

312
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,180
I got to tell you guys totally rock that you got that all set up

313
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,180
Seriously

314
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,180
And I believe this is going to be a tune on the podcast music network

315
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,180
I mean, does it get any better than that

316
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,180
All right, here's something that will be on the PMN tune

317
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,180
It's from 1995 and it's being kind of upgraded remix

318
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,180
Then you probably heard of Jimmy Z

319
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,180
But I'm not going to tell you who plays

320
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,180
Lick guitar, bass, slide, B3 organ and Roads of piano

321
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,180
But you know who he is basically

322
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,180
Think about it

323
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,180
I'm telling you who it is at the end

324
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,180
I know you know him

325
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,180
This is the house for the love

326
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,180
But I'm so bad right now

327
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,180
Yeah, I'm going to cross the wind

328
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,180
And I'm on the moon

329
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,180
You've been sweet on the moon

330
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,180
I'm going to end it more

331
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,180
I'll tell you know the visitation

332
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,180
No time to worry

333
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,180
There's the blame no one can see

334
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,180
Yeah, I never think you'd think

335
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,180
Yeah, but there's a deal

336
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,180
Yeah, but there's a deal

337
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:43,180
Yeah, I'm going to cross the wind

338
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,180
No one there the whole

339
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,180
The rain we chose to go

340
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,180
Water's turning away

341
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,180
We've stopped by a lot of memory

342
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,180
They got me and they're with us

343
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,180
We're going down the semblance

344
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,180
And all that I don't know

345
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:32,180
She says all the love that was in me

346
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Tell me if I'm a stone

347
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,180
I can't have a place to live

348
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,180
I can't have a place to go

349
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:51,180
And I'm going to cross the wind

350
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,180
No one there

351
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:18,180
Yeah, I never think you'd think

352
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:28,180
Yeah, but there's a deal

353
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,180
No one can see

354
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,180
Yeah, but there's a deal

355
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,180
No one there the whole

356
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,180
The rain we chose to go

357
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:49,180
The rain we chose to go

358
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,180
This is all gone

359
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:03,180
Bye-bye

360
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:33,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

361
00:20:33,180 --> 00:21:03,180
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no anymore, no people no μα o'ypen, no para

362
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:17,180
Đây.

363
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:26,820
It's so cool.

364
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:35,420
So man, you can't hide it

365
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:08,700
I think I actually have heard the song, but indeed it was like 17 years ago when it was

366
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,700
first of the quarter.

367
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:16,900
I don't believe ever released either, so that would be cool to have it on the network.

368
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:24,460
The project's titled, Savala Bloom, Jimmy Z, studio tapes from 1995, transferred into

369
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:31,820
Logic Pro at the Bloom Residence, Ron Bloom indeed, partner in CEO of Potio, played

370
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:37,420
lead guitar based, slide, V3 organ, Willow's Appiano, Jimmy Z, they're on Harp and Vocals

371
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,060
and of course the fabulous Blue Zets on Back and Vocals and Studio Legend, David Raven

372
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:47,060
on Drums, hopefully to be released soon for all podcasters to play.

373
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,900
Bloom, it's your own dog food!

374
00:22:48,900 --> 00:23:10,540
I had him, Mike the B here, thanks for the shoutout for in-working hammer on DSC599.

375
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:17,020
I just loved the fight flight cast, it sounded like a model flight to me, you do a great job

376
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,580
with that radio, particularly with those continental accents coming through.

377
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,740
I'm sure the flight scores will be used in the podcast in their training.

378
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,340
I found it demanding enough to keep up with all the info I had to get in gift to the

379
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,300
AT controllers around South East England, given that Heathrow, Gattwick and Farm were split

380
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,380
the airspace into funnels, vertically and horizontally, no spot is outside intense radio

381
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,380
control.

382
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,380
I just have to say, well done, fold up.

383
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:52,700
Adam, it's got her hands, it's on to the DSC on Tuesday, May 20, 2021, you're on your flight

384
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,460
night, have to say that I'm interested in knowing how to fly as to the London Aircraft

385
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,500
and I'm wondering if you have any tips for somebody who is interested in doing so, how much

386
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,060
time and money it's going to take to get that license, so if you can help me up, that'd be

387
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
great.

388
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,620
If you don't want to play this comment on the air, you can email me, it's Jack.

389
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,780
Hey, Adam, it's Chris over at PlainMan.com and the PlainMan is podcasts and like I promised,

390
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,420
I've got another five second flight lesson for the week for you.

391
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,780
All right, so here's the deal, you're trying to call your traffic control, but nobody's

392
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,340
responding and you try again and again and again and they're still not responding.

393
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,540
You know what you do?

394
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,420
You get off the couch, you get down the airport, you get in the air plane, you go fly

395
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,420
and man, it's just been way too long.

396
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,020
All right, another one for the week, we'll see you next time.

397
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,980
Dude, I love that, the five second flying lesson or flight lesson, that's great.

398
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,340
You should do a podcast of all of that.

399
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,780
And of course, continue to send them on over to, to this particular part.

400
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,780
I'm about one more mashup on.

401
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,780
I'm gonna have to stop singing this one since I heard it.

402
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,780
I'm not gonna push you, this is the last part.

403
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,380
There's no squeeze, but there's motion, I got it.

404
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,900
I'm gonna break the pictures.

405
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,500
You're gonna break well, it's still in my room.

406
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
I'm gonna pop that.

407
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,100
I miss you too much, but I got mine.

408
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,740
I'm gonna break, quit playing the UK, and you can't shine.

409
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,820
Oh, then it's just a week, I'm gonna try again and again and again and again and again.

410
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:43,980
There's never too much noise, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

411
00:25:43,980 --> 00:26:13,980
I'm gonna break, quit playing the UK, and you can't shine, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

412
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:43,980
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no this is a sentence, i think to touch something I may believe somewhere, so it won't be, so it won't be, so, who,'ll be! so, hope it won't be, so it won't be! and I think that I

413
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,980
It's so hard it's going at it

414
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,980
It's making it even the heart

415
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,980
I'll fight it

416
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,980
I'm dirty dirty

417
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,980
I'm the saddest

418
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,980
I'm losing you

419
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,980
I'm losing you

420
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
You're too much

421
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,980
Come on, it's black and I

422
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,980
I'm not gonna let you

423
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,980
Come on, it's black and I

424
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,980
I'm not gonna let you

425
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

426
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

427
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

428
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

429
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

430
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

431
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

432
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,680
Come on, it's black and I

433
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,980
I'm not gonna let you

434
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

435
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

436
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

437
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,980
It's black and I'm not gonna let you

438
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

439
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

440
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

441
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

442
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,980
Come on, it's black and I'm not gonna let you

443
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:58,560
Yeah, you know where it came from, the National Town.com, don't prove it, it's fitting, it's

444
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
fitting.

445
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,700
That's what you get with you, we cross the guys with cheese with 50 cent.

446
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,740
I don't like most of those 50 cent matchups with this one really did it for you.

447
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,740
Yeah.

448
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,980
On Germany, host of tips on the top floor and a proud member of the Potio family, and

449
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,420
I hear you talk a lot about Darmstadt recently, so it sounds very interesting to me and

450
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,420
I'm really looking forward to all the news that you're going to bring home around that.

451
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,700
I'm also an active potcaster in Germany for the German market, so we might want to talk

452
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,260
about a few things here.

453
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:34,540
I've also just released my show number 200 of tips on the top floor, if you want to see

454
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:39,900
the trucker Tom as an alien, Don and Drew Dancing, CC Japanese singing, and of course

455
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,400
the Jeff Smith, who wrote the theme song for the show, then yeah, going over to tips

456
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,740
from the top floor.com, lots of photography tips in that show as well, and by the way, I'm

457
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,780
not even going to go into what Darmstadt actually translates to.

458
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:01,460
Yeah, I know what it does with you, but I know, oh, all the hooter, and of course I'm going

459
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,460
to come and hang out with you.

460
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,460
You know that.

461
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,300
I just needed to get, to get things started in intestine town, because I think that's what

462
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,300
it means, right?

463
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:17,220
Darm is intestine, and stuff is sitting, so intestine city, intestine town, here's

464
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,220
going from California.

465
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:24,220
Her name is Curious, this is Goodbye.

466
00:29:47,220 --> 00:30:02,220
You're mine, so I curse that door on your way out, hang out through it tonight.

467
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:15,220
When you said, look in the fight, teaching me for forever, when you said, look in the fight,

468
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:32,220
you know you remember me forever, you said, you don't tear my heart, but look at me now,

469
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:45,180
I am really dying here, all I want is to disappear, don't make me feel like I'm

470
00:30:45,180 --> 00:31:05,180
going to get wasted in my time, just get me to lie, when you said, look in the fight,

471
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:23,180
teaching me for forever, when you said, look in the fight, when you remember me forever, no matter what

472
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:39,180
I want to be scared, no matter what you feel like, I want to be a angel, now I'm going to be

473
00:31:39,180 --> 00:32:08,180
alone, remember my broken dreams, say, look in the morning, just get me to lie, just get me to lie,

474
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:33,180
when you said, look in the fight, teaching me for forever, when you said, look in the fight, when you remember me forever, no matter what you feel like,

475
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:50,180
anymore, no matter what you feel like, you know you remember me forever, no matter what you feel like,

476
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:59,180
Hey Adam, this is Dawn Miscelli, your special, special secret girlfriend over here at the

477
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,740
Dawn and Drew Show.

478
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,060
And I heard you talking about Tylenol PM and how their sponsor of the show, and I just

479
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,260
wanted to let you know how much I love Tylenol PM.

480
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,300
I've suffered with insomnia for years since I was actually really little, and doctors have

481
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,940
prescribed all sorts of stuff, and most of it actually hasn't worked.

482
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,900
It hasn't helped me get to sleep.

483
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,660
But all in all, Tylenol PM always has helped me fall asleep, and the next day I'm not

484
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,660
Dragon Major asked.

485
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:30,340
So I just wanted to let you know how I felt about it, and I just wanted to also tell you I miss

486
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,340
you.

487
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,340
Bye.

488
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,860
Ah, Dawn, that's so sweet of you, girl.

489
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:40,420
By the way, you do know that Tylenol PM of course works great, but I've got something

490
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,540
that could really put you to sleep, baby.

491
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:54,460
The band was formed in 1975 in New Orleans, Louisiana, previous members, saw my friends.

492
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:00,740
This power trio still, till this day, has all three original members.

493
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:06,460
The first album went gold and became the fastest selling debut album in the history of

494
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,700
Atlantic records.

495
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:15,140
During the next couple of years, they played open-source for Erils Smith, Journey, Zezee

496
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:22,820
Top, Leverboy, T-Trick, Saming Hagar, and R-E-L-Speed Lagen.

497
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:29,660
The group has produced five albums, and five videos with combined sales of almost 2 million.

498
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,660
They have a brand new DVD out, right now.

499
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:39,580
Brent Bradley, a pod show radio sits down with a lead vocalist and guitarist for the rock

500
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,580

00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,620
time, someone will be running with you.

505
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,980
In Spittling the street, Lincoln, England, in Knoxville, Tennessee.

506
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,260
And Scotland joined a global community of runners and participate in this free non-commercial

507
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:30,380
worldwide event that celebrates the joy of running with the challenge of a road race.

00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,020
Think global, run, local.

513
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:01,340
I wanted to remind you all that you've probably heard the suckless campaign is kicked off

514
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,540
now across the network.

515
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,420
If you're listening to Daily Source Code right now, please, I really would like you to

516
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:13,020
particularly if you are a listener who does not have a podcast that really appreciated

517
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:20,780
if you went over, signed up and filled out the enormous length of questions in our surf.

518
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,580
We tried to make some of them entertaining, but at the end of the day it's just really

519
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:28,340
difficult to make basic demographic questions easy.

520
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:32,140
I guess that's why we're giving the opportunity to get free stuff for going through

521
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:37,340
some of these painful exercises, but you actually really do help us suck less.

522
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:45,020
Now, just to put it all into context, we understand, I'd say 99% of the complaints about

523
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,260
the site.

524
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:51,220
We understand about many of these little issues that thousands of people have emailed us

525
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,540
about, but if you really go through the structure of all of these questions, you give us a lot

526
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,940
more information about even how we can make programming better.

527
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,140
And this information is also going to all podcasts, who are participating on the network.

528
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,580
So it's not just for podcasts, it's for your favorite podcast.

529
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,980
Please go to suckless.podshow.com.

530
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,380
All right, yeah, it's time for something a little different.

531
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,620
You know, sometimes I'm so far away from your dolly.

532
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:26,900
I'm not safe, he like me to why I read and it's time for you.

533
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:32,100
That's what I want you to do while I'm going to go.

534
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,900
Tell me.

535
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,700
You want to take my love with you.

536
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:48,260
Everywhere you go, I want to take my love baby.

537
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:55,380
Everywhere you go, don't take my love baby.

538
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:05,380
Everywhere you go, in a street and a cross, when you're home, all alone.

539
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:12,500
You want to take my love with you, everywhere you go.

540
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:19,780
When I'm gone, so far away, in your heart, I want to stay.

541
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,980
So babe, keep your mind on me and will I love it.

542
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:30,340
And it's me who I don't have tension, can't turn around.

543
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,940
But you know how I'll always be around.

544
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:40,260
You're just gonna take my love with you, everywhere you go.

545
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,380
Come on baby, take my love with you.

546
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:52,580
Everywhere you go, don't take my love with you.

547
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,460
Everywhere you go, everywhere you just stay.

548
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:10,100
Everywhere you go, in a street and a cross, when you're home, all alone.

549
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:16,580
You've got to take my love with you, everywhere you go.

550
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:36,260
Everywhere you go, in a street and a cross, when you're home, all alone.

551
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:44,100
You've got to take my love with you, everywhere you go, in a street and a cross, when you're home.

552
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:50,900
You've got to take my love with you, everywhere you go.

553
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:56,900
You know you're just not to my love with you

554
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,900
Everywhere you go

555
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Wow, you want to take my love baby

556
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,900
Everywhere you go

557
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,900
Oh baby, take my love with you

558
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,900
Everywhere you go

559
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,900
You know you need to stop and take my love baby

560
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,900
Everywhere you go

561
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,900
In the street

562
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,900
And I'm proud

563
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,900
You know when you're home

564
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,900
When you're all alone

565
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,900
All the highways

566
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,900
All the pathways

567
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,900
You know it sounds like you went back to

568
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,900
I don't know was it's 60s

569
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,900
Maybe even earlier than that

570
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,900
But no nothing like that

571
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,900
A street-y paper boy read

572
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
And the true loves

573
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,900
From Massachusetts and the United States

574
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,900
Actually from Boston

575
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
And it's on the podcast music network

576
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,900
Am I just fooling myself and take my love with you

577
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,900
Two tracks that you definitely need to check out

578
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,900
And what we need to check out now

579
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,900
What's playin' on

580
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
Ados first

581
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
Tonight

582
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,900
This of course is the complete plot-lock segment of

583
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
The Daily Source code

584
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Particularly when it's a maximum music football pride

585
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,900
We gear up my first generation iPod

586
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,900
Probably gonna have my six or seventh gen iPod

587
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,900
When it comes in the iPhone

588
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,900
Even if it has only 45 minutes of battery life

589
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,900
I'll be interested in it together

590
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,900
It's just the kind of the thick one

591
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
It didn't have all that space on it

592
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,900
But it's just the one that I did develop

593
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,900
The actual iPod or application on

594
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
So there's a lot of shit on this

595
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,900
From years and years of finding stuff

596
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
On Napster

597
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,900
Back in it was illegal stuff

598
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,900
That I've bought through iTunes

599
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,900
And actually Napster Rhapsody

600
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,900
And I have a special Friday playlists

601
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,900
Which I had collected over the years

602
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,900
And I'm gonna just...

603
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,900
Hold on a second, we put it on

604
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,900
Random here

605
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,900
Because you...

606
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,900
You know, you've got a...

607
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,900
When I hear it, hold on a second

608
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,900
Okay, maybe this will work

609
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,900
Yeah, there it goes

610
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,900
Ah!

611
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,900
Oh, I know what this one is

612
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,900
Remember these vibes?

613
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,900
Was it Clark Daxler?

614
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,900
This was huge

615
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,900
Even in Russia

616
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,900
All right

617
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,900
From the first gen iPod

618
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,900
Shattered dreams

619
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,900
So much for your promises

620
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,900
They know that they'll let me go

621
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,900
Cut up in web of lights

622
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,900
But it was just too late to know

623
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,900
I thought it was you

624
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,900
Through a step on the sky

625
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,900
And now you're giving me

626
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,900
Nothing but shadow dreams

627
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,900
And shadow dreams

628
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,900
Feel like I've got a way

629
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,900
Don't wait

630
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,900
From there's a fever

631
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,900
You said you'd die for me

632
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,900
I'll look up to reality

633
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,900
I'm found a future not so bad

634
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,900
I dreamt the impossible

635
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,900
But maybe things could work out

636
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,900
Right

637
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,900
I thought it was you

638
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,900
Through a step on the sky

639
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,900
And now you're giving me

640
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,900
Give me nothing but shadow dreams

641
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,900
Shattered dreams

642
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,900
Feel like I've got a way

643
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,900
Don't wait

644
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,900
From there's a fever

645
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,900
You'll give me nothing but shadow dreams

646
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,900
And shadow dreams

647
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,900
Feel like I've got a way

648
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,900
Don't wait

649
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,900
From there's a fever

650
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,900
You said you'd die for me

651
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,900
I thought it was you

652
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,900
Through a step on the sky

653
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,900
And now you're giving me

654
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,900
Give me nothing but shadow dreams

655
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,900
I thought it was you

656
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,900
Through a step on the sky

657
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,900
And now you're giving me

658
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,900
Give me nothing but shadow dreams

659
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,900
Feel like I've got a way

660
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,900
Don't wait

661
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,900
From there's a fever

662
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:41,900
You're giving me nothing but shadow dreams

663
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,900
Feel like I've got a way

664
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,900
Don't wait

665
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,900
From there's a fever

666
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,900
And it was in 1988

667
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,900
So I went to Russia

668
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,900
And this is way before the wall came down

669
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,900
With a Moscow music piece festival

670
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,900
And it was basically

671
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,900
And I was behind the iron curtain

672
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,900
So the western music band

673
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,900
It was all underground

674
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,900
The kids knew about Aussie

675
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,900
They knew about the scorpions

676
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,900
And stuff like that

677
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,900
Because Germany

678
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,900
Relatively close proximity

679
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,900
But an Aussie of course

680
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,900
But there was no radio playing

681
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,900
The stuff people had cassettes

682
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,900
And I remember going into a restaurant

683
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,900
That I think kind of half restaurant bar

684
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,900
Type thing very small

685
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,900
Actually one of the nicest restaurants in Moscow at the time

686
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,900
Because we were with some officials

687
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,900
I can't recall who

688
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,900
It was a long time ago

689
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,900
And it was just

690
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,900
There was a band in the corner

691
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,900
And they were playing

692
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,900
Singing kind of

693
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,900
It sounded like traditional Russian stuff

694
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,900
And then all of a sudden they started

695
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
Into shattered dreams

696
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,900
And the girl had clearly

697
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
She had no printed lyrics

698
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,900
So it was kind of phonetic

699
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,900
So the lyrics were all off

700
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,900
But her heart was in the right place

701
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,900
It was really a fantastic experience

702
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,900
Oh, so I can see what we got going here

703
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,900
What day is it today?

704
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,900
It's Friday

705
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,900
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday

706
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,900
Food on Friday

707
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,900
Adam Spine of Thunderfome

708
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,900
Yeah

709
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:12,900
Oh well

710
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,900
I'll tell you

711
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,900
As you know

712
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,900
I've had Germany on my mind for the past week

713
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,900
And having grown up in Amsterdam

714
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,900
If you know a little bit of history

715
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,900
The Netherlands

716
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,900
See the Nazis in the Second World War

717
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,900
Basically

718
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:31,900
You know

719
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,900
Drove right through the Netherlands

720
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,900
Who capitulated within two or three days

721
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,900
And they bombed

722
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,900
The shit out of the country

723
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,900
Rotterdam especially

724
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,900
And we are growing up in the post World War Two era

725
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,900
In the Netherlands

726
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,900
There was always kind of an animosity towards the Germans

727
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,900
And of course we're really talking about 20, 25 years ago

728
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,900
Maybe even longer

729
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:56,900
I can kind of feel this

730
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,900
And it just wasn't a good vibe

731
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,900
Now it's still been a relatively short time

732
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,900
Only you know one human lifetime

733
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,900
Since the Second World War ended

734
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,900
60, 60, some odd years

735
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,900
But there is of course a whole new generation

736
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,900
That has grown up

737
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,900
And having been in Germany for the past couple days

738
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,900
And really having had an opportunity to speak with many different citizens

739
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,900
And of course they're all European citizens

740
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,900
But just Germans

741
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:26,900
It's completely different

742
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,900
I have to say

743
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,900
All the people I met

744
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,900
And of course most of these were business discussions

745
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,900
Curdious

746
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,900
Nice

747
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,900
You know

748
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,900
Funny

749
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,900
Just really

750
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,900
Awesome

751
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,900
And I have to say the level of English that the Germans speak

752
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,900
Is really really high

753
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,900
And it's kind of surprising

754
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,900
Because they don't subtitle

755
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,900
Television programs

756
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,900
Well like movies and TV series

757
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,900
They really do overdubs

758
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,900
So there is no way to read along

759
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,900
And hear the words

760
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,900
And kind of learn like countries surrounding Germany do

761
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,900
So I don't know where they get it

762
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,900
I don't know if it's

763
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,900
I don't know

764
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,900
It's just good

765
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,900
It's work and I like it a lot

766
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,900
And so it really kind of

767
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,900
Kick me in the ass once again

768
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,900
You have these preconceived notions about people and nations

769
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,900
And they're based on perhaps old information

770
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,900
Like in my case where it's been many, many, many years ago

771
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,900
And I've got to tell you

772
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,900
I'm very excited about our movement of Germany

773
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,900
And of course now we get to decide

774
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,900
We're going to have our headquarters

775
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,900
Now I tell you where it's not going to be

776
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,900
It could be Hamburg

777
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,900
It could be Cologne

778
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,900
Cologne

779
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,900
It could be Munich

780
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:43,900
It could be

781
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,900
Well

782
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,900
What's your suggestion?

783
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,900
Let me know

784
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,900
Alright everybody

785
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,900
In the United States

786
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:57,900
Have a great memorial day

787
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,900
We kind of everybody in the United Kingdom

788
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,900
Have a great bank holiday

789
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,900
I'm so glad your banks give us so many holidays

790
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,900
And of course I will be doing a show on Monday

791
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,900
No idea where I'm going to be next week

792
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,900
Could be Germany

793
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,900
Could be San Francisco

794
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,900
Could be New York

795
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,900
Could be in your backyard
