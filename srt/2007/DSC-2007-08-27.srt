00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,040
In a world where TV networks, movie studios and record labels still think they can

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,400
govern what you see in here. One man has the power to return control of entertainment

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,400
to the masses and make big media corporations wet their tiny little pants. From Pod Show,

Carrino.

There are Charlie's six, five, six.

9
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,560
It was $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,720
radio content in my ears.

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,720
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

12
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,720
And I'll get on the stairs, close in the middle of the middle of the middle of the

38
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:44,340
It is Delta, Sierra Charlie, episode six, five, six kicking off of the mash up there from

39
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,420
the Hoob Boys, suggested by Anthony Barnes, of course, friends, stuck in chemicals, mash up

40
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,740
with the chemical brother, Steelers, Wheel, Gary, Newman.

41
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:58,740
On this beautiful Monday, August 27th, 2007, the date of our daughters' birth was born

42
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:06,460
in this day, 730 in the evening, in Livingston, New Jersey, in 1990, she turned 17 today.

43
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,620
Oh, my God, where has the time gone?

44
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,100
I was just thinking, you know, episode six, five, six, I'm moving up towards a thousand

45
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,740
episodes, but that's nothing compared to 17 years of childrearing.

46
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,740
Everybody, how you doing?

47
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,340
Beautiful day here in the UK at the manner, on the west side of G-town, we've got just

48
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:31,460
a couple of clouds in the skies, temperature, it's got to be in the 20s, tell you, 22, 23 degrees

49
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,860
sun is just pouring down, it is beautiful.

50
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,860
So you know, by the time I leave for San Francisco on Saturday or Sunday, I think Saturday

51
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,260
probably, otherwise there is going to be even better here and it will be shit in San

52
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,260
Francisco.

53
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,260
That's the way it usually goes.

54
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,980
Ain't that the truth, I just realized I want to play a special song from the soundtrack

55
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,180
to my life for Christina's birthday, we'll get to that.

56
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,060
But a couple of actually at whole ton of comments that came in over the weekend, none of

57
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,180
which I played on the special Sunday, non-food bar edition of the show I did with the

58
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,340
lady Patricia, which I thought turned out pretty good actually, in hindsight listening back

59
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,100
to it at the end, that's pretty funny bits, she's nuts, what a woman, eh, what a woman

60
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,100
I have.

61
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,820
I'm such a lucky bastard.

62
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,180
Lucky bastard that you guys are sending in such beautiful calm.

63
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,620
You know, I really, when I was in the, you know, you have to understand, I was at Roseville

64
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,620
Field Mall.

65
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,180
I was depressed because of the weather and the lack of bandwidth and I'm sitting in the

66
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,580
car and I'm like, you know what that frick, you know, I got no time for the show.

67
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,420
I really want to devote as much time as possible.

68
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,260
And of course, by actually doing it in the car, I kind of went back to my roots and it

69
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,940
was really spurred on by a lot of lovely words from a lot of you guys.

70
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,100
I'm telling like, you know, like 40, 50 different comments, I can't play, I cannot, I don't

71
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,940
want to play any of them really because it's seem so self-serving.

72
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,900
But some people were just so beautiful in the way they put it that I want you to know

73
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:01,020
that you really did motivate me very much in, in just kind of picking myself back up off

74
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,460
my feet at him.

75
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,060
It's Carmen Tyler with the Carmen Gast.

76
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,500
And I have a small beef with you, okay?

77
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:19,100
Really, I'll have to say is no, no, no, no, no, no and no, you know, I'm sure you're

78
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:26,100
a guy who's definitely used to hearing a lot of women say, yes, yes, yes, yes.

79
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,100
Well, you know what?

80
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,780
If you stop doing the DSC, are you going to get as no, no, no and up, no, you can't stop

81
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,780
man.

82
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,780
You got to do the DSC.

83
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,780
You have to.

84
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:45,060
For all the women around the world so that we will continue to say, yes, oh, Carmen, oh, man,

85
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,220
I'm thinking maybe I stop off in Los Angeles on my way out to San Francisco just to say

86
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,540
hello and see if you can say yes, yes, yes.

87
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,780
This is Rodrick from Amsterdam Hollands, a long time the USC listener and former decibel

88
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,780
colleague.

89
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:07,100
I heard you on the DSC 654 about a depressing mood under dark sky and dark thoughts about

90
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,380
quitching the daily source go, although it was just a dark moment in time and nothing more

91
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,380
than that.

92
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,100
I want to tell you how I appreciate your almost daily reports and that you inspired me

93
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,660
going podcasting myself, I like you.

94
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,420
I did a lot of mainstream media and still do, but doing my own thing at a completely

95
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,740
free four main to net station called Kicks Radio in the Netherlands uploading and casting

96
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:39,900
weekly completely free from my home, that is an unbelievable, incredible experience of

97
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,900
freedom.

98
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:47,980
That freedom of ideas of choice, musically a sound is incredible, I love the show, love

99
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:54,300
the possam music from mashuptown.com, Blake Morgan, Ethan Stone and all the others, Adam

100
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:02,300
just continue, keep on doing the great job, folder and red pill are no doubt, nice to hear

101
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:09,420
from Rodrick, man, it's been about 25 years since we were both at the Pirate Radio Station

102
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,580
decibel radio, it's 80, maybe even longer than that, maybe 26, 27 years crap, man, you

103
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,900
still sound good, massive pipes, massive, yeah, you something that I'm real good for me.

104
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,020
And you know, that is why I got into this before the freedom to be able to say whatever

105
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,300
I want to say, to be able to play whatever I want to play, whenever I want to play it,

106
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,860
or almost whatever I want to play, whenever I want to play it.

107
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,820
Hey, Adam Allison from Craftcast, see, listen, I was going to call this message in on Monday

108
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,860
and put it off when you were having such problems out there in Fire Island and I know

109
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,460
the weather sucks, I hear ya, but what you're going to do, it's going to change, I know it's

110
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,900
going to change and it's going to change before you leave, but here's the thing, I started

111
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,100
finally listening, I was excited to see your show up today and I thought, oh my gosh, I can't

112
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,860
wait a second longer to call him and tell him what I want to say, which was, oh my god,

113
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,820
if you stop doing your show, I'd flip out, what I was going to call and tell you on Monday was

114
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,420
how much I just want to say thank you, thank you for putting your creative juices, energies,

115
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:16,060
and endeavors and passion in the way that you do because I get to use all of that and I hear

116
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:22,700
from people and you don't hear from the people I hear from, so I'm telling you, I get to put

117
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,660
a service out to people and they tell me how much they love the service and how I inspire them

118
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,020
and their work and all this great feedback and I couldn't do it without you, so I just want you

119
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:40,300
to know that and yeah, I know the weather will change, life will be better again, I just know it,

120
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,060
hang in there, I think food bar Friday will be especially sunny, okay? Love you, bye.

121
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:54,540
I mean, sexy Alice in there, thank you, darling. You know, probably the biggest bummer for me is

122
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,940
when I can't do a food bar Friday and it's been really rough the past couple of weeks

123
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:05,980
just because of the London commute because so much is going on and you know, particularly Friday,

124
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,060
which does take a lot of production because a lot of sifting through song submissions and I love it

125
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:16,380
when you guys send stuff in listening to stuff on the pod save music network, art to a dub always sends

126
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,700
in tons of mashups, I mean, you know, and when I can't do one of those shows, really, really

127
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,420
bums me out. Anywho, eventually, eventually I'll just be able to do this full time if I'm lucky.

128
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,940
It'll be quite a big end around to be able to do it, but we're going to get there. Hey,

129
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:40,060
toilet drop iPhone update. As you know, over the weekend on Sunday morning, I dropped my iPhone,

130
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,180
actually I figured out I was retracing my steps today and figured out exactly what happened. So I

131
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:52,140
had it in the breast pocket of my alges era bathroom, which is not really an alges era bathroom,

132
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,540
but it has, it's from, I stole it from the Borgella Rob hotel in Dubai, which is the big one that

133
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,100
looks like a sailboat. We stayed for a week on vacation once. I'm sure they charge me for it, of course.

134
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,740
But anyway, I call it my alges era bathroom because it's big and it's really fluffy and has a huge

135
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,340
Arabic like alges era looking symbol on it on the breast pocket. So I split the iPhone in there and I'm

136
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,940
meant, now I know exactly what happened because I have been trained. I have been completely

137
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,900
taught at trained as you can imagine just knowing what my wife is like and living with two women

138
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:29,260
taught at sea down and always particularly after the morning confessional, always a quick, a quick

139
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:35,260
scan with the brush. And that's exactly what I was doing. I leaned forward with the brush,

140
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,940
even though it was, well, I was ready, right, because I hadn't flushed yet. Oh, God.

141
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,220
And that's when I just kind of slipped out. It would have been, you know, my, my, the earbuds

142
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,340
tugged in my ears. It, if the, if the fall hadn't been that far, then maybe the plug would have

143
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,860
stayed in, but alas. It submerged fully for probably about three seconds before I jam my hand down

144
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,460
the throat of the porcelain beast to grab my cupartino creation and pull her back out.

145
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,540
After excessive blow drying, I received several comments on the weblog at curie.com. One of the

146
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,420
ideas was that they step on the anti-intose suggestion of putting it in either a

147
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:20,780
Tupperware box of white rice or kitty litter. We have both. I decided for the latter. And

148
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:29,100
overnight, the phone stayed in its little tomb buried under a white little rocks and lots of dust.

149
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:36,060
Pulled her out this morning, hit the power button and she actually came to life saying,

150
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,300
please plug me in. Because, of course, the battery had drained completely. I'm sure that that was

151
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:47,660
all short circuits that did that. Now, I plugged it back into its charging dock. Not connected

152
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:54,540
to the computer, but to the, the power supply. And sure enough, bit by bit, it came back to life.

153
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,980
I was able to reboot by doing the, the home button and the power button holding it for five seconds

154
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:07,740
consecutively reboots nicely. It, it, it, it brings up my customized wallpaper. It started

155
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:14,540
receiving text messages. In fact, I was able to call the phone and it rang. Identifying correctly

156
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,660
the number. I can see that it has an internet Wi-Fi connection, but I can't, it's completely

157
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:25,020
rendered useless because the touchscreen no longer works. So I can't answer the phone. I actually

158
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,900
did try answering the phone by plugging in the headset and clicking the little microphone.

159
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,780
Which also should answer your calls. It didn't answer that way either. So I presume that

160
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,820
there's still massive short circuits inside. And of course, when you think about the touchscreen,

161
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:47,180
which I believe is pretty much based on moisture for the touch. It's not so surprising that even

162
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,660
just a little bit of moisture is still going to probably mess it up and just make the screen

163
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,100
useless. You, you've probably, if you haven't, I've found you know that if you hold the phone,

164
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,700
you say you want to unlock it, right? You want to open it up or answer it. Call you hold the phone

165
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,860
in your left hand and you have your hand on the screen. No matter what you do, you're not going

166
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,540
to be able to open up. Not going to be able to slide anything. You actually have to hold the phone

167
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,900
in your hand touching the sides and not touching any other portion of the screen. So I presume that

168
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,900
there's still a short circuit. So what I've done is I've, I can't power her down, of course,

169
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,460
unfortunately. That would again require the capability to remove the battery pack.

170
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,380
So it'll just have to run down out of its own accord. But I've varied her once again in the

171
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:37,660
kitty litter and now placed the top of where box on top of the bathroom towel heating rack.

172
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,460
I have high hopes I have to say, it actually just might happen. That would be pretty phenomenal

173
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,740
if it came back to life. I see no reason why it wouldn't, you know, the touch screen

174
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,940
may have fried, but then again, it may not have. You have to expect that there's some type of

175
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:03,500
water that things are going to have to be able to handle. So fingers crossed. In the mean time,

176
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,940
of course, I'm back to the Nokia E61I, which is, you know, it's a perfect phone. It's got,

177
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,540
I do remember the ease of using that keyboard much easier, much faster to type stuff out,

178
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,300
particularly in abbreviated languages, such as when sending a text message or in Dutch or any

179
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:27,820
other funky language, I sometimes write in. That's really nice because, you know, that

180
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,660
is probably the biggest flaw of the iPhone is that it only understands English in its predictive

181
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:39,580
text mode or its auto correction mode and you cannot turn it off, which makes it extremely annoying

182
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:46,460
to do anything in any type of abbreviation form or foreign language. But the whole browsing

183
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:54,460
experience sucks ass. I am completely spoiled by the idea of looking at a full web page tapping

184
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:00,620
to zoom in using the pinch method. I'm addicted to it and, you know, forget about all the other

185
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:06,460
parts of the iPhone, you know, being connected to, you know, or locked into iTunes for your, you know,

186
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:12,060
for your podcast and putting stuff on to it. The phone is a phone is a phone, you know, it does

187
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,540
everything else, my other phone does, it fits all the, yeah, it does everything I want there. But

188
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:24,540
that browsing experience is without a doubt far, far, far superior. In fact, if, if the iPhone

189
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,420
no longer worked and only it was in web browsing mode, I would carry that with me in addition to another

190
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:35,020
phone just to have it as kind of like a web tablet. I have to say, very impressed and I only know

191
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:48,060
that now because you don't know what you got till it's gone. All right, come on in from San Francisco.

192
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:57,900
Hi, I'm prolific program. I hear from San Francisco. It's about 1120 PM on Tuesday, the 21st of August.

193
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:05,660
I just picked up the book you had recommended by Mr. Incean regarding the CIA,

194
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:13,420
legend from the Arizona ashes, or some rubbish like that. It's 700 bloody pages long. You don't

195
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:21,820
accept me to read all that before you interview Uncle Don, do you? Anyway, cheers. It's called Legacy of Ash's

196
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:28,780
subtitle, the history of the CIA by Tim Weiner, who is a reporter for I believe the New York Times.

197
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:37,980
And here's what happened with that book. In 2000, well, 2005, I believe a lot of CIA documents

198
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:44,380
became unclassified and he has poured over those meticulously. By my Uncle Don's own admission,

199
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,420
he says that the book is meticulously researched, seems to be incredibly accurate. And all this

200
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,620
stuff is on the record. There's no off the record stuff. And now, only at like page 250,

201
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,140
or something like that. So I got about a third of the way through the book. I cannot comment on it

202
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:06,860
until I've read the entire thing. But right now, I've already gone through the late 40s, early 50s.

203
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:13,500
I'm now into the mid 60s. Kennedy has already been assassinated. By the way, please, it seems so

204
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,700
obvious what happened with Kennedy when you read this book. He was trying to assassinate all these

205
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:26,300
different leaders through the CIA, through covert operations, including Castro, which, of course,

206
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:31,980
was a huge fiasco. And Castro even said, you know, hey, where's the end with you guys? If you think

207
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,500
that you can just eliminate foreign leaders, you should watch your own back. And well, there you have it.

208
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,140
And then if you see all the ties to Leigh Harvey Oswald, et cetera, that seems pretty damn obvious.

209
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,820
What's going on there? But I can understand how this change my Uncle Don's idea of just doing

210
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,700
it into you. I think he wants to make a much, much bigger statement. So I'm not at all disappointed

211
00:18:52,700 --> 00:19:02,380
as some of you apparently are. Hey Adam, this is Bob Evans in Birmingham. Now, it's so looking forward

212
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:10,140
to that Uncle Don interview. And looks like we've got baited for an upcoming book. Oh, man,

213
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,980
maybe you should give us your phone number or his phone number. So we can call and have the interview.

214
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:22,700
You've got me all anxious about getting the hero that stuff you got to say about Toriyan,

215
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,700
the George Bush is anyway. Just a little disappointed. Love the show, though.

216
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,620
No, don't be disappointed because it's my goal not to disappoint.

217
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,900
I promised that I would read the legacy of the ashes of already read his commentary on it. I want to

218
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,260
give you guys a chance to read the book as well. I must have received 20 different emails

219
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,700
people saying they've ordered the book and are now walking through it. It's not that hard.

220
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:55,980
It's a pretty easy read. I have to say. And there's only so many names in it because these people

221
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,180
have been around for so long or were around for so long. But oh, man, just incredible inside

222
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,620
information into how government's work and in general exactly what I suspected when I went to

223
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:13,580
the Moscow Music Peace Festival in 1988. The wall had not yet fallen. It was very much communist

224
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:22,060
Russia. And we did a live concert from Lenin Stadium in Moscow. I was pretty awesome. That's

225
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,140
a story for a whole other time. I've talked about bits of it before. Excuse me.

226
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:35,740
Bun Jovi, Motley crew, Ozzy Osborn, Skid Row, Gorky Park, Fine Local Russian Band. It was

227
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:42,860
quite a blast. But this was a televised via satellite actually. And I remember quite well looking at

228
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:48,780
the cine video trucks and the westward one radio trucks and we had like in the hotel,

229
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:55,020
you had to reserve your phone call at least 12 hours ahead of time, if not 24. And if the

230
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:01,420
lady said, you know, because in the ladies, one of these like real slavic huge wrestling looking

231
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,300
ladies would come up to your hotel door, knock on it and say something unintelligible. And that meant

232
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,780
that, you know, the phone call was ready. You know, you could make you could place your call.

233
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,500
And if you missed that knock on the door, you had to wait another 12 or 24 hours. So of course,

234
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,300
I just sucked up to the guys. The westward one radio truck. And they had the satellite all set up.

235
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:26,700
They literally had five one six area code dial tone. I could just pick up the phone and just

236
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,700
dial, I'd call Patricia and we were in Jersey at the time. No, we're still in New York.

237
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:37,740
So just picked up. One, two, one, two. Dialed right home. And you know, that was the sophistication

238
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,140
that we were used to. And I remember seeing, you know, so there's, there was this big feed that

239
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:49,180
had to go out of our truck into the Russian telecommunications state run telecommunications truck

240
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,660
before, you know, because that was where all the censorship took place before it actually,

241
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,860
you know, went out up to the satellite. And I remember seeing this, you know, really awesome

242
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:05,900
high tech multi flex type cable running into this, you know, equivalent of a VW van gray.

243
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,380
It's this teeny little thing with curtains drawn. And, you know, something wants to know

244
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,220
all the door would open. You could see this basically the series of tubes sitting in there.

245
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,260
And I thought to myself, these Ruskies, man, they have no sophistication. They've got no technology.

246
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,580
You know, all this worry about, you know, the Cold War and how technologically advanced they

247
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:29,260
were. It's horseshit. And if you read the book, legacy of ashes, ashes, you'll see that it was horseshit.

248
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:37,340
With we completely overestimated the Russians ability and technology for years and hundreds of

249
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:42,780
not thousands of people died in stupid covert actions because of it. Now, the Soviets on the other

250
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:48,140
hand had much better spies. They actually had infiltrated us everywhere, including the Berlin

251
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:55,660
tunnel. If you know any of your history, you'll know what that's about. So my feeling is that there's a

252
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:06,940
story to be told here, which can relate to our present situation with the huge CIA misinformation or disinformation

253
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:13,180
about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, about how the current administration, in particular

254
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:20,940
President George W. Bush views and uses the CIA, which I believe he's doing in a very incorrect manner.

255
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:30,460
And I believe that Uncle Don wants to do one thing that will, if not said a lot of things

256
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:35,660
straight, will definitely give us a roadmap for the way forward, which is part of what legacy of

257
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:41,740
ashes might be trying to do again. I haven't read it all. It does refer once in a while to it, you know,

258
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,380
the lack of intelligence to being exactly like it was in the run up to the invasion of Iraq.

259
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:53,660
And as I was talking Uncle Don, you know, he said, well, you know, he wasn't quite sure. He said,

260
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,340
money doesn't, he doesn't care about money, which of course I said, well, let's go give it away. That's easy.

261
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,020
But I think he really wants to work with a team that will help him. And what I'm going to,

262
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,980
I think what I'm going to suggest is that he works with a producer who will basically record his

263
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,260
awesome story telling. Now, once we've recorded all of his awesome story telling, we can, you know,

264
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,140
cut out any bits that we don't want or, you know, we can at least make a great transcription of

265
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,660
the stuff that he thinks should be in this package, whether it's a book, whether it's an ongoing

266
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:29,740
audio novel. I'm not quite sure what it is. But he needs to get his message out. And I think he needs

267
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,980
to formulate it. I think I need to sit down with him again, which I'm happy to do on the way back

268
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,540
from San Francisco over this current trip. Because I think that there's something really,

269
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,340
really good in there that could possibly change the way that we think about our government.

270
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:49,100
And let's be honest, there's no better time than the present to do that with the 2008 elections

271
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:55,020
coming up. So it is my mission. I shall not. I promise I shall not let you down.

272
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,860
Hi, Adam, this is Solange calling from Belgium. And I just wanted to tell you that I've been

273
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,860
hearing you talking about channels all this time. And honestly, I haven't had a time any time to

274
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:14,940
go look at up and see how it's like. But yesterday, my mom called me and she wanted me to explain

275
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:24,300
to her how to use iTunes. Now, she lives in Boston and we are far away. We can obviously see each other.

276
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:30,220
So it was very complicated to try to explain to her over the phone how to use iTunes.

277
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,900
She's a very intelligent woman, but there was no way that she would understand. And she wanted to

278
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:42,460
listen to old, a radio, mystery channel, something that we really like a lot. All radio,

279
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:49,580
mystery stories. So I went into part show and I created a channel for her. And then I

280
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,300
to send her the link and she clicked on it. And there she had everything she wanted. It was

281
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:02,220
fantastic. Honestly, it was fantastic. It was so easy. And well, what can I say? This is the best

282
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,020
way to bring people into the world of podcasting without making it so complicated for them.

283
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,820
It's automatically downloaded to her iTunes. All she has to do is click and she has them all there.

284
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:19,820
So there we go. So red pill and folder. Bye, Adam. Oh, yeah.

285
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:25,020
Of course, you're a red pill, darling. I could tell. Sim Salabim. It works like magic, doesn't it?

286
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,180
That's right. Go make your own channel at podshow.com. I saw some of the new interface over the weekend.

287
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,660
Now that I finally have enough bandwidth and connect to the VPN at the office. Oh, my god. It's

288
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:43,100
so radically different than anything I've ever seen. But yet it's fun. It's fun to use. It's

289
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:50,140
now we've got a real discovery mechanism that it's just outrageous. It really is. I'm sure a lot of

290
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:55,900
people are going to be confused by the switch. But once you take a look at this thing, oh, man.

291
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,860
I have no idea how we should roll this out. It's so radical. I'm thinking that maybe we

292
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:07,660
we start something along. I don't know. It's a radical change. But man is it awesome. It is.

293
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:14,860
I think what we always, in a way, what we always intended to do. Again, we've had all the underlying

294
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,220
technology and the features in our toolkit, if you will, for, well, ever since we started building

295
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,740
it. In fact, some of those technologies have been brought in, you know, brought forward from

296
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:33,740
development a year and a half to two years ago. Next, excuse me. I still plug Kmart back to

297
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:42,940
school at things. Back to school.podge.com, Kmart.com. You're going to like it. You're certainly

298
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,980
going to like the thinking behind it. Well, see, maybe you'll hate it. I don't know. Anyway,

299
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:55,740
something I normally do with my daughter in the room every year on August 27th. I tell her about

300
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:02,940
the day when her mom said, it's time to get this kid out of me. And, of course, Christina was,

301
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,460
you know, a breach position. So we knew it was going to be a, a sea section. About two weeks

302
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,700
earlier than was scheduled as when Patricia just said, this kid has to come out. It was a

303
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:18,300
beautiful day, not unlike today, I have to say, it was in the high 70s, blue sky. We drove down

304
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:25,020
the sea, Dr. Ladocy at Livingston Hospital, and Livingston New Jersey, Barnabas Hospital, and Livingston,

305
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:31,500
that's where it is. Same Barnabas Hospital. And Lewis said, all right, she's right. This kid has

306
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:37,500
got to come out. And she Patricia went in and first there was an epidural. They sent me out of the room

307
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,860
for that. They wouldn't let me stay. But I was allowed to be there while, and I tell you when

308
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:48,700
when you look at the person you love the most in the world and they open that person up and pull

309
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:55,820
out of that person, a whole new human being, it is just an amazing experience, accentuated by the

310
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:02,380
soundtrack to my life of that moment, because we had the radio on at the time. And I said, you know,

311
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:13,020
why don't you turn on, it was, why was light FM? WLTW106.7 FM. And this was the song that was playing

312
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,780
at the very moment the doctor lifted Christina from Patricia.

313
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:45,260
And some remain, all these places have a moment, with lovers and friends, I still can recall,

314
00:29:45,260 --> 00:30:02,780
some more dead and some more living. My life, I've loved them all. But of all these friends and lovers,

315
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:17,100
there is no one compares with you and these memories are meaning. When I think of them as something

316
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:26,700
you know, I know I'll never lose affection. But people and things and what good went before,

317
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:36,140
I know I love and something about them. In my life, I love you more.

318
00:30:47,100 --> 00:31:06,380
I know I'll never lose affection. But people and things that went before, I know I'll often stop

319
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:29,340
and think about them. I love you more. And that is exactly what the soundtrack to our lives is

320
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,380
all about. Taking you back, bringing those memories forward, the Beatles in my life,

321
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,100
whenever I hear the song. Of course, you can only imagine I can't think about anything else, but that

322
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,260
glory is day. Happy birthday, baby. And congratulations, Mama. Good job.

323
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,980
And the Daily Source Code. So check it out at worldofverning.com.

324
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:56,460
I've been looking to try and find it somewhere on your website. And I was wondering if you might

325
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:03,340
play it one more time so that I can save it. Or if you tell me where I can find it on the

326
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:09,020
potro music.com. Keep up the good work. And we're forward here and turn you. Take care.

327
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,740
All right. Well, that's very interesting because of course I went looking for it. This isn't the

328
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:19,500
days before the Pod Safe Music Network. When I figured that, well, if I at least took a song from a

329
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,540
composer that whose work is in the public domain, I'd be pretty much safe. Of course, it's a remix.

330
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:30,780
So it was created by someone. If you Google rock money off, not rock as the correct

331
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:37,340
for spelling would be RICH, but ROCK, rock money off. This is the Burris remix. Happy to play it

332
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,460
for you. And shutting up so that you can kind of snip it out and use it. Here comes.

333
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:07,820
...

334
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:14,720
Just our own song.

335
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:39,980
Don't believe it!

336
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:48,320
Come on!

337
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:58,320
in a car.

338
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:44,760
There you have it, and it's entirety, at least, all of it that I could find.

339
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,800
The rockmoning off previously the theme tune to the Daily Source code, you can see why it was

340
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
so great.

341
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,800
Oh man, it's really has been a soundtrack to our lives episode.

342
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,640
Hasn't I remember when I did the Daily Source code episode number 200 live on stage at

343
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,200
NomeDex, was that three years ago, two years ago, three years ago, two years ago, at least.

344
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,920
I just remember just potting up the tune and everyone went and he was so recognizable with

345
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,920
the time.

346
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
How am I?

347
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
How times have changed?

348
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,640
There's something that some homework for you to be discussed, hopefully tomorrow, if not Wednesday,

349
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,120
tomorrow is going to be one of those tough days in London, Wednesday, or anything until the

350
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
afternoon.

351
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,400
So, I might be missing tomorrow show, but I do want you to take a look at this for some

352
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,680
homework and article from the IEEE Spectrum.

353
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,600
This is an engineer's geeky site.

354
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,840
A couple of people sent this to me.

355
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,760
The first one was Kenny Man Luke, who sent me this, and I've receded from several other

356
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,360
people since then.

357
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:45,320
It's about the use of compression in music, particularly in the mastering process for CDs,

358
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,640
and I want to tack something on to that about the use of compression on radio stations

359
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,080
and on podcasts such as this one.

360
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,960
It's kind of geeky stuff, but it is something we definitely should discuss because it's

361
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,120
about deprivation of the soundtrack to our lives, so, you know, me, make sure you check

362
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
that out.

363
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,960
Definitely place this link in the show notes today.

364
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Oh, crap.

365
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Hold on.

366
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
Operator Air.

367
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,360
Hi, I was Gary Alexander from the Ultimate Podcast.

368
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
I'm a question for you.

369
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:25,360
I was just listening to ESPN radio to talk radio here in Las Vegas, and the guy, the radio

370
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,360
DJ guy.

371
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,880
I don't even know if you call it DJ, I don't the host, I guess, unless being very

372
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
nice.

373
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
One of these guys.

374
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,880
And he started degrading bloggers and started mentioning that, you know, people bloggers

375
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,240
or guys in their basements that only have four people, four buddies who read their blogs,

376
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,640
and they sit around in their basement, waiting on those four guys who read their posts.

377
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,920
The two, you know, I see, you know, I'm calling it, it kind of made me think, you were

378
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,600
in the radio business for a very long time, and you're very, very familiar with what

379
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,320
guys like that would think.

380
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:08,560
What is your opinion on what may be going through the minds of traditional radio guys,

381
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,280
host, if you will, with this changing new media, with podcasting, and with the way

382
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
that blogging is?

383
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,280
Of course, there are some guys that only have, you know, a couple of friends that read

384
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:27,680
what they have to say, but there are other people out there that have found an audience.

385
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,040
I'm very curious of what do you think, because the guy, obviously, was very defensive.

386
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:39,160
What do you think is the state of mind of these traditional radio hosts and DJs?

387
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
Thanks a lot.

388
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
All right.

389
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
Well, good question.

390
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:48,520
Before the days of packaging and completely tightening up all FM radio formats, which

391
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:55,680
happened after the glorious days of the 60s, disjockeys really were relegated down to the lowest

392
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,760
rung of the show business ladder, and with that, they're only hanging on by their fingernails.

393
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,360
You know, disjockeys used to be very powerful, very influential could really set a mood

394
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,000
for an entire town or city.

395
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,600
People would just, you know, talk about what the DJ said in the morning, and after

396
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:18,440
while it became a place only for stupid comments on the news and rim shots, you know,

397
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,840
after the music became completely packaged.

398
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,880
So this is fear that you're hearing.

399
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,920
These guys, they know that they're hanging on to that lowest show biz ladder, rung by

400
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,960
their fingernails, and they're worried.

401
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,560
They're worried of any, you know, completely afraid of anything that comes into their

402
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,880
into their space that appears on their radar scope.

403
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,880
That's what it is.

404
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,320
That's what it always is when people start slagging on the people off.

405
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,560
It's it's fear, complete and utter fear.

406
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,680
And it's a, it's a lost art, you know, being a DJ.

407
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,640
Some of it comes back, but since we don't have the real live aspect, you know, the real

408
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,360
real live aspect like RF waves going out with a localized station, um, I think the art

409
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,800
is pretty much a loss forever, at least I have no way of influence.

410
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,000
Can any more do I have any, nor do I have any desire?

411
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,680
I get as close as I can by doing this show.

412
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,280
But that's what it is.

413
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
It's just fear.

414
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,680
And anyone you hear talking about bloggers or podcasts or independent producers or media

415
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,920
of that way, hard just consumed by fear.

416
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:27,560
I had a bit of a map from Game's Weasel on this week's show.

417
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,320
We've got a review of BioShock on the 360, Guitar Hero 2, also on the 360.

418
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,600
We have a chat with WWE Superstar Mr Ken Kennedy, one is in London, and you can win a

419
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,320
copy of the new crazy taxi game for the PSP.

420
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,600
Check it out, the gamesweasel.btpodshow.com.

421
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Each man, one way, each horse, one stance, each church, one butter, each master, to his own

422
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
technique.

423
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:57,280
This is okay tomorrow, I see you all, trying to compete with Black Style, or have

424
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:04,800
a like bust a little flying zebra, you're pregnant, not scared, it's very good, but

425
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:13,760
I don't think you can compete with the conscience from style, but you can do it, you can

426
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,760
do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can

427
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,760
do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do

428
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:37,760
it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it,

429
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:53,760
you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it,

430
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:08,760
you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you

431
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:15,760
can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you

I was looking through the top pod plays of the day and I saw this located boner. I'm like, I know those guys

436
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,720
This is the big bad China man. They've got a ton of tracks up on the pod tape music and that

437
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:16,440
worked in the show. No, it's a deadly source code.com. So you can find all of that. Before I forget

438
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,960
the new episode of, was it third episode of season two of port city PD is out. Oh, man. This

439
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:28,360

441
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,640
somehow it's got a really, I don't know what it is. They've got a real dirty, grimy street scene

442
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:44,280
kind of feel to it. I think those guys are doing awesome. If you haven't seen it yet, port city PD.podshow.com,
