1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,720
The $60 million worth of airplane strapped my ass, then the next generation radio content

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,720
in my ears.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,960
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,440
On Jestig, it's Adam Curry.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,800
In a world where TV networks, movie studios and record labels still think they can govern

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,480
what you see in here.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,560
One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses and make big

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,920
media corporations wet their tiny little pants.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,560
From Pod Show, home of the world's most dangerous new content comes the daily source code

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,240
with Adam Curry.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,880
Delta, share it Charlie, five, nine or one.

12
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,240
Me from reality.

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,240
I'm losing ground and I'm feeling fast.

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,240
I see the sound of a trouble fast.

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,240
I never wanted this to be.

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,240
But no this isn't right.

17
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:50,240
But this isn't right.

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:02:02,240
This song, and here those screams ain't just a film, I take your hand, you seem to understand

19
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:12,240
I wish I knew what I was running into, I felt so fast.

20
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,240
I know this wouldn't last though.

21
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,240
I'm losing ground and I'm feeling fast.

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,240
I see the sound of a trouble fast.

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,240
I never wanted this to be.

24
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,240
But no this isn't right.

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,240
But this isn't right.

26
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:13,240
I'm losing ground and I'm feeling fast.

27
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,240
I see the sound of a trouble fast.

28
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,240
I never wanted this to be.

29
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I know this isn't right.

30
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,240
But this isn't right.

31
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:42,240
But this isn't right for me.

32
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:52,240
This isn't right for me.

33
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Come and round, I need a better life.

34
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
This is the life for me.

35
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
It's completely pot safe.

36
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,240
And what that means, well, hopefully we'll be exploring that in today's show.

37
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,240
It is daily source code episode 591 coming to you from the curry manner in the

38
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,240
affluent suburb of Suri known as Gulford west side of the G-town be represented.

39
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,240
It's good to be back home.

40
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Man, let me tell ya.

41
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
It's good.

42
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
It's really, really good.

43
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,240
I didn't sleep a wink on the plane back from San Francisco.

44
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
I don't know what it was.

45
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Actually, I do know what it was.

46
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,240
It was a combination of just as not being tired.

47
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,240
And the fact that it still was despite the the subvant recording schedule which took place

48
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,240
a little bit earlier in the evening than the normal.

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
I just didn't get to bed on time.

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
What can I say?

51
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,240
By the time that the flight arrived was only like an hour after I normally would have gone

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
gone to bed.

53
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
So it just didn't work.

54
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,240
And some weird people on the plane just exuding a weird vibe.

55
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Oh, one of them being Joan Rivers, well known in the United States and in the United

56
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Kingdom, of course.

57
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,240
In fact, I think she furthered her career for many years in Britain before taking over

58
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
tonight's show a couple times for Johnny Carson.

59
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Then she became a huge household name in the States.

60
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,240
I've actually been on a couple of her talk shows in the in the MTV era, in the MTV

61
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
days.

62
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,240
And so she was she was kind of it was weird because she was city.

63
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,240
I wasn't like a 10k.

64
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
My seat is usually 12k or 11k or 10k.

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,240
I like to be on the right hand side right across from the massage center in the

66
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,240
Virginia upper class, which is so that means I'm not looking at other people.

67
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Other people aren't looking at me.

68
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,240
The only person I can be looking at is the person who's actually getting a treatment.

69
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
Which is nice because I can observe them.

70
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,240
And so this is like a little island.

71
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
And when we were aborting the plane and I was on pretty early and I was chill and

72
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
reading a book.

73
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,240
Joan Rivers is just circling around.

74
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,240
You know, like she was almost like on a confessional just walking.

75
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,240
And at first I was like, who's that man?

76
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,240
That's that someone is having some problems walking.

77
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Oh, it's because she's old.

78
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Oh, my God.

79
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
It's Joan Rivers.

80
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
And the face was just amazing.

81
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,240
And I couldn't help but stay.

82
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,240
And I was kind of like peering over my glasses pretending to read my book.

83
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Now I've been on her show.

84
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
So I think she recognized me.

85
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
She didn't say anything.

86
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,240
And it wasn't that moment where I could say, hey, Joan.

87
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,240
But boy, oh boy, pretty frightening.

88
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
And love the woman to death.

89
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
She's in her 70s.

90
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
I'm not quite sure how old she is.

91
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,240
But the face lift is just an amazing piece of work.

92
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
And she got a massage later.

93
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
And I could see the girl.

94
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Massaging her very softly is nothing.

95
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Like, you know how my grandmother when she was.

96
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,240
She passed away when she was 98 years old.

97
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Unbelievable.

98
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Lifetime.

99
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
And my grandfather as well.

100
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,240
Both of them passed very shortly.

101
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Very closely each other.

102
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
And but, you know, I remember my grandmother's back in her 90s.

103
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
And it looked just like Joan Rivers back.

104
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
It was, it was just surprising.

105
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
You know, we're all going to get old.

106
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
And we're all going to look fucked up into crap.

107
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
But it'll be the first one, of course.

108
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
But, um, man.

109
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,240
It was just nothing like the representation on television.

110
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,240
I hadn't seen her in person in a long, long time.

111
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Anyway.

112
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
So, no sleep.

113
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
No rest for the week.

114
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
I did chill a little bit on the.

115
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,240
It was so beautiful when I came home.

116
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
It was just spectacular weather.

117
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Very much like what I left in San Francisco.

118
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
Only not as hot, which is nice.

119
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,240
And today is another beautiful day.

120
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,240
I've been looking at it that since I don't have to do, um,

121
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
serious stuff in the morning on a time basis.

122
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,240
I've actually gotten some life back this week.

123
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
I'm going to do some flying in the mornings.

124
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
I'm, uh, right after I dropped Christina off at school.

125
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
I'm going to go over to, uh, to the airfield.

126
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
I'm going to grab the Delta Sierra.

127
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
And I'm just going to, you know, do a couple of circuits.

128
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Maybe I'll go down a goodwood.

129
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,240
I just need to fly and I need to fly by myself and the weather is so perfect for it.

130
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
So, and I'll do us.

131
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
I'm sure, uh, let me get through tomorrow first.

132
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Because, you know, it's always little, uh, tense, you know, uh, intense,

133
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,240
uh, flying again after a couple of weeks and, and flying with myself.

134
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,240
And so let me just get my chops back and make sure everything's okay.

135
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
And then I'll record a show.

136
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Well, uh, either flying a goodwood or doing some touching goes and, uh,

137
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
we'll, we'll see if I can multitask.

138
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
I'm stretch it at our night.

139
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Hey, today will be a savant-free Monday.

140
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,240
Um, reason for it is, of course, uh, uh, just didn't really have time to come up with a topic.

141
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Think of a, uh, a savant to approach.

142
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,240
So, today we will be talking about something which warns, uh, the help of many a savant.

143
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Some of whom I may know, but you may know some and, uh, we might even have to get some government officials involved.

144
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,240
It's going to be, uh, yeah, it's going to be quite a big conversation.

145
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
But the savants, it's definitely something that's catching on.

146
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:59,240
I met a man when I was traveling and we saw him tonight.

147
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Talking about nothing and everything till we saw the sunlight.

148
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,240
It only takes one minute to say hello, then you're on your way.

149
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,240
It's not you, then who?

150
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,240
If not now, then who?

151
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,240
If not anyone who's gonna be a friend.

152
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Hey, Adam is Jason Jarrett.

153
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,240
I'm just listening to the DSC on 590.

154
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Make the show just going from strength to strength.

155
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
It's a great show.

156
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Have a great week.

157
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Cheers, Mike.

158
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Yeah, Jason.

159
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Thank you so much.

160
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
Yeah, a lot of good response to the food bar Friday.

161
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,240
So, uh, maybe we'll, uh, you know, I want to be careful not to get set in any certain format.

162
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,240
It's, uh, it's dangerous, but I'd say nine out of ten people really love the savant segment.

163
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
So, uh, I want to do more of that.

164
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Maybe I'll incorporate it more into, you know, in a flow and not have something at the set time in the show.

165
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,240
I do want to get more people on the show and I love talking to people, uh, live.

166
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,240
I love doing it unedited, trying to keep it short, trying to move the conversation along,

167
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
keep it relevant.

168
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
It's difficult.

169
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
I have to be honest.

170
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,240
It's, it's not easy to do, uh, but I'm enjoying it immensely.

171
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,240
And the amount of people who are, um, uh, sending me emails and saying, look, I can be

172
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
the savant of this or the savant of that.

173
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
And check this one out.

174
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,240
If somebody's, Sultan of savants, I humbly come before you to offer my services as an energy

175
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
savant.

176
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,240
As atomic rod atoms, I have worked hard to refine my craft.

177
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,240
And I'd like to share my art with DSC listeners.

178
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,240
I run a tiny company that is developing the ability to build emission-free,

179
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,240
atomic engines safe enough and clean enough to be surrounded by people.

180
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,240
We want to put them in a basement, so large buildings, install them on commercial ships,

181
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,240
supply them to developing nations, and even build them in the backyards of certain

182
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,240
affluent people.

183
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,240
As you might imagine, I spent a lot of time trying to understand the competition,

184
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,240
and the obstacles that are innovative company will face as we expand.

185
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,240
I'm sure that a man, as worldly as you, can come up with dozens of interest in questions.

186
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,240
You might be surprised and possibly entertained by the answers.

187
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,240
I know it would have a better chance of getting this played.

188
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,240
If I now insulted you, or cussed, or did something amusing?

189
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Instead, I will simply sign off with folder.

190
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
No, an atomic rod.

191
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Not at all, man. Not insult. Are you kidding me?

192
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,240
No, I want to know more about this. You know, we were in Los Angeles on Friday,

193
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Ron and I went for, I think, would it be a final meeting before we close a deal

194
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,240
with the pretty interesting organization, which I'll be able to tell you about.

195
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Hopefully, this week, or certainly next week,

196
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
shouldn't take too long to close everything up.

197
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,240
It's a very interesting partnership we're entering into.

198
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,240
So, when we're on the road, we really get a time to really just chat and shoot the

199
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,240
shit and when you're on an airplane, you've got the time.

200
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,240
You know, hanging out at, I don't just remember to say this about something about our trip back.

201
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,240
And we had a really good conversation about alternative energy,

202
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,240
and being, it started actually with our thoughts about

203
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,240
the U.S. pulling out of Iraq and George Bush and dependent on oil.

204
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,240
And I think that I'm going to have to invite Mr. Bloom as a sabond Tom,

205
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,240
because it's great. Whenever we have, we can get pretty heated and heated conversations.

206
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,240
We don't necessarily agree with each other on topics.

207
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
But this was a good one.

208
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,240
So, I'm definitely going to bring him on.

209
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,240
And one of the things I said was, hey, you know, this atomic rod

210
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,240
atoms, he's got these, you know, he has a company building nukes for your back yard,

211
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,240
nuclear reactors, and I'm like, I totally would be, I'll be all over that.

212
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,240
I'd love to try that out. And of course, Ron immediately says, oh, yeah,

213
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,240
yeah, you'll be glowing green.

214
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,240
You know, and I probably all stereotypical remarks about atomic energy about

215
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
a danger and the waste and all that.

216
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
So, we'll have to have atomic rod on as well.

217
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,240
But today, it is completely savant free.

218
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Anyway, what I wanted to say is, so it was just a one day up and back trip.

219
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,240
We took, I don't know, the United Shuttle or whatever it is.

220
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
And on the way back, so we were a little bit early.

221
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
We had a 330 flight.

222
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,240
We were at the airport around 120.

223
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,240
And we wanted to see if we'd get on the two o'clock shuttle.

224
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,240
And because the automatic checking kiosk said,

225
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
well, you could get on the three o'clock shuttle,

226
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,240
but you know, you have to print out your tickets and go to the gate if you

227
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
want to get an earlier shuttle.

228
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
So, we printed out our boarding passes.

229
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,240
And there was a huge line for the two o'clock flight.

230
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,240
And it was like, I don't know, it must have been 50 or 75 school kids on some kind of

231
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,240
excursion or convention they were going to.

232
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,240
And so we're waiting in this line and it's taken a really long time.

233
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,240
We're kind of debating, you know, should we get so we do even try and wait in this line,

234
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,240
should we just get some of the eat and shoot the shit about stuff.

235
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
And I see over to the right.

236
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
I said, hey, look man, it's ice cube.

237
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
You know, the wrapper ice cube.

238
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,240
And he was kind of over in the corner with his,

239
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,240
I guess his body guard or his guy is a minor.

240
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,240
And so I'm looking at the situation right.

241
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,240
And I'm like, we're desperately trying to get on this flight to get back earlier.

242
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,240
There's set 50 to 75 school kids.

243
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
And there's ice cube.

244
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,240
And I said, Ron, I think we should step out of this line.

245
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
I don't think we should try and get on this flight.

246
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
And he says, why?

247
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
I said, dude, think about it.

248
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
This is always the flight that crashes.

249
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
It has 75 school kids and ice cube.

250
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,240
And if this thing crashes, we won't even mention in the fucking article.

251
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
So we went home on the 330.

252
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
Yeah, hi, y'all.

253
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
I'm going to call on you on this thing here.

254
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,240
And I hope I got the right number.

255
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,240
I'm listening over there on that show.

256
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
Now, I used to listen on that show.

257
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,240
I told him that serious thing there.

258
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,240
And all of a sudden, it's just just proof.

259
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Now, I don't know what right to come with that.

260
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,240
But I tried to y'all in on my hand radio.

261
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,240
And I can't eat y'all on that night.

262
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,240
So I hope I got to know my number here.

263
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,240
And this dude has signs.

264
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,240
And what I was wanting to know is, that's here and all this stuff on the daily source

265
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:19,240
and I don't know about how come you want to have so many servants on your show.

266
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Things like that's going to be a hard thing for you to come by is to find so many people

267
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,240
who's wanting to, you know, just do what you want and say, you know,

268
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,240
don't say what's wrong with the dude and all, but that's what I want to call.

269
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,240
The reason I call is, I have a problem.

270
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Sometime when I'm listening to the show and I got to show loaded up on my iPod

271
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:54,240
and I'm listening to it, it seems like it's coming in kind of softly.

272
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Anyway, I don't know if that makes much sense or if it's because I need to

273
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,240
get a new something or other.

274
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,240
But if I need to get a new something or other, I hope you give me a call because I

275
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,240
could probably help you be a servant in that regard anyway.

276
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,240
I sure do listen to them shows and I shall do appreciate them.

277
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,240
And if you won't play this, you've got my permission to do it, I guess.

278
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:32,240
But what I want to say is, how come when I'm listening to that show and

279
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:40,240
talking about servants is, is it sounds kind of funny?

280
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
I don't know.

281
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,240
And it seems like you want to talk a lot on there about toilet paper and things

282
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,240
and scratching and folding and all that.

283
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Yeah.

284
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
I don't get it.

285
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
I don't understand.

286
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,240
But y'all keep up the good work there and I'm going to listen for you over their own

287
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
series.

288
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,240
I hope y'all come back on there because I listen to that and I let my

289
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,240
water listen to that and we sing y'all there.

290
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Y'all keep listening to that as you know.

291
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
And it's dirt hard for us.

292
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
I talk to you sometimes.

293
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Well, there you have it.

294
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,240
That was the serious satellite radio listener, I guess.

295
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,240
That's the first response I've received from any.

296
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
That's so fucking sad.

297
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Please don't tell me that we were doing that show and no one was listening.

298
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,240
That would be, that would just be so disappointing.

299
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
There's no numbers.

300
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
There's no arbitron.

301
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
There's no rating.

302
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,240
There's no surveys to know who's listening to what.

303
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,240
But that is the first response I got.

304
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,240
I'm not quite sure that our redneck savant was was real.

305
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Hey Adam.

306
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Eric's mother here.

307
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Oh boy, you remember I had that little conversation with Eric and

308
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,240
and as a girlfriend both in the Jersey boys cast.

309
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,240
Mm-hmm.

310
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Oh boy, we're always proposing all kinds of things of a sexual nature.

311
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,240
Well, here's Eric Bergen's mom.

312
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,240
Oh, no, and as Allison Lee, the host of craft cast.

313
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Not scrap cast.

314
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
No, yeah, I screwed that up.

315
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
I'm sorry about that.

316
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Craft cast.

317
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Scrap cast is cool too though.

318
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Nothing wrong with scrap cast.

319
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Actually enjoy scrap cast.

320
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
It's on your podjo network.

321
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
But on the host of craft cast.

322
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Got it.

323
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Got it.

324
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
So, sorry I missed you and San Francisco.

325
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,240
I was hoping to be there when Eric did that interview with you.

326
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,240
I'm looking forward to hearing that on Green Room Radio.

327
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,240
And yes, aren't they adorable?

328
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Little love birds out there.

329
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
They sure are here.

330
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
And they show up Jersey boys.

331
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,240
And it was so much fun getting to hear them on your show.

332
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,240
And I have one other, I have a suggestion at them.

333
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Please, please, please.

334
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,240
Can you put a channel on podjo network for the crafter?

335
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
Could be under an art category?

336
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
It's a huge category out there.

337
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,240
And it'd be great to, you know, take advantage of that.

338
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
So, that'd be really fabulous.

339
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
Appreciate it.

340
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,240
So, I look forward to maybe I'll run into an LA when everyone's out there.

341
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Yes, that show is going to Los Angeles.

342
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Fair exciting.

343
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Big opening in there on May.

344
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
And, um, and that's it.

345
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm forward to talking to you again soon.

346
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
Take care.

347
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Bye.

348
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Thanks, fellas.

349
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Well, so here's, uh, here's something interesting about your request.

350
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Now, first of all, you know, that we're cranking up this help podjo

351
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
suckless campaign.

352
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,240
And I believe the beginning of the month.

353
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,240
So, or the first week, so that's this week and next week.

354
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Uh, we're coming up with a pretty exciting opportunity for you to really help us suck less.

355
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,240
Um, and in a little more structured manner than all of the fantastic emails and PDF files,

356
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,240
as well, people are creating entire presentations of how we can be better.

357
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,240
I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.

358
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,240
Most of it, of course, focuses on the play button, the XML buttons.

359
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
I mean, all that stuff.

360
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
We think we can take this a couple steps further.

361
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:14,240
You know, first of all, it's not like we're unaware of stuff that's confusing, not right,

362
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
illogical, et cetera, et cetera.

363
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:23,240
This program is brought to you by TythonLPM.

364
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Check out AngieB's unwinded on wine.potjo.com.

365
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Now what you can do, dear Allison, and this is one of the things that's manual right now,

366
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,240
we're going to turn this into a more of an automatic feature.

367
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
You can create your own channel.

368
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:43,240
You may know this already, but give it a try, um, by going into your, uh, into your collection,

369
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,240
and any, uh, podshow, any podcast, in fact, that you can find anywhere, you know,

370
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,240
just search for it throughout the network, you can add that to your channel.

371
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,240
So why don't you build a craft crafting channel, whatever you want to call it,

372
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
and then we can promote that to the program guide,

373
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,240
and then you will, in fact, you will effectively be maintaining that channel.

374
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,240
And part of the upgrade that we're going to be doing, the next release will be, uh,

375
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,240
these channels will be propping, you know, we'll have that on channel pages.

376
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
You may have seen the new channel module.

377
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
If you haven't, you need to check this out.

378
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,240
It's really an awesome way to manage, uh, your shows that you listen to, um,

379
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,240
you can, uh, you can also manage the order that there are all kinds of stuff that, uh,

380
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,240
that is already good and stuff that is even better still coming.

381
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,240
But do that, Allison, let me know about it because then we can promote that into a program guide,

382
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,240
and we can, make that a, uh, channel, and it will be, you know, like something that

383
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,240
will be promoted throughout the network, but you can continue to maintain it.

384
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,240
So if you feel a show should be in that channel, or if you feel a show no longer belongs

385
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
in the channel, you'll be the one that's controlling it.

386
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,240
So, um, please, please help us out.

387
00:21:49,240 --> 00:22:04,240
Okay, so you don't need to be sending in any more emails.

388
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
I think we pretty much got it.

389
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,240
We have an entire survey that consists of, uh, I don't know how many questions it is.

390
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
Um, it's a lot, actually.

391
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,240
And if you, uh, participate in the panel, this is going to be a gigantic survey,

392
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:27,240
not only will you help pod show suckless, but you'll also win points with which you can get free stuff.

393
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,240
I don't think this guy was pick up a Ferrari doing that.

394
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
So stay tuned, you'll hear about it on the show.

395
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,240
And we're here and says hi, Adam.

396
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,240
I've been listening with much amusement to your headphone issues.

397
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,240
And after you're description of, uh, what you now go through to avoid the headphone

398
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
earlobe problem.

399
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,240
I think it's time to pass on details of the ones I use.

400
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,240
I myself have fairly big ears and hates.

401
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
I hadn't even considered that.

402
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
And hate smaller headphones that press on my ears.

403
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,240
But a year ago, friend turned me onto the Senheiser HD 555 model.

404
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
I strongly recommend you give them a try.

405
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
They're open headphones.

406
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,240
They leak a bit of noise and don't block out all outside noise.

407
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,240
But the airpiece is large enough to fit my entire ear inside.

408
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,240
As an angled speaker, so my ear barely touches anything once they're on.

409
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
And the padding has a very nice velvety texture.

410
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
Very familiar with these Senheiser headphones.

411
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
Um, again, here's the problem.

412
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Um, I need to have a closed off system because I use compression on my microphone.

413
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,240
Now, what does that mean?

414
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,240
It is intended to pull up softer, uh, noise and level it out with louder noise,

415
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
which, of course, it limits down a bit.

416
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,240
So if I were to have an open headphone like such, you see,

417
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,240
I'm only just opening my headphone a little bit, just the tiniest bit

418
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,240
and you already hear it starts to feed back.

419
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:03,240
So, um, I will try a Patricia has a set of AKGs, the 271s,

420
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,240
which I've just huge, um, uh, what do you call them?

421
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Uh, earpieces.

422
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,240
So they would fit probably quite comfortably.

423
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,240
But the really the problem is it fits over the ear,

424
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
but then it's right underneath the earlobe,

425
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,240
which is where, you know, it's basically rubbing.

426
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,240
And that's what causes the irritation,

427
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
bacteria gets in there.

428
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
Of course, these headphones.

429
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
And now I'm also cleaning my headphones.

430
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
I should do, you know, you get like a hygiene kit.

431
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
I have that from, uh, from the aircraft,

432
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
including the aircraft headphones, all that stuff.

433
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
It's really important.

434
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
So I am kind of looking for the ultimate headphones.

435
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,240
And here's another, uh, another example.

436
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,240
Hi Adam, it's AG here again about your headphone problem.

437
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,240
I think what's happening is that, uh, if you're using headphones

438
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,240
for a long period, this can cause a lot of discomfort

439
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,240
and a guy like you ought to have the best headphones in the world.

440
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,240
So I would suggest you take a look at greater labs headphones

441
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,240
at golf, a Romeo, Alpha, Delta, Oscar.

442
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,240
I've used them now for several months,

443
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
and I just wouldn't go back.

444
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Normally with headphones to increase the base response

445
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
and the possibility also the loudness.

446
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,240
You need to clamp them to your head by pressing your hands

447
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
against them with greater labs.

448
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,240
If you do that, you get a totally opposite result.

449
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,240
They were best when the equalizer is turned off.

450
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,240
They're not great to look at, but boy, do they perform better

451
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,240
than any other headphones I've used?

452
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
Hope that helps.

453
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Alright man, thank you.

454
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
And I did check out great old labs that looked at the headset.

455
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,240
I'm not going to have to find a place where I can try them out

456
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,240
because again, they are not closed headphones

457
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
so they don't fit over the ear.

458
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,240
They are large, and they do have really big padding

459
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,240
so and there's very directional speakers in the headphones.

460
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
And they kind of look like, these things look like the roles

461
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
of the voice of headphones.

462
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,240
So besides the fact that they'll probably have a fantastic sound,

463
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
which is I don't really care about the sound.

464
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
It doesn't have to sound all that good.

465
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,240
It's important, but you know what I'm saying.

466
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
That's just my reference.

467
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
As long as it sounds good for you,

468
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
but it really has to close off that sound

469
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,240
so we don't get the feedback.

470
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,240
So I'll see if I can find a place in London.

471
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,240
I'm going on Friday to Big Smoke.

472
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Because I guess who's going to meet me at two o'clock

473
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,240
at the UK crash pad or the shortage office?

474
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Oh, yes.

475
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Comics trip blogger's going to be there.

476
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
We're finally going to meet in person.

477
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
Hey Adam, it's Mark.

478
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,240
I just wanted to comment real quickly on the whole Alec Baldwin thing.

479
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Now, I don't condone this type of behavior to a child.

480
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
But in the case of Alec Baldwin,

481
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,240
I do understand a little bit where it's coming from

482
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,240
because he, like any of us, is a product of his environment.

483
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,240
And that environment happens to be the entertainment industry

484
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
where this type of discourse happens all the time

485
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,240
ranging from topics such as why didn't my car pick me up on time

486
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,240
to why is there no vanilla pudding at the craft services table?

487
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
And I'm not even kidding about this.

488
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
So you have somebody like Alec Baldwin who's just coming off

489
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
a reasonably hit show 30 rock,

490
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
which has already been renewed for the fall.

491
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,240
So he knows he has a job that starts back up sometime in June.

492
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,240
And during his hiatus, he's shooting a movie.

493
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,240
So he has very limited time to do that.

494
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,240
And the movie, of course, I'm sure they've scheduled

495
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
around his availability.

496
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,240
But that means they're probably shooting really long days.

497
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,240
And his ability to actually go and pick up a phone

498
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,240
and call his family, well, that's got to be scheduled

499
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
into his day.

500
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
And I'm probably way ahead at the time.

501
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,240
So it's got to be very frustrating when you have something

502
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,240
a very long, you know, 12, 16 hour day on the set.

503
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
And you have a small window of opportunity

504
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
to actually talk to somebody that you love

505
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
and they're not there.

506
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,240
People that with the standard behavior of any pre-teen girl

507
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,240
and Alec's acrimonious relationship

508
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,240
with the girl's kuku bird mother, Kim Bassinger

509
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
and the pressure of shooting a movie.

510
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,240
Well, you know, I think you have your external influences

511
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
right there.

512
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
So in my humble opinion, you know,

513
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,240
pointing a finger at Alec Baldwin for this type of behavior

514
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,240
is very much like pointing a finger at American tourists

515
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,240
in Europe for acting like, well, Americans or pointing the finger

516
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,240
at somebody from Arkansas when they come over to your house

517
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,240
at F-Sex with your livestock.

518
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
But that's beside the point.

519
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,240
In my experience, most actors are babies.

520
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
And oftentimes, you have to shrug off their

521
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,240
aberrant behavior as diminished capacity.

522
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,240
And while I'm no Alec Baldwin apologist by any means,

523
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
though what he did was wrong,

524
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,240
I think whoever leaked this voicemail to the press

525
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,240
did something even more wrong and even more hurtful

526
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,240
to that little girl in the long run.

527
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,240
But there's Hollywood for you.

528
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,240
And if you like this kind of childish Hollywood behavior,

529
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
you can go pick up a copy of my book

530
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
where's my fucking latte.

531
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,240
And other stories about being an assistant in Hollywood

532
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,240
comes out May 15th available now on Amazon for pre-order.

533
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
Thanks Adam, I'll get you later.

534
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
You're such a sleaze mark.

535
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,240
I can't believe you really have been going there with that comment.

536
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
I'm like, okay, Mark's got an opinion.

537
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,240
And all it was is just a wind up to promote your freaking book.

538
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
Which, by the way, is a pretty good book

539
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,240
because I did read it on the plane going out the San Francisco.

540
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,240
Yeah, what's your basically saying

541
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,240
what Robin and Susanne said?

542
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,240
A lot of stuff is going on Alec's life,

543
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,240
and he wasn't completely focused.

544
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
You know, kids are kids, man.

545
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
They do shitty stupid stuff.

546
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
They really do.

547
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,240
Hey, I got a voicemail from my daughter.

548
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
I got a play for you.

549
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
I'll do that tomorrow.

550
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Okay.

551
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Because right now, I want to take a few minutes away.

552
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,240
Actually, something else.

553
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
This is,

554
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,240
so I was getting ready to leave on Saturday.

555
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,240
I always take the Saturday flight and I arrive on Sunday.

556
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,240
That's kind of the way it works with international time travel.

557
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,240
And I listened to a lot of podcast.

558
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,240
You know, if people wonder how come I never go out to dinner,

559
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,240
how come I never show up at clubs, at premieres,

560
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
at all these swanky things,

561
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,240
it's, well, not only do I no longer get invited,

562
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,240
but it's also because I'm,

563
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
I'm doing my job.

564
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
I'm listening to stuff.

565
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
I'm trying to feel how our network sounds.

566
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
I want to see what other people are doing.

567
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
What's the vibe?

568
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,240
What's the zeitgeist?

569
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,240
And one of the shows I listen to is show girls.

570
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
Now, this is a very interesting project.

571
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,240
It, it kind of started organically.

572
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,240
I mean, my mind will just get the show girls page here.

573
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
Hold on a second.

574
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Let me, it's,

575
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,240
I was at some shirts showgirls.punchow.com.

576
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
That's, well, make sure I don't miss,

577
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
miss represented who's on the show.

578
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,240
I think it came together at,

579
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,240
the podcast new media expo either last year,

580
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
the year before.

581
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,240
It was, it's been building.

582
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
And essentially, it's a combination of,

583
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,240
a pod show affiliated female podcasters

584
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,240
and Frank McMahon,

585
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
who, of course,

586
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
produces room-a-girls uncut.

587
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
And here we go.

588
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
Each episode of Cali Lewis,

589
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
from Geet Brief TV,

590
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,240
share from Rock and Roll TV,

591
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,240
KFC, from the pod check podcast.

592
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,240
So I don't think it's actually on the network anymore.

593
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,240
Angie B, from the chill cast,

594
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,240
soccer girl from soccer girl incorporated

595
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,240
and Carla and Karen from room-a-girls,

596
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
along with Franklin McMahon,

597
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,240
and they bring insights into everything from world events,

598
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
entertainment technology, as well as behind the scenes.

599
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
Okay.

600
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
It's a fun show because you hear,

601
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
it's kind of like,

602
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,240
in a way it's like the view.

603
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,240
Only it's all done through Skype,

604
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,240
so it's a little tougher to

605
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,240
instigate a real conversation amongst the participants.

606
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,240
But Frank has a really good job of kind of,

607
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
it's more like McLaughlin group.

608
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
There you go, Frank.

609
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,240
Frank really manages the conversation.

610
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
It's really interesting because women

611
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
often have a different perspective on things from men,

612
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,240
who are in joy listening to it immensely.

613
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,240
So Saturday, I'm listening to the most recent episode,

614
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
episode number six.

615
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
And then listen to what I hear.

616
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,240
Yeah, the pod show has a current limit.

617
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,240
I'm hoping they're going to be upgraded this week,

618
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
and they have it.

619
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
Right now, just happened today.

620
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,240
Yeah, they have a limit on.

621
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
So now that we're doing HD,

622
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
and Apple TV and stuff,

623
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
the shows are getting bigger.

624
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Yeah.

625
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
That's many people here.

626
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
We'll be affected by it.

627
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
In fact, we should all.

628
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
We should all complain about it over there, huh?

629
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
What are you saying?

630
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
There's a limit on something?

631
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
Well, it's true.

632
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Yeah.

633
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
I think it's 200 megabyte,

634
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,240
which is, I mean, if you're doing MP3s in audio,

635
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,240
and smaller like 5, 10-minute videos,

636
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
it's fine.

637
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,240
But once you get into like higher res and Apple TV,

638
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,240
format and longer shows,

639
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,240
you upload a pod show.

640
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
It uploads,

641
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
but it doesn't take.

642
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,240
It doesn't actually go the distance.

643
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
Yeah, wow.

644
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
It could do is give you an error message

645
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
or warn you beforehand.

646
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
It could totally stay like, you know,

647
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,240
no files over 200 MB.

648
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
You know, they'll be easy,

649
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,240
but no, just says nothing.

650
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Hey, let's all complain.

651
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Yeah.

652
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
It's working on it.

653
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
It's all complain.

654
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Let's all complain.

655
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
It's like two minutes.

656
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,240
It's like, let's all complain.

657
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Let's not complain.

658
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
You know, I'm all for, you know,

659
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
it's amazing that the listeners

660
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
are more productive,

661
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
proactive,

662
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,240
and inspiring than these women

663
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,240
when it comes to helping pod show suck less.

664
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
You know,

665
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,240
first of all,

666
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
an upload limit,

667
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,240
which was chosen at random,

668
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
many, many moons ago,

669
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,240
200 MB was indeed quite an amazing amount

670
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,240
per episode availability

671
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,240
for upload and storage space

672
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,240
before there was any HD or Apple TV.

673
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,240
And it's quite easy for us to up that limit.

674
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
I don't believe any other service

675
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
allows you to upload that much.

676
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,240
And there's a couple of reasons for it.

677
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
The main one being you don't want to,

678
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
you know, hand out like a gigabyte

679
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
because that's exactly what people,

680
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
or even 500 megs,

681
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,240
people can store an entire movie there.

682
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
But that's just one minor problem.

683
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,240
Also, it's not completely free.

684
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
You know, if you do go ahead,

685
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
buy a 50 gig,

686
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,240
buy a 100 gig hard drive.

687
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
So after X amount of episodes,

688
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
your hard drive will be full.

689
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,240
You can calculate the price.

690
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,240
It costs actual money,

691
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,240
but it's certainly willing to consider it.

692
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,240
In fact, I've already asked for the

693
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,240
allotment to be up.

694
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,240
My general feeling is let's make it 500 megabytes.

695
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,240
But what just really earned me,

696
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
you know,

697
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
let's all complain.

698
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
Let's complain.

699
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Why don't you be productive?

700
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,240
It's not complaining.

701
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
Like we're evil.

702
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,240
And oh,

703
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,240
you could have at least given that some,

704
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,240
is that Angie B?

705
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,240
It's unbelievable, Angie.

706
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
Ah.

707
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,240
Okay, hold on.

708
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
I'm just getting worked up here

709
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
because the real anger is about to come.

710
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
Okay.

711
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,240
Address is quoted from a bucket.

712
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,240
I was doing some web surfing with weekend.

713
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,240
I saw a story that just scared the hell out of me,

714
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
and I thought I should give you a call about it.

715
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
It's a story that was,

716
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
and it was,

717
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,240
and it was in daily chaos in a couple of other places

718
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
about the I,

719
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,240
and their royalty collection system.

720
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,240
How they're collecting royalties now.

721
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
With a compressor,

722
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
can say,

723
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
compulsory license,

724
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,240
which means that they connect,

725
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,240
like life is now for sounds that are even given,

726
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
given from,

727
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,240
are they even good permission to have their music played royalties free,

728
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,240
that are collecting music,

729
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,240
and then the artists are asked to register with the I,

730
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,240
to get their money.

731
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,240
But they're just holding this money,

732
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
and the I,

733
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,240
is trying to collect it on anything,

734
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
on any kind of streamed music,

735
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
so we don't have a choice.

736
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
They sound like the story could be,

737
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
or it is about like this whole system,

738
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,240
makes it sound,

739
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,600
makes you tell us we can't ever have toxic music and that scares the hell out of

740
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,800
maybe can I'm sure that does for a lot of podcasters use the podzic music that work music

741
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,200
does we know that those are some already given their permission to allow us to play the music

742
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,800
I don't mean to sit here you're thought to bother and I thought just bring us to your

743
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,800
attention and if we can start a conversation about it it does set it we should be calling

744
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,680
our our Congressional representative is because it's the GAMPS can see what the RAA is doing

745
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,120
if all the smoke they're collecting from these artists who brought you in their permission

746
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:18,560
they don't want their royalty collected so I'm like some of getting screwed here if I

747
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,400
some of the co-incularism so I'm potentially I'm thicker yeah go excuse me Corey thank you so

748
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,120
much and I received several emails about this and you know my previous conversation with

749
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:38,000
Doc Serals about web radio and the copyright royalty boards legal win I believe which

750
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:45,200
goes into effect on the 15th of May which I understood to be a different form of pricing

751
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,400
for licensed music and you know my stance on that it's like okay these guys own their music

752
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,680
if they want to jack up the rates for other people to use it in novel ways such as web radio

753
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,480
so be it you know that's the it's applying demand so they're going to diminish their the demand

754
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,960
for this stuff and because of the because the prices just too high so and I'm okay with that you know

755
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,560
it's a bummer and I wish that I could play all kinds of all these some I have been able to get

756
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,520
away with because I know the owners of all the copyright but most things that I'd like to play

757
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,560
now and if I've played it then I've totally broken the law and I'm quite aware of it but what was

758
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,880
pointed out so two things first of all I always thought it was daily cost but didn't make so much

759
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,360
sense now so the daily chaos but it spelled Delta Alpha India Lima Yankee Kilo Oscar Sierra

760
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:44,000
really delved into this this new rate hike and found something very interesting it appears that

761
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,920
sound exchange which is it's members are several large labels and one or two large independent

762
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:59,440
labels who are members of the RIA have received a statutory and compulsory license or that they are

763
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:07,040
they are allowed to enforce a statutory statutory compulsory license which means

764
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,440
and let me just quote something from the article here let's see this two quotes I should give you

765
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,680
the recent US copyright office ruling regarding web casting designated sound exchange to

766
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,480
collect and distribute to all nonmembers as well as its members the library of Congress issued

767
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,120
is this decision with rates in terms to govern the compulsory license for webcasters internet

768
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,800
only radio and simulcasters retransmissions so this is from the sound exchange FAQs now the

769
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,880
sound recording copyright owners and that means anyone who has created interestingly enough

770
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,800
it doesn't necessarily have to be music but if you've recorded a sound recording

771
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,920
then you are a so called SRCO so I'm actually also an SRC and that's really interesting hold on to

772
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,600
that thought for a second so the sound recording copyright owners are subject to a compulsory

773
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,440
license for the use of their music sound exchange was established to administer the collection

774
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,040
and distribution of royalties from such compulsory license taken by non interactive streaming

775
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,560
services that you satellite cable or internet methods of distribution so there's a whole bunch of

776
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:19,520
big huge pitfalls in this and the first being what is internet radio and what exactly is a

777
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,360
non interactive streaming service now from an experiential and from a technical standpoint

778
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:31,520
the difference between streaming audio and downloading it there's really not a lot of

779
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,120
difference in fact there's all kinds of little gotchas in these are laws of articles of law

780
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,680
about the difference between streaming that does or does not temporarily maintain you

781
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,280
is not temporarily maintained on your computer which with the progressive download is arguably

782
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,320
exactly the same so the point that Cory was making and others are saying hey you know if this is

783
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,880
a compulsory license it means that regardless of what type of if you're not even distributed

784
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,400
if you don't even have a record deal if you just make a song you put a creative

785
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:11,600
commons license on it or if you use the podcast music network license it is a license by the way

786
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,720
it even states as such so when you sign up as a podcast or producer you are agreeing to the

787
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,600
license when you sign up as an artist or as a label and you put songs up there you are agreeing

788
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,600
to a license it is an actual legal document it's a license it's not just some kind of

789
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,400
really nearly thing it was well thought out cost a lot of money hit lawyers fees to get it exactly

790
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,880
right and also working with the community to do that to hone it to make it even better that would

791
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:44,240
technically mean that if you created a web radio let's so let's just call the stream for now

792
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,920
of Ponsa music or music license under a different license such as the creative commons

793
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:57,680
that you would still as a webcaster you would still be liable for fees and as I read it with

794
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,040
and you know and I do understand what a statutory license is it means essentially no one has to

795
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,240
contact you only have to contact anyone just by the fact you're doing it means you pretty much agree

796
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:16,560
to do it so that that could be very gnarly now again this is not because I don't

797
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,760
think people should be able to make money off of their art but we have a license in place

798
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,160
seems to be working very well there are alternative ways of making money with your music

799
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:33,440
through concerts and merchandise and yes even just selling it directly a DRM free so the the

800
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,840
danger here is that this type of statutory and compulsory license could pretty easily be applied to

801
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:49,680
podcast and it's just one easy step away so that is fucked up and that's definitely not okay

802
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,160
so I'm going to need to find some savants to talk about this and they will have to be in legal

803
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,680
profession I'm going to get Brian Longest who did the original drafts of the podcast

804
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,360
music license and who is a lawyer he is also a director of operations he's a copyright lawyer

805
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:16,400
patent lawyer and some other kind of lawyer he's a fucking lawyer I'm going to have to ask him to

806
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:26,400
delve into this because I did find while looking so it's the US copyright office that makes this law

807
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:36,960
and and says okay this is what statutory means and this is what compulsory means and this is how it

808
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,360
works now I just want to say as a brief side note there is a bill that has been introduced to stop

809
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:54,640
this particular hike in fees for webcasters for streaming radio and I will put a link to that

810
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,720
in the show notes and I think it's good that they're intervening and if anything trying to slow

811
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,800
down this may 15th deadline but they're not talking about the compulsory nature of the license

812
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,960
they're only talking about the the fee structure so you know it's not really applicable to what I'm

813
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,400
talking about right now this is this is a very dangerous place that we're in I think because

814
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:26,080
and let me just what is the word I'm looking for waiver here we go so now I'm looking at the

815
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:39,760
at a copyright law see I'm not a lawyer I'll put a link to this as well title 17 chapter 92

816
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,640
one whatever the hell it is transfer and waiver the rights conferred by subsection A that's where

817
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,160
discusses the compulsory license may not be transferred but those rights may be waived if the author

818
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,720
expressly agrees to such waiver in a written instrument signed by the author such instrument shall

819
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,320
specifically identify the work and uses of that work to which the waiver applies and the waiver

820
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:08,160
shall apply only to the work and uses so defined in the case of a joint work prepared by two more

821
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,640
authors a waiver of rights under this paragraph made by one such author waves such rights for all authors

822
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,640
so if I read this properly and this is what I need some help on this is where I'm going to get the

823
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,160
savants to work and maybe jersey taught I know it taught I I know you only do like ambulance

824
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,400
chasing work but you could at least have a look at the articles because you're much better at reading

825
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:35,280
that stuff than I am it appears to me that you may be able to put a waiver in place and in essence

826
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,880
the creative commons or the positive music license would be exactly that now I don't know if

827
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,840
that means we have to send off all these waivers to sound exchange so that they can know that

828
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:53,840
anything played by these artists is exempt that will have to look into now I do think it is

829
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:58,720
interesting and that's what I just stumbled on a couple of minutes ago they're talking about

830
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,640
sound recording so in essence that would also mean that if someone used the daily source code

831
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,240
because I sang on it because I sang on it right so that just constitute this entire thing is

832
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,600
one big hip hop song wrap with a little bit of a chorus in the middle then I could also start to

833
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,800
collect fees and probably you know if we don't get any further I could probably edit the

834
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,880
audit the shit out of them because you're even if you're a non member you're allowed to audit

835
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,360
and say okay how many times is my shit played we could really follow them up so before calling

836
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,000
for a complete jihad on this I want to get some savants involved if you're a lawyer if you

837
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,280
understand this if you have access to a copyright lawyer please I'm also calling out to the electronic

838
