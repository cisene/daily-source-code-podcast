1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I, everybody, welcome to the Daily Source Code, best of Charlie episode number four.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm at him coming to you in a, well, it still is the official curry cottage, although it's

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
starting to get a little bit, um, discombobulated, not empty yet because the move doesn't

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,160
actually take place until next week, but we're already starting to bring boxes over stuff

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,440
is getting put into boxes and, uh, and I'm spending a lot of my time changing services, still

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,520
in the midst of trying to get, uh, broadband all set up before when we move into the new

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,600
place, which, uh, I can pretty much guarantee won't work, is not going to happen, although

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,680
the telephone did finally switch over yesterday. So, um, so that part is working. Of course,

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,720
now we have no home phone here, so I had to do the old star 21 star to forward all, um,

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,520
by the way, it's not called call forwarding in the UK. It's called call diversion. Took me

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,240
wild to find that one. Um, so, uh, you know, and we've been, uh, been over the house, uh,

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,280
a couple of times each day, um, just getting stuff ready, uh, the house is, uh, it's pretty

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,320
much exactly the way we want it, so we're real happy to move in, uh, other, uh, so for the

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,240
broadband, uh, what I've decided to do, since I'm sure there's going to be a one to two week

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,280
overlap before we actually get everything cranking, um, I've decided to get one of those

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:25,160
vote of phone, um, broadband via G3, USB dongles. They claim that you can get speeds of up to

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,280
1.5 megabits per second. I'm pretty sure, uh, that's just the advertised speed in my, uh, my speed

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,080
may vary due to road and weather conditions. Uh, but it doesn't really matter as long as I can, uh,

19
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,800
as long as I can do, you know, the normal email stuff and calendar and just be connected, uh,

20
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,160
and particularly for Christina and for Patricia, who also has become quite a connected gal herself,

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,120
and, uh, and then for the occasional download of, uh, of some, uh, podcasts, but it looks like

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm going to have to be, uh, going off to Starbucks or maybe in December, Cisco to get some true

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:04,200
bandwidth while we wait for, um, the broadband to be, uh, to be reconnected in the new GF. Um,

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,520
so I have another best of Charlie lined up for you today, which is sponsored in part by Stomp

25
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,440
the Yard, which is a new movie coming out, um, on January 12th. And if you want to know more about

26
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,000
this movie, go to StompThePodcast.com. Tony Costas will tell you all about it, and he's doing regular

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,040

28
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,240
the 14th will be able to see how well it did, uh, uh, that's probably the opening weekend. If, uh,

29
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,720
if the little man, uh, exercise, we, uh, we took together. If that's any, um, any precedents, I'm sure this

30
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,560
is going to be a big hit as well. Also brought to you, a part by GoDaddy if you want a great deal

31
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,240
of the main name, go to GoDaddy.com, and you check out code DSC that's Delta Sierra Charlie. DSC

32
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:53,080
three, uh, for the great savings. And I just want to let you know that just as, uh, I'd pretty much

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,080
given up on, uh, on TV again here in the UK, we had some pretty good stuff over the holidays. Um, and

34
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,200
I do love the BBC. I love the stuff they do, but I got out a little bit lean, um, right after the

35
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:13,720
new years. And yesterday, I'm so happy this show is back on the air. It is, uh, celebrity big brother

36
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,080
once again in the UK. And they've got a great lineup that I'm going to be following. Uh, I'm totally

37
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,120
hooked on this stuff. As you know, I was there. Would big brother has a concept was born. In fact,

38
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,160
it was called Golden Cage back then. Um, so I've always been a fan of the show. And I love

39
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,800
with who they have on this year. Check this out. I'm just pulling this from the, uh, what is this?

40
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,560
The Daily Mirror. Uh, here are the, uh, the contestants who will be in the house for 25 days.

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,760
They're not really deal liberties anymore. Well, uh, although we start off with Donnie Turett,

42
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,080
you know, what I'll do is a poly Hudson, uh, writes on the celebrity page of the Daily Mirror.

43
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,320
I will, I'll just read her little bits next to each of the, yeah, each of the contestants.

44
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,800
Uh, you might be thinking, who, but trust me, he's literally a spinal tap-esque hilarious genius.

45
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,560
Great, great booking. No, really a great booking. Donnie Turett is the lead singer of Towers of London,

46
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,480
uh, Christina knew the band. Then there's Dirk Benedict, the man who's gone from 18 to Z list in

47
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,040
expecting 25 days of absolute hell. Here's hoping. I'd also like him to fall in love with Cleo, please.

48
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,440
So, you fuck that. She's horrible, what she wrote. Okay. So, Dirk Benedict, better known as

49
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,080
face from the 18 and, uh, Han Solo. No, not Han Solo. I'm sorry, that was Harrison Ford.

50
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,840
Uh, who, Dirk Benedict was in, uh, was he buck Rogers? That's what it was in. Yeah.

51
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:46,360
Then Cleo Rockus, who, um, was the girl with the nice boots always leaning forward in the, was it

52
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:54,440
the candy ever show? I think, uh, English comedian. Then there's, um, disputed and kind of

53
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,440
grumpy old guy, yet perverted grumpy old guy, filmed director Ken Russell, who's in the house.

54
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,120
Then there's Carol Malone, who is a gossip magazine reporter and boy, she's enjoying all the

55
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,240
celebrity. I always knew it. People who write about celebrities want to be celebrities.

56
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,440
Then there's Ian from steps, or better known as H from steps, who coincidentally came out

57
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,760
of the closet 24 hours before going into the big brother house. So, uh, let's use that

58
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,040
with you to take a, yeah, it's probably the token homosexual. So, obviously, it's how they're putting

59
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:38,200
this together. But a big surprise here. Leo Sayer. Uh, you know, Leo Sayer from the 70s.

60
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,800
What was, uh, you know, I can't dance. You know, I can't dance. Uh, you know what tomorrow,

61
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,040
I'll, uh, for tomorrow's best of Charlie, I'll find Leo Sayer, so I'm play a bit for you.

62
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:55,960
Then there's a lead singer of S Club 7, Joe Omera. And then there's a girlfriend of a, uh, a

63
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,320
well-known, uh, football player, Daniel Lloyd. And then there is an award-winning

64
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,080
Bollywood actress, Shilpa Shetty, who's also in the big brother house. Beautiful. Like,

65
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,560
I almost like an Indian princess. And her mission is to show the world that, uh, show the world

66
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,600
that there are a lot of misconceptions about Indian people. And finally, I love this, germane Jackson

67
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,360
of, uh, that's, uh, Michael's older brother who I've met a couple times. It's a really nice guy.

68
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,520
But what the heck is he doing in the big brother house? It's going to be, um, a very interesting

69
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,040
season for sure. And the gofers are back bringing you today's best of Charlie. Hope you enjoy

70
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,960
it's chock full of second-life stuff. So, well, at first I thought, uh, I'm really not interested in

71
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,120
hearing all that. But, you know, going back and listening to the enthusiasm is pretty interesting.

72
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,720
And thanks to the gofers, of course.

73
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:30,360
Hey, baby.

74
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,320
The source code listeners, this is happy again from bedtime stories. My kids love. And again,

75
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:43,080
I'm hosting a best of the Charlie while Adam moves to the new curry, shall I? Or like I said before,

76
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,360
whatever he wants to call it. Well, this episode, we're going to talk about something that Adam

77
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,640
really got into last year. Second life. And you're going to hear some of the best Adam Curry

78
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,920
second life moments on the daily source code. Listen up.

79
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,040
What is all this stuff? Ow! Watch out. Can you hear me? Can you learn how to fly?

80
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,920
Do I man? No guns. I'm running to the music. Right. The castle is closed.

81
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,280
I'm out of here.

82
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,320
It's crazy.

83
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:53,400
No, you're crazy. I think that's a Jeff's artistic way of saying, man, I kind of got

84
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,480
interested in sucked into that second life thing. You had a big fro. That was pretty cool.

85
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,320
But there are more people doing interesting things in second life, though.

86
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:12,840
Comics trip. Comics trip. Comics trip. Comics trip. Comics trip.

87
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,440
Hi, Adam Curry. Guess who I have met in person in second life yesterday?

88
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,560
It was Jeff Smith, who is making theme songs for Pat Castas for reasonable money.

89
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,600
We were chatting about making theme songs for me. And he mentioned that

90
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,680
his little daughter is running around the house and singing comics trip blogger,

91
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:46,920
comics trip blogger, Tim Song. Wow, that's scary, don't you think? So, speaking of second life,

92
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:56,120
Adam, matey, please meet Roger Smalls up. You both live in fucking gulfot. And he's now

93
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:04,840
sad and bitter because he has no credit card to join second life fun. So, please meet him in

94
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:15,000
R.L. known as real life and cheer him up. You. You. I've sent an email to Roger. I have

95
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,240
not heard back from him. I hope he's okay. It's very unlike him to be silent all this while. So,

96
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,840
let's just hope that he's okay. I don't think he was going on holiday. I mean, I just don't know.

97
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,320
I really don't know. But it's been weeks now since we've heard from him. So, I'm a bit concerned.

98
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,840
Maybe some problem with the draft and darts thing because he said he couldn't make that.

99
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,920
And that also didn't seem very Roger like. Maybe he was there after all. Maybe he'd actually

100
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,240
met me and thought what a dick. I don't want to send anything to him. So, but anyway,

101
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,000
that Roger smalls, I think he's tough at me. And we haven't heard from him for like three weeks now.

102
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,240
True. And he put this whole thing on his on his weblog that he can't well, he can't get on this,

103
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,760
he just he hates second life. Everything about it. He doesn't want to be part of it. And he

104
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,280
feels left out. And it's like, I don't know what to do. But he's not sending in any more stuff.

105
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:16,520
Well, there you go. You're losing friends, honey. Roger, come back. I'll do anything.

106
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:23,480
Yeah, please. Gaining of gaining friends in the air and in your second life, losing them in

107
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,760
RL. In real life, could you tell? Didn't I warn you about it?

108
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:41,960
Hello? Hey, Roger. Now, I'm at the go for home in second life. Yeah, yeah, it's pretty cool.

109
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,720
Hey, where are you been? It's been three weeks since we heard from you. Yeah, yeah.

110
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,040
Sincere. Yeah. Hey, Roger. My cell phone's ringing. I got to go.

111
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,520
Yeah, I changed my ringtone. I got to go. Yeah. I got to go. Bye.

112
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,920
Hey, CSP. Yeah, and be moved the bedtime story towers you can see curry castle. And now we have

113
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,600
a matching sun in a house. Yeah, it's pretty cool. A CSP don't forget to stop by the bedtime

114
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,760
stories. My kids love go for home in second life. Yeah, you can't miss this. We're right there

115
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:23,480
by where you live. Right by the tower. Remember CSP. Once you do go for, you never go for anything else.

116
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,680
Sorry about that. Just little go for humor. Hey, like I've shown the phone.

117
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,960
Check out this cool mashup. I got from the pod save music network.

118
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
Bro, am spécialating apparently.

119
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,040
What is that sound like you are playing this?

120
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,160
Yeah, of course.

121
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,560
So what are you doing?

122
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,040
Have I told you?

123
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,400
Yeah, I'm a party of Religion.

124
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Don't you think?

125
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,400
I am kidding!

126
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
You!

127
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
You!

128
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
You!

129
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
You!

130
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
You!

131
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Okay!

132
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Jeff Tinon, Tinon, excuse me.

133
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Sent me an email.

134
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,400
And I, you know, for a second there, I thought he might be right.

135
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Hello Adam.

136
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
I have a theory about Rogers absence of late.

137
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,400
We're talking about Roger Smalls, of course.

138
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
I actually think he's got himself a girlfriend.

139
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
And that's why he hasn't been in touch.

140
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,400
I have so many friends who had some point in other have gone quiet after

141
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
bagging a new squeeze.

142
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Leave it a month.

143
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,400
I'm sure he'll be back in touch once the novelty is worn off.

144
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
All the best from Jeff.

145
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Oops, and say, oh, excuse me.

146
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
I know that's disgusting, but I just needed to do that.

147
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Well, Jeff, funny enough, I think that your theory may be true,

148
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,400
because it has been almost exactly one month since we last heard from him.

149
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Hi Adam, Roger.

150
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
I'm sorry for not sending you any recordings for a while,

151
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
but I was very upset.

152
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
My comic suit blogger's Biblings.

153
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,400
He drew me in crayon on his website.

154
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Now, I'm not sure where he can't go like him as rats call me,

155
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
actually.

156
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I know I'm not actually buried head for anything when it comes to looks.

157
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,400
But let's just talk into some girls that go out drinking and go for it.

158
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Then he won't know how in the trashes I am.

159
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Now, if he's decided to do the same thing that he does,

160
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
and demand a public apology from him,

161
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
because I think as long as he's got hold of his ass,

162
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
he's going to continue to be spiteful and rude people.

163
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Which I don't think so any way to get on in life,

164
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
but it's all I've got to say for now, Adam.

165
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,400
I'm not saying another word and silly issues in apology.

166
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
So, by for now, Roger.

167
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
And while he's at stake,

168
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
he can apologize to Russell B.

169
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
He managed wine, steam,

170
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
and everyone else on your comments board too,

171
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
because he's a nasty piece of work.

172
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,400
But by the way, will you stop talking about that blessing

173
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
compete game?

174
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
I'm sure it's very working,

175
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,400
sat down and talked about space invaders for half an hour,

176
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
then he's losing all his audience.

177
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Now, when the people think hard casting is key,

178
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
the reason people listen to your shows

179
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,400
to hear how much pressure your life is compared to theirs,

180
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
not to talk about dungeons and dragons and high schools.

181
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
So I am so angry, I should go,

182
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
I just thought someone should tell you,

183
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
goodbye.

184
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Oh, Roger.

185
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
You say me my brother?

186
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Okay, so I do take this seriously.

187
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,400
It sounds like you're angry at comic strip blogger.

188
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
And now,

189
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,400
I think he actually, I think he's been pretty nice.

190
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
You know, he's said that he's given me advice

191
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,400
to do things to help you out.

192
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
You know, send you money,

193
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
so you could get on second life.

194
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Excuse me, I need to say

195
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
the virtual world,

196
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
second life,

197
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,400
where I am sometimes to be found at the curry castle.

198
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Anyway, it's good to hear your voice.

199
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
That's for sure.

200
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Let us know if it was a girlfriend that distracted you,

201
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
but if it was really just comic strip blogger

202
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
that made you so mad,

203
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
I think we need to,

204
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
we need to sit down and talk.

205
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
And you know what, Roger,

206
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
I would love to get you

207
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
into the second life virtual world

208
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
because I think that,

209
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
you know, you and comics are blogger.

210
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
You know, maybe you guys could meet on neutral ground,

211
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
you know, meet over at my place.

212
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
And let's talk this out.

213
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Okay,

214
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
because I don't like that.

215
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
You're the original stalker.

216
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
It's just what I call it.

218
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
It's a term of indierment.

219
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
You're the original stalker.

220
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
And,

221
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,400
please Roger,

222
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
please come back.

223
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I appreciate it.

224
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Nice to meet you.

225
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Come back anytime now.

226
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Comics strip.

227
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Comics strip.

228
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Comics strip.

229
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Comics strip.

230
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Comics strip.

231
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Comics strip.

232
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Comics strip.

233
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Comics strip.

234
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Controversy.

235
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Or should I say controversy?

236
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Between.

237
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Comics strip blogger and Roger Smalls.

238
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Now, we heard yesterday from Roger Smalls,

239
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
who is back.

240
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,400
That he was really, really upset with comics strip blogger.

241
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
And I saw on thecurry.com comments.

242
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,400
CSB had posted an entire apology.

243
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
And it doesn't stop there.

244
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
I don't carry.

245
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,400
I would like to apologize to Roger Smalls publicly.

246
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
That's true.

247
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,400
That I have drawn a comic strip where it was suggested

248
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,400
that Roger is not meeting up with you, Adam.

249
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
Carry.

250
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Because Roger is ugly and all shy.

251
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
I apologize for that.

252
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,400
And I have just removed the part of this comic strip

253
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
where Roger was featured.

254
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,400
I'll buy it as fictional character, called Roger

255
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Squalls.

256
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Not as Roger Smalls.

257
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Anyway, I was wrong.

258
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
You are one handsome hank Roger.

259
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
You are not ugly.

260
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
You are beautiful Roger.

261
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Okay.

262
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,400
So, dear Roger Smalls, please accept my apology.

263
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Sorry mate.

264
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Peace.

265
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Okay.

266
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Finally, anybody who is offended by any of my comic strips

267
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,400
or by any of my tabloid style writings,

268
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,400
please contact me directly.

269
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,400
And I will remove related pieces that are offending you.

270
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,400
I will accept, however, requests only from people

271
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,400
depicted, not from set parties.

272
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Originally of this, sometimes people like art

273
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,400
or publicity about themselves, no matter

274
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
whether it is good or bad.

275
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,400
According to the motto, there is no such thing as

276
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
bad publicity.

277
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
So, have a nice weekend, Adam.

278
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Carry.

279
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,400
I wish you sincerely a good health to your whole family.

280
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Show Adam.

281
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Bye.

282
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Yeah.

283
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,400
People say to me, what did you do to comic strip blogger?

284
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
You know what?

285
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
I just treated him like any other person who shows up

286
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
at the Daily Source Code front door.

287
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
And low and behold, there is a pretty nice

288
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,400
intelligent guy underneath all that rough exterior.

289
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Now, unfortunately, Roger hasn't heard

290
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,400
this public apology because he sent me something

291
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,400
this morning before I did the show.

292
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,400
So, he may have changed his feelings about you.

293
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,400
There's CSB after what he just heard.

294
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,400
But as of this morning, he was definitely

295
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
definitely not pleased.

296
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Let's listen.

297
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Hey, I didn't Roger here.

298
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
I heard that one of your listeners mentioned

299
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
on last week's show that's international

300
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
masturbation months for the moment.

301
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Now, I'm not sure how this works.

302
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Does it mean I get to enjoy myself for this month,

303
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
but then have to wait 11 months before I get to

304
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
squirt my care again.

305
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Can you explain?

306
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
What did you say?

307
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Wait 11 months until what?

308
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
How for this month?

309
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
But then have to wait 11 months

310
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
before I get to squirt my care again.

311
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Oh, Roger.

312
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Did you actually say squirt my curd?

313
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Can you explain this, please?

314
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Thank you.

315
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Oh.

316
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
You want to say put the send you some songs

317
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,400
in about masturbation and I found something.

318
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Hey.

319
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
You know, I think there was a,

320
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
wasn't there a piece about comics crew?

321
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Is this yesterday's piece?

322
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
I don't know what they had I'm doing.

323
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Now I'm all confused.

324
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Hold on.

325
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Is this still the masturbation?

326
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
How about a white coat?

327
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
How about a white coat?

328
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
How about a white coat?

329
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
That's the same thing.

330
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
That's the song about wanking.

331
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
This is the one he sent me.

332
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
That's right.

333
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,400
If there's one person who knows about easing the lonelyness of an empty life,

334
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
you can't even remember magazine.

335
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Then it's the comic strip blogger.

336
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
I don't think it's international masturbation

337
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
month with him now.

338
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
I think it's more like international masturbation

339
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
52 years.

340
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Because I think that guy's been a tusso roll is like.

341
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm sorry to say.

342
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
It's also like the man.

343
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Don't agree with his policies or creed.

344
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,400
By for now and happy masturbating.

345
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I noticed yesterday when looking through that,

346
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,400
that I had a much clearer vision of what we could do with the house

347
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
than previously.

348
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Big eyes.

349
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
And you're going to laugh at me when I say this?

350
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Oh, not again.

351
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
It's true.

352
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Because we're building stuff in second life.

353
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
But isn't it the way they actually do Architex and everything work

354
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,400
when they build houses?

355
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Well, yeah.

356
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
You can walk through that.

357
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Yeah.

358
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
So this is very, very similar.

359
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
And so I'm looking down like, hmm,

360
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,400
we could just chop this wall in half and round it off like that.

361
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,400
And I find myself almost wanting to move my mouse finger to click

362
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,400
and you know, and to move the wall.

363
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Oh, yeah.

364
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Yeah.

365
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
That's what they do.

366
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Yeah.

367
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
When they make a designer or something,

368
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
they do that.

369
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
You can walk through the house before it's done.

370
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
But it's really affected me.

371
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
I'm not making, I'm not making it.

372
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
I believe you.

373
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
It's really affected me.

374
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Or maybe if we find somebody who can do that.

375
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Exactly.

376
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
In second life.

377
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
In second life.

378
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
In real life.

379
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
We can see what you can do with the house.

380
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Yeah.

381
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
So that's what we're going to try to do.

382
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,400
We're thinking about and see what the, the very cool.

383
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Yeah.

384
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Building things with two different women at the same time.

385
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Oh.

386
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Yeah.

387
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I'm building the Potio Palace with Brittany, remember?

388
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Oh, yeah.

389
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Brittany.

390
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
No, not Brittany.

391
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Brittany.

392
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
I say that.

393
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
But that's incorrect.

394
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Yeah.

395
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
I know a Brittany.

396
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
But just Brittany.

397
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
There's no A and.

398
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
No Brittany.

399
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
It's Brittany.

400
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Oh.

401
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Okay.

402
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Brittany.

403
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Yeah.

404
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
I know.

405
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
What is that?

406
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
A lot of time with Brittany.

407
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
No.

408
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Yes, you do.

409
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
But it's going to be very cool when it's long as you have fun.

410
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Oh, God.

411
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
I love you so much.

412
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Do you know how many guys are listening to this now going like.

413
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Like, listen.

414
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Why don't I get me one of those?

415
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Yeah.

416
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,400
It's nice to see that your husband is busy.

417
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
That's true.

418
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Not sitting around.

419
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
So he can't.

420
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
He can't.

421
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
He can't.

422
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Or do I ever nag you in the way?

423
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Oh, okay.

424
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Yes.

425
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
I'm often often in the way.

426
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,400
By the way, there's not a day goes by that I don't get 20 emails.

427
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,400
At least of people looking for the castle.

428
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,400
So I for some reason I got delisted off of find.

429
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
I'll put it back in again.

430
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
You should be able to find it.

431
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,400
I'm going to move the whole place today onto right in the middle of four plots.

432
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Which I've been able to thank you very much.

433
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Gabrielle.

434
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Real for letting me buy your land.

435
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,400
So now I have enough to really because you have all these limitations.

436
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Of how many prims, what they call them, you can put on to a piece of land.

437
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,400
So if I'm covering four, then all four corners will count in a different land.

438
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,400
And I think you can actually combine all the land together.

439
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,400
So all I want is just to have more more place to put stuff down.

440
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
So we can have more fun.

441
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
What's up, baby?

442
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
I was listening.

443
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,400
And I thought I think you need to explain every time and over and over that you are not talking about real life.

444
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
I said second life.

445
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Oh yeah, but do people know maybe new listeners.

446
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Hey.

447
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
What did it?

448
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Excuse me.

449
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
And entertainment expert.

450
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Okay.

451
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
The hell is that?

452
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Well, because you're talking about plots and buying plots and I think buying plots.

453
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,400
People who listen to the show either understand.

454
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
And what if you have new listeners?

455
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Do you want to produce the fucking show?

456
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
No.

457
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Okay.

458
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Well, I appreciate it.

459
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,400
But that would be like me coming in and saying, I think you should do that in sea instead of

460
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
D. This is my art.

461
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I don't care.

462
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Okay.

463
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
I was curious.

464
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Now I understand what you're saying, but I can't reintroduce every single topic that we discuss.

465
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
No, no.

466
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
No, come back here, please.

467
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Yeah.

468
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
In front of the microphone where people can hear you.

469
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Yes.

470
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
I understand what you're saying.

471
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
But first of all, people aren't stupid.

472
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Don't underestimate my listeners.

473
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
The figure.

474
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Does it have a name?

475
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
The whole thing.

476
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Not only second life.

477
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,400
But when we talk about things, I don't go back and explain everything all the time.

478
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,400
I mean, some things weren't re-explanation.

479
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
But this has been on the cover of business.

480
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
We people have heard about second life.

481
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
If not, they're going to look for it.

482
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
That's how it works.

483
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
All right.

484
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Okay.

485
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Okay.

486
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
And if you ever wanted to disturb the man behind the curtain again.

487
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Oh, you called me too in the middle of something.

488
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Doesn't matter, does it?

489
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
No, no.

490
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
But I'm sure.

491
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,400
That's why we're married for 20 years this year.

492
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Part of, but part of it is, if I go back into explaining what it is.

493
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,400
No, not explaining, but saying real fast, oh, I'm going to talk about it.

494
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Second life.

495
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Well, they call them virtual worlds.

496
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
But there you go.

497
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
That's what I mean.

498
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
All right.

499
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Yeah?

500
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
No?

501
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Okay.

502
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Okay.

503
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
Bye-bye.

504
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,400
This is worse than the guy that Howard Stern had to deal with.

505
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,400
He went to go WMBC.

506
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
I guess you stopped listening to me.

507
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
I don't know what I was saying.

508
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Oh, I see how it is.

509
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
I go away for a week.

510
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
I'm locked out of curry castle.

511
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
This is Angie.

512
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Just in case you forgot.

513
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Hmm.

514
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,400
See if you get any blow jobs from this avatar.

515
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Angie?

516
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Angie?

517
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,400
This is all a virtual world stuff we're talking about, of course.

518
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Now, actually, I tried to find you because I'd love to have you be one of our first showcases

519
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
in the palace.

520
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,400
And I think I've got all the technology bits figured out.

521
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Of course, what we need is a live.

522
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,400
I will not say a live live performance, but a live recording of a live performance or something

523
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
like that.

524
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,400
And I'm just messing around with all kinds of permissions and learning myself.

525
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,400
And you've only been in this virtual world for two weeks.

526
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Don't get all pissed off with me now.

527
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Please.

528
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Please.

529
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
And she lives.

530
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
She has a beautiful man.

531
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
I gotta tell you.

532
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I am so beyond that for myself.

533
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Oh, yeah.

534
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Then why are you building castles in second life?

535
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Well, to accommodate.

536
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Why are you castles?

537
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Well, why just because I like what a castle looks like.

538
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
Why not a bunker?

539
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,400
For exactly the way you just said a bunker.

540
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,400
And besides, curry bunker does not have the same cachet as curry castle.

541
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,400
So what I mean is everybody would like to have their own castle.

542
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Let me just say, well, we've had a castle.

543
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
And I miss it still very much.

544
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Yeah.

545
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
That's part of it.

546
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Because the castle I'm building in second life is a great place for entertaining.

547
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Oh, okay.

548
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Yeah.

549
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Okay.

550
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
You want to get into second life now?

551
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
You want to talk about that?

552
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Although, you know, I see that it's.

553
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Very, very interesting and it's brilliant.

554
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,400
And I see it as a game.

555
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
But I don't see it.

556
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
You don't see the purpose of it?

557
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
No.

558
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,400
I mean, people can hardly deal with the first life.

559
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,400
And now they escaped to, they want to escape to second life.

560
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,400
And then, and then probably somebody that they're not.

561
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:37,400
And then, probably be a girl a chick with big boobs and a very extremely high heels.

562
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Have you seen me in second life?

563
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Are you the girl with big boobs?

564
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
No.

565
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
No.

566
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
And I've seen you.

567
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
So everybody's good.

568
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Of course.

569
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Somebody that they actually are not.

570
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Well, you, you can.

571
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Is that the fantasy?

572
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Well, did you, well, first of all, let's just step back.

573
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,400
And then the girl with the big boobs and the extremely high heels.

574
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Yes, exactly.

575
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,400
And all the girls in all the girls in second life who look anything like you.

576
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
I immediately have a crush on.

577
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
The only thing is they're about six feet tall.

578
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,400
And if you were in second life, if you were in second life, what would the, the only thing

579
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,400
you change about yourself is you make yourself taller.

580
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Right.

581
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
True or not?

582
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Yeah.

583
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Okay.

584
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Now, let me just step back for a second because I said this to you last night.

585
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,400
You said, who has, in fact, you, you did want a real Patricia.

586
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Who has time for this?

587
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Really?

588
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
And I said, this is.

589
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,400
People have hardly time for each other.

590
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
No.

591
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
No.

592
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Before we get into that, let me just step back.

593
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
It's replacing television time.

594
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,400
It's replacing all that other time that is spent on other entertainment.

595
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
I don't think that it's in addition.

596
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,400
You know, so we spend time on the TV.

597
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Have we watched television together?

598
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,400
Well, daily source co- listeners, we sure had a bunch of adventures in second life.

599
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,400
This past year on the daily source code.

600
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,400
And Adam sure had some interesting things to say with Patricia.

601
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,400
But trust me, Adam, I've seen you in second life.

602
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
And you don't look that way.

603
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Well, everybody, this is happy from bedtime stories.
