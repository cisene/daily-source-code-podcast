00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
It's the DSC-622 and it's time to play where in the world is Adam Curry.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,560
And it's time to get the food bar out of the closet, because it's blue bar bright.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:32,360
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
will bring you content in my ears.

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,360
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

6
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:14,360
He got a nice pick, that made his ears burn, whatever happens to you, do a blend there,

7
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:39,360
to play on me right, and a central pencil, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you are the heroes,

8
00:01:39,360 --> 00:02:05,360
whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, no more heroes anymore, no more heroes anymore.

9
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:39,360
I like to think I'm flying you to the future, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever

00:02:39,360 --> 00:03:09,360
happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens

11
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:31,980
to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you to come up here, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens, you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you, whatever happens to you

12
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,980
No more heroes anymore.

13
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,980
No more heroes.

14
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,980
Sure, these days have got your email.

15
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,980
You've always got your rockin' long.

16
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,980
But 30 years ago, this was the sound of the underground,

17
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,980
the organization for preservation

18
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,980
to the soundtrack of our lives presents

19
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,980
the Fubar Friday maximum music spectacular

20
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,980
to other stranglers.

21
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,980
No more heroes anymore.

22
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,980
There's more stranglers than I could do.

23
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,980
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,980
You sure are a pretty man at him.

25
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,980
If I was woman, I'd have put him for you.

26
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,980
Oh, I got so much to talk about.

27
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,980
What an incredible week.

28
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,980
And I am neckerd.

29
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:49,980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

30
00:04:49,980 --> 00:05:19,980
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

31
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,980
You made me know I'm sure

32
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,980
You can't completely love me so fast

33
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,980
Gonna give it more

34
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,980
You won't ever make it just a set

35
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,980
You made me do any job

36
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,980
Baby, don't watch your own

37
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,980
I'll say I'll kill someone

38
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,980
But I didn't stop it

39
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,980
I decided you wanted to win

40
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,980
Baby, I don't want nobody

41
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,980
That's not me

42
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,980
I am not gonna eyes

43
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,980
I am alone

44
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,980
Gotta hear what I see

45
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,980
When the heavey

46
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,980
It's a cruise or a live, you're the best thing I've ever seen.

47
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,980
Oh, you're my favorite.

48
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,980
Show me how.

49
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,980
Deep within the feelings you're dreaming of.

50
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,980
Little brother, say you're just fine.

51
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,980
Break it through and eat your baby.

52
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
I want you all the time.

53
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,980
Say it up to you, say it up to you, say it up to you.

54
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,980
I do this way.

55
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,980
Cause I don't wanna do it.

56
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,980
Baby, I don't want nobody else.

57
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,980
Deep within the feelings you're dreaming of.

58
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,980
Deep within the feelings you're dreaming of.

59
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,980
It's a cruise or a live, you're the best thing I've ever seen.

60
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Break it through and eat your baby.

61
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,980
Show me how.

62
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,980
Deep within the feelings you're dreaming of.

63
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,980
Little brother, say it up to you, say it up to you.

64
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,980
All right, it's just fine.

65
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,980
All together now.

66
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,980
You got to do the source code check.

67
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,980
10, 10, 1, 2, 1, 2, check.

68
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
Check.

69
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,980
10, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3.

70
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,980
Lock down.

71
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,980
It's brand new in the Pods and Music Network.

72
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,980
Actually, a couple of weeks now.

73
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,980
It's called Babe.

74
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,980
I like that sound.

75
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,980
I like what those wacky kids have done.

76
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,980
You can find links to that in the show.

77
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,980
It's a daily source code dot com.

78
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,980
Hello, everybody.

79
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,980
Welcome to DSC 622.

80
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gilford on the west side of

81
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
G town is where you will find the manner.

82
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,980
Man, it's like I've been on the road for three weeks straight now with what

83
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,980
like two days at home.

84
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,980
I'm back from Khan, everybody.

85
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,980
And I really apologize profusely.

86
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:02,980
Well, first of all, I apologize profusely for episode 62620.

87
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,980
Obviously, you all noticed something went wrong.

88
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,980
I was back from, what was it?

89
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,980
Back from San Francisco, New York and Washington, DC.

90
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,980
And I just couldn't get the sound right.

91
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,980
It's something, you know, I don't know if my ears had changed.

92
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,980
Maybe they were still clogged up from flying it to a tremendous altitude.

93
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,980
But it just didn't sound right.

94
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,980
So I decided to test it.

95
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,980
You can only really test it when you're recording it and can listen back to it.

96
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,980
And I just kind of forgot to reset the recording on Casplaster.

97
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,980
So for those of you who are surprised by 15 minutes of me going test test one two.

98
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,980
Check, check, test one two.

99
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,980
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,980
He said check, check, check.

101
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,980
Oh man, I'm not going to rag you.

102
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,980
I'm not.

103
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,980
I'm letting you get so much shit.

104
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,980
I bet you got so much shit.

105
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,980
But it's not me.

106
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,980
You just give me sound the best laugh ever.

107
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
I look like a right person on the tube.

108
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
Can you see myself laughing?

109
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,980
So what comes off the three?

110
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
One two.

111
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
Charles.

112
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,980
Oh, I love you, Miss Curry.

113
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,980
I love you too.

114
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,980
And I mean it.

115
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,980
All right, Charles, the drunk and London are checking in.

116
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,980
He heard it too.

117
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,980
And apparently he cracked up on the tube, which is English for a subway.

118
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Hey, so this, this country was interesting.

119
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,980
Hopefully you saw episode 621.

120
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,980
I guess it is an official episode 621.

121
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,980
Where I recorded some of the flight down to Khan.

122
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,980
I've pretty much told you all I could about that.

123
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,980
The trip back, by the way, was equally spectacular.

124
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,980
Leaving a monthly airport.

125
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,980
We went straight to flight level 65 from 65 straight to flight level 105,

126
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,980
which is, so about 10 and a half thousand feet.

127
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,980
And we were above the clouds.

128
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,980
It was, it was the most awesome flight.

129
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,980
I've, well, it was the, I don't know, it was, it was up there with the, with the trip over over to Khan, I guess.

130
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,980
But something, some other interesting and exciting things happened, which I'll just share with you very briefly.

131
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,980
The, we can't climb much higher than 10,000 feet without oxygen.

132
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,980
If you, in fact, the rule is you can be at 12,000 feet, but for no longer than 30 minutes.

133
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,980
And even then you still got to kind of look at each other.

134
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,980
Make sure you're not turning blue.

135
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,980
And the clouds all of a sudden start to rise above 10 and a half thousand feet.

136
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,980
We went through the top layer and we figured, well, we'll, we'll see what's on the other side of it.

137
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,980
If it, it might go down or it might go up.

138
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,980
It's hard to see.

139
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,980
You know, when you're to only at 10,000 feet.

140
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,980
But of course, at that flight level, the temperatures are freezing.

141
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,980
You go through the cloud and you build up ice.

142
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,980
So through the first, first bunch of tops of the clouds there, we had some ice build up.

143
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,980
And we requested flight level 12, one, two, five.

144
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,980
No, one, one, five.

145
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,980
And that still wasn't high enough.

146
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
And ice was building up pretty rapidly.

147
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,980
So we, we have down all the way down to.

148
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,980
Believe it or not, below three, that was like two and a half thousand feet.

149
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,980
That's how far we went down before we were out of the cloud.

150
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,980
And then we found ourselves in a restricted area, which I knew was there.

151
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
And you can request across the restricted area.

152
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,980
But these were like active, gunnery areas and the French military practice bases.

153
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,980
Which we could traverse if we were no more than 800 feet above ground level.

154
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,980
Otherwise, you have the, the chance of getting it.

155
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,980
Like, what's it?

156
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,980
Where do they fly there?

157
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
Mirages?

158
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
Mirage?

159
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Or maybe it's F-16s.

160
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,980
I don't know.

161
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,980
You could get one of those up your ass.

162
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,980
And the weather was pretty crappy.

163
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,980
But landed at Antwerp, no problem after relatively short flight.

164
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,980
Only three hours from Conta to Antwerp.

165
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,980
And refueled.

166
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,980
And then I set off back to, back to Farrogues by myself.

167
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,980
Which really seemed like no big deal at all.

168
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,980
And you know, I've been flying so much lately.

169
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,980
So flying wise, great success.

170
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,980
Really, really had a fantastic time.

171
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,980
Can't wait to explore other farlands and meet children from other countries.

172
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,980
But it's confessible.

173
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,980
Now, this is something else.

174
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:11,980
This is a 12,000 advertising industry people descend upon the south of France.

175
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,980
I should have said false.

176
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,980
To talk about advertising.

177
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,980
Now, there's two things that really, the number one topic was very interesting to me.

178
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,980
And it really has the advertising world running quite scared.

179
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,980
And this really has nothing to do with our business.

180
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,980
This is more Google's business.

181
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,980
So it's a banners and ad cents.

182
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,980
You know, really click advertising, if you will.

183
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,980
Which, in my opinion, has nothing to do with brand advertising, but that's another story.

184
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,980
So now that Google has made the acquisition of what is a double click,

185
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,980
and 24, seven has been acquired.

186
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,980
So basically, you know, Microsoft Yahoo and Google, they all have these ad networks now.

187
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,980
And they are selling what they're buying.

188
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,980
It's kind of hard to explain, but they basically can go by inventory from themselves

189
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,980
and determine their own prices.

190
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,980
It's, you know, so the, in effect, cutting out the middle man being the media buyers.

191
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,980
So there was a lot of talk about that quite boring from my perspective.

192
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,980
But I did sit on a panel with, which was organized by Sean Finigan of OMD,

193
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
which is an agency in New York.

194
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,980
And we've done a lot of work with OMD and with Sean personally.

195
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,980
So I'm happy to oblige, of course.

196
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,980
This is the, you know, by this is how the advertising industry works.

197
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,980
You know, we all suck up each to, you know, suck up to each other as much as possible.

198
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,980
On this panel were a couple of the people, including as he was a guy from a Google

199
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,980
France, and there was a guy from juice.

200
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,980
France, I think.

201
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,980
No juice. He was from, I can't remember where he was from.

202
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,980
He was, he was like a, you know, like a director type guy.

203
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,980
I'm not quite sure what he was doing.

204
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,980
So then I don't know if they had a lot to say, the Google guy was, man,

205
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,980
those guys are walking like it's like they got 10 foot dicks.

206
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,980
Which I guess he can do.

207
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,980
But I sat next to when the miller.

208
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,980
And she is the chief sales officer at Yahoo.

209
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,980
And now we had, we really got into it with the other sparks were flying.

210
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,980
It was fun.

211
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,980
You know, she was talking about all this great information.

212
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,980
They had about about their users.

213
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,980
And I said, well, why don't you keep calling your audience users?

214
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,980
It doesn't sound very friendly unless you're a drug dealer.

215
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,980
And then I said, well, look at the end of the day, you're selling like banners.

216
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,980
You know, when is the last time someone called up an advertiser and said,

217
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,980
oh, man, thank you so much.

218
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,980
I clicked on that banner and it felt so incredibly good.

219
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,980
What a great experience.

220
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Can't wait to click on another banner.

221
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,980
You know, and what I was trying to point out was that the advertising that we do

222
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,980
in our shows is a lot more fun.

223
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,980
At least I think so.

224
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,980
Anyway, so I'm sitting there.

225
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,980
I'm there with 12,000 advertising industry geeks.

226
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,980
It was all by myself.

227
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,980
No backup from HQ.

228
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,980
And you know, so I had to attend dinners.

229
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,980
And which I want to talk about later this one particular dinner and the conversation

230
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,980
I had with a couple folks, including Linda.

231
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,980
And what else was there?

232
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,980
Well, there's the infamous gutter bar.

233
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,980
So you have to go drink at the gutter bar, which is called the gutter bar,

234
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,980
because it's so many people go there.

235
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,980
It spills out into the streets and essentially the gutter.

236
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,980
So you can imagine that it was lonely.

237
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,980
It was just me in 12,000 geeks.

238
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,980
And the Wi-Fi was crappy.

239
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,980
And it was hot during the day, which one hand was nice.

240
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,980
But you know, it wasn't like I walk around in shorts.

241
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,980
Not that that's a very good look on me anyway.

242
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,980
And then all of a sudden, through the crappy Wi-Fi,

243
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,980
I see a shimmering twinkling light.

244
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,980
And it's a love message from soccer girl.

245
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Hey Adam, this is soccer girl.

246
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,980
I wanted to thank you for being so nice about me and my show on your show.

247
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,980
I'm so totally excited that you showed my boobs to Hollywood.

248
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,980
It's so awesome. I'm totally psyched.

249
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,980
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

250
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,980
I didn't show your boobs to Hollywood.

251
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,980
In fact, they were, no, no, no, no, no, no.

252
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,980
I would keep those to myself.

253
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,980
No, I just said screw lonely girl 15.

254
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,980
This is the real deal.

255
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Now, if they had watched the whole video all the way through,

256
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,980
of course, you know, all the way to the end,

257
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,980
you're two short stories.

258
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,980
And they would have seen, they would have seen the,

259
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,980
the, the mounds of the light.

260
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,980
So I don't know if they did that after we left the room.

261
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,980
But it was really just to accentuate.

262
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,980
They just looked at you after the burger came off.

263
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,980
And they went, wow.

264
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,980
I said indeed, that is soccer girl.

265
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,980
Except the only thing is that they're getting kind of

266
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,980
egotistical about it.

267
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,980
And, you know, it's like I'm so happy for them.

268
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,980
But they're totally rubbing it in.

269
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,980
I mean, you know, it's like hand out the be balls.

270
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,980
Let's get some throw yo celebrate, whatever.

271
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,980
But making me get hookers to snort cocaine off you.

272
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,980
She's kind of like,

273
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,980
it's kind of like, uh, drink them through.

274
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,980
I mean, don't you think I want to snort cocaine off of you?

275
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,980
Just makes me feel really bad.

276
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
Now I'm too upset to even continue this.

277
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,980
Thank you.

278
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,980
I hope you're happy.

279
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,980
Fuckin' boobs.

280
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,980
I'm sorry, Adam.

281
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,980
This isn't working.

282
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,980
I better try song.

283
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,980
Yo, Charlie.

284
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,980
Um, yeah, I think this one's for you.

285
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,980
You got a blaster ray on the brain.

286
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,980
It's a taste.

287
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,980
Won't get jay with me.

288
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,980
Teach I may seem a name.

289
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,980
Stratacaster cats are passing plants.

290
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,980
That you're adorable way free.

291
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,980
So many ways.

292
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,980
You want to make me.

293
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,980
Mr. Pod, father.

294
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,980
Girls want paint cars and not just daughters.

295
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,980
Also soccer.

296
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,980
You know, I'm kidding.

297
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,980
What are they like?

298
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
No, yeah.

299
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,980
Maybe.

300
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,980
Don't pony's in the moon.

301
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,980
Let me come fight.

302
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,980
Bring a pickle through a party.

303
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,980
Holden tie.

304
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
Curry curry.

305
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,980
That's a spicy attack.

306
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Don't worry, Curry.

307
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
You know, I got your back.

308
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,980
This is the information that you don't yet have.

309
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,980
The trace amounts of semen and the evidence bag.

310
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,980
In this brigalogy season for being alive.

311
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,980
I'm a 30-style boxer with my lyrics aligned.

312
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,980
You're a hot potato cookie.

313
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,980
If it really is a win, can we get up to a drink over a soccer building?

314
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,980
Okay.

315
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,980
Thanks, Adam.

316
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,980
Love soccer, girl.

317
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,980
Oh, mean it.

318
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
Oh, yeah.

319
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,980
So you understand that I felt much better after that.

320
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
And then, of course, I got a call from Mark Yoshimaru,

321
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,980
Namcoff, and it ruined the entire vibe.

322
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,980
And I'll talk about him on Monday.

323
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,980
Let's see.

324
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
Yeah.

325
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,980
So it was all right.

326
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,980
It was one day too long, basically.

327
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
But otherwise, yeah.

328
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,980
And I think next year, I don't know.

329
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,980
I think business will come out of it, actually.

330
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,980
It should be interesting to see.

331
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,980
One thing was a little hard in France.

332
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,980
And in the South of France, everybody is fucking smoking everywhere.

333
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,980
Because you can, I think.

334
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,980
So I got to say, come July 1st when the smoking band rolls around

335
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,980
into the United Kingdom, I'm all for it.

336
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980
It's hard enough, as is.

337
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,980
But then everybody just lighten up, you know, after a nice meal with some wine,

338
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,980
and then a drinking port, and then a smoking away.

339
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
Hi, Adam.

340
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:57,980
This is Andy from Guy Laplaba, and the German show about something.

341
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,980
I just wanted to say, you know, that you're not alone.

342
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,980
I also stopped smoking some weeks ago, and I have to, almost the same problems

343
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,980
in you, do.

344
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,980
Just listen to the following pre-compiles snippets of our last show,

345
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,980
and you will know what I mean, I guess.

346
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,980
And then you scream at me.

347
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,980
You had it at the end of the year, 360 gram.

348
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,980
And I'll start with the second one.

349
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
I'll wrangle you as well.

350
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,980
I'll burn you.

351
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,980
I'll burn you.

352
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,980
I'll burn you.

353
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,980
I'll burn you.

354
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,980
I'll burn you.

355
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
I'll burn you.

356
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
I'll burn you.

357
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,980
I'll burn you.

358
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,980
I'll burn you.

359
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,980
I'll burn you.

360
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,980
I'll burn you.

361
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,980
...

362
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,980
I'll burn you.

363
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,980
You're saying something like this?

364
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,980
I'll burn you.

365
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,980
What can I say?

366
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,980
I'll burn you.

367
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,980
I'll burn you.

368
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,980
I'm burning you.

369
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,980
I'll burn you.

370
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,980
I'm burning you.

371
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,980
I'm burning you.

372
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,980
So I like to be in my Wells Auto.

373
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,980
Working hard to get rid of the shit of the last 50 years of smoking,

374
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,980
I hope this is not going to last full next month.

375
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:12,820
for the next, I don't know, year or so. Keep up the good work. Welcome to Germany.

376
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,900
Folder. Yeah, don't care. Well, not quite in Germany yet. We got a lot of work to do still,

377
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:28,100
but we're working very, very hard on it. Man, I thought it was 15 years. Actually, I've been

378
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,620
smoking 25 years. Can you believe? Can you imagine what damage I've already done to, not just

379
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:40,900
my lungs with my heart, crap. And, and I'm glad that for these past three weeks and really

380
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,700
glad that it's been three weeks, it's been more than three weeks, hasn't it? I'm happy, man,

381
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,380
because geez, Louise, I don't think I'd be able to make it through. What have we done?

382
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,700
I remember so well, only two and a half years ago. Hey, yeah, man, come on. We could totally do this. I know

383
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:03,380
we can create a whole new media industry. It'll be fun. And it is fun, but crap, we forgot how much

384
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,820
work it was. This week's hit test for the second week in a row is brought to you by Coca-Cola.

385
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:16,420
This summer, when you buy Coke, you get music. You can win an iPod or free songs on iTunes.

386
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:23,060
One girl in casting with Adam Curry. Hey, Adam, are you ready to be stumps?

387
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:30,340
Oh yeah, good. He's the one who picked it up with young pro back. Hey, Adam, this is a hit test number

388
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:36,260
75th right fourth in a row now on the daily source code. Yep. So I'm very anxious to know how things are

389
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,860
going to develop in the near future. So if you know more, be sure to let me know, okay? I want

390
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,660
short clips in the fourth three answer. So here we go. This is the number one.

391
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:56,100
Oh, please, please, please. It's a bright Adam's Tina Turner. It's only love. And that's all. How could you

392
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,540
and everybody knows that intro? Don't think? And number two.

393
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:11,300
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you know, the one on the sailboat.

394
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,140
And the final one.

395
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:13,780
But...

396
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,540
Again?

397
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:24,660
I'm going to say that was uh, uh, uh, was it building a bridge to my heart? Uh, godly and queen?

398
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,380
And again, they were pretty easy. So let's go to the answers right away. This is one.

399
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,540
All right, from 1985, Brian Adams and Tina Turner.

400
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,540
And Tony Love.

401
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,540
Oh, I feel you said it.

402
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,540
There ain't no secret to you.

403
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,540
Go to work.

404
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,540
And it's Tony Love.

405
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,540
Yes.

406
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,540
Hey, you better go now.

407
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
Oh, man.

408
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
Oh, man.

409
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,540
Oh, man.

410
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,540
That takes me back, y'all.

411
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
Tony Love.

412
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,540
It's Tony Love.

413
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
And that's all.

414
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,540
Adam's in turn and it's Tony Love.

415
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,540
And this is from 85 as well.

416
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,540
Durand, Durand.

417
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,540
You saw me standing.

418
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,540
Yeah, but what's the title?

419
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,540
I got, it's on the sailboat, right?

420
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Thanks, Jimmy.

421
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,540
Don't say the proud of all of me now.

422
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,540
Sit, say the prayer.

423
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,540
Save it till the morning after.

424
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:30,540
I think I could vote points for number two.

425
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,540
Durand, Durand, and save a crack.

426
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,540
And this is answer number three.

427
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,540
Yeah.

428
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,540
And it's all wrong.

429
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,540
I'm losing sleep.

430
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,540
And look at what you say.

431
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

432
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:56,540
From 1987, and so number three in this week's hit list.

433
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,540
Wakes and building a bridge through your hearts.

434
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,540
And listen for this week.

435
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,540
Hope you did well, Adam.

436
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
They're a pretty easy game.

437
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,540
I think I got three, three, four points.

438
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,540
So please let me know how things will develop and will continue in the near future.

439
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,540
Hope you'd like the clips I used in this hit list.

440
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,540
So until next time, take care.

441
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,540
I'm for a Drex, and I tuned links.

442
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,540
Check hit test.pachel.com, all right?

443
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Okay, until next time, bye-bye.

444
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,540
Be back.

445
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,540
Hit test at gmail.com.

446
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,540
www.gmail.com

447
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,540
www.gmail.com

448
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,540
www.gmail.com

449
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,540
You are a magician, my friend.

450
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
Now what are you kind of here, Jon, refer into it.

451
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,540
I said that we do a four week trial,

452
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,540
bringing back the hit test under the

453
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:51,540
Fair use policy because of course the hit test is a production of the organization for preservation for the soundtrack of our lives.

454
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,540
You never hear this shit on the radio anymore.

455
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,540
So we might as well at least remind you of what it sounded like,

456
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,540
even though we can't play full tracks.

457
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,540
And of course, if you go to hittest.podge.com,

458
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:10,540
you can find all of the original hit test files and links to the iTunes music store where you can buy the songs that are featured.

459
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,540
So does it get any better than that?

460
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,540
I don't think so.

461
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,540
And yes, Jon, we will be continuing.

462
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,540
As you can tell, sponsors have really picked up on the whole idea of the hit test.

463
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
They love it.

464
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,540
Coke two weeks in a row now.

465
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,540
So, Jon, don't quit the day job yet.

466
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,540
But my friend, we've got ourselves a gig.

467
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:40,540
I was afraid, I was petrified.

468
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:49,540
Can't think he might have could never leave without you boss.

469
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:59,540
But I spent so many nights just thinking how you did the role.

470
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,540
And I grew strong.

471
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:17,540
And I learned how to get along.

472
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,540
And so you're back.

473
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,540
From that is based.

474
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,540
I just was in the vine here.

475
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,540
When I said look upon your face,

476
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,540
I should have changed my stupid luck.

477
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,540
Maybe you keep it by and don't but just one second.

478
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,540
You be back to bother me.

479
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,540
Go on level.

480
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,540
Walk out the door.

481
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,540
Just turn around now.

482
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,540
Cause you're not welcome anymore.

483
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,540
Where to the one who tried to hurt me with.

484
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,540
Good bye.

485
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
And you think I grew more and more.

486
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,540
The thing was late.

487
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,540
I didn't lie.

488
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,540
I don't know that.

489
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,540
I will survive.

490
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,540
Whoa, as long as I know how to love.

491
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,540
I don't want to see you like.

492
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,540
Cause I've got a moment to live.

493
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,540
And I've got a moment to get and I'll survive.

494
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,540
I'll survive.

495
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,540
It took all the time.

496
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,540
I have enough to follow up.

497
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,540
Get time on the pieces of the wrong.

498
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,540
But I spent so many nights just thinking how you did the role.

499
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,540
And I said I don't cry.

500
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,540
But now I hold my head up high and you see me.

501
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,540
Somebody need me.

502
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,540
I'm up that chain of little persons in and all with you.

503
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,540
When so you felt like dropping in.

504
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,540
I just expect me to be free.

505
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,540
But now I say they know my love.

506
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,540
And of course I'm one who's all in me.

507
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,540
Go on level.

508
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
Walk out the door.

509
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,540
Just turn around now.

510
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,540
Cause you're not welcome anymore.

511
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,540
Where to the one who tried to break me with.

512
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
Good bye.

513
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,540
You think I grew more and more.

514
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,540
The thing I laid out and now you know that.

515
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,540
I'm the one who's all right.

516
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,540
Oh, it's all because I know I'm not alone.

517
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,540
I feel like it's all because I'm alone.

518
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,540
But I've to live and I've got to live.

519
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,540
I've to keep and I'm so right.

520
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,540
I will survive.

521
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:49,540
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

522
00:29:49,540 --> 00:30:07,740
eeeeeeeoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

523
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:29,020
but I love to love.

524
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,780
You know I love stuff like that you know it sounds a lot like not only does it sound like

525
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,400
the list of his bitties or the type of cocktail pop music they would do but of course

526
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,660
the darling lady Patricia who by the way offered to come on the show today I say no

527
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:47,140
I know it's a full bar I wouldn't want you to get hurt come on the show Monday and

528
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,520
so she's she's I think she's really wants to so that's good

529
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,960
So I, you know, I won't have to twist her arm on Monday.

530
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,500
Thank you, Spuds, from the Mr. Hey, Mr. Jesse podcast, show that I listened to regularly.

531
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,060
Have you heard the group the papini sisters?

532
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,160
Well, that's what y'all just heard now with their rendition of Gloria Gainers, I will

533
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
survive.

534
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,780
We featured them on the June edition of Hey, Mr. Jesse, along with the Star Sisters,

535
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,520
as Jesse did around up of awesome female vocal groups.

536
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,320
Of course, the papini sisters aren't prods safe, but at least give them a listen.

537
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,280
And of course, they will have a link to the, you know, to the papini sisters website.

538
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,320
It is the papini sisters dot com, but links to that as always in the show notes at

539
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
dailystoresco.com.

540
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,680
Yo, well, yeah, it seems to be catching on Andrew Grummit from Engineering at HQ,

541
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,680
who checks in with an update.

542
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Hey, Adam, it's Andrew Grummit here, or should I say eight to the G and I've got a dev team update

543
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,680
from HQ.

544
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:02,680
This update is a new enhancement to the site that we'll be pushing live today,

545
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:09,680
or depending on when your listeners are tuning in yesterday, or maybe even a while ago.

546
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:17,680
And this update contained, is Andrew, is Andrew, did this, like, on his headset,

547
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,680
or seems like he did it late at night somehow?

548
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,680
All right, let's listen to the update.

549
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Means a new feature on the episode upload page for podcasts.

550
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:37,680
The way the page used to work was that you would select your file and enter all the information

551
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:43,680
and hit the send button and then you wait and it's some future unknown time.

552
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,680
The file upload would complete and you could check to see that everything went okay.

553
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,680
On the new page, or really it's just the same page with a new feature.

554
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:00,680
The default will be to report progress as the file uploads into the system.

555
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
This was an experimental feature.

556
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,680
Up until this point, you could click a link to try an experimental page.

557
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:14,680
But now we've integrated the experience into the regular upload page and made it standard.

558
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,680
So podcasters will be able to monitor the progress and see exactly what's happening.

559
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,680
And when they can expect the file upload to complete.

560
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,680
So we hope that it will work flawlessly.

561
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,680
But wait, I have Linux and I can't use flashlight.

562
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,680
Much testing to ensure that there are no surprises, but just in case.

563
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,680
Or if your browser doesn't support the.

564
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,680
I use the rendering technology, which is based in flash eight or later.

565
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,680
There's a check box at the bottom and you can just click it.

566
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,680
It reads click here to use the standard uploader.

567
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,680
And if you click that check box, the upload should work as it did before.

568
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,680
So we hope everyone will enjoy all the podcasters out there.

569
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
We'll enjoy this feature.

570
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,680
And that's that's it for now.

571
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
As you know, we're working on.

572
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Some fairly exciting new stuff with channels.

573
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,680
I just sent you an email update actually about some new work we're doing there.

574
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,680
But we'll have to leave that as a tease for the moment.

575
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:27,680
And hopefully that piece will be coming out fairly shortly as we get it in shape.

576
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
Okay, that's all for me for now.

577
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,680
Talk to you later.

578
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
Bye.

579
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,680
So far we're, let's see, there's about 100 people at Pod Show now.

580
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,680
We've had three of them calling with updates.

581
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,680
Not bad, 3% of the company is called into the show.

582
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:49,680
I'm expecting more.

583
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,680
I don't know where it's going to come from, but I am expecting more.

584
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,680
So yeah, Andrew did send me a he and Devon are working on on the channel.

585
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Actually, we're doing it to the three of us.

586
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,680
I love working with the developers this way where I can just, I haven't,

587
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,680
I've given them any feedback yet, but I can give them feedback on stuff that they're developing.

588
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,680
And it's a, it's a beautiful loop that just did to we reiterate over and over again,

589
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
and stuff just starts to happen.

590
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,680
So the, the channel module that you have, that if you have a Pod Show account,

591
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,680
the channel module now, what I have working in, in the lab.

592
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,680
I don't have it working, but what I'm, what I'm, when I'm allowed into the lab to play,

593
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,680
to play with the toys, you can collect either shows or episodes,

594
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,680
put them in any order you want, visual drag and drop stuff.

595
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,680
And it comes out the other end on the feed exactly the way you put them in there.

596
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,680
So it's not reordering it.

597
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,680
And you can say, I only want to have one episode of the show appeared any, any given time.

598
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,680
I'm going to be putting all kinds of examples up.

599
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,680
As soon as this gets pushed to the production servers, which I think will be pretty quickly.

600
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,680
Because, well, because it's just going so fast,

601
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,680
and it's really just reorganizing the things we already have.

602
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,680
I'm not trying to downplay the code.

603
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,680
These guys are writing, but we already have so much of it already in place.

604
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,680
So I hope we'll be able to start playing with it very soon.

605
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,680
I got to put a, you know, a couple other buttons there, so that, you know,

606
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,680
be like a play in the dashboard, put it on your iPod.

607
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,680
And yes, we will resurface the orange on, or the white on orange XML buttons.

608
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,680
And people are getting pretty excited about building channels because this stuff really does work.

609
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
Hello, Adam.

610
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:38,680
This is Clyde J. Kelly, the voice of the old-time radio shows that were broadcast on the serious satellite.

611
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,680
Now, we're beginning to year with Pod Show.

612
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:49,680
I just want to call you about your, just channel matching our channel mix up on the Pod Show network.

613
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,680
I tried this and had a remarkable results about Friday or Saturday.

614
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:03,680
I got a site on there. It's an MP IR dot podshow dot com.

615
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,680
It's an old-time radio site, of course.

616
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:13,680
And I had some shows along with some other channels with other providers that I use.

617
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,680
And I have a remarkable thing happened Sunday.

618
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:22,680
I had over within a five hour period, over 6,600 downloads on just one of my,

619
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:32,680
the Pod Feets. And all I can say is it's probably due to the podshow dot com channel mixing service.

620
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:39,680
It'd be nice when we can actually publish the entire channel feed to the world.

621
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
It's interesting to see the results there.

622
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:51,680
To start, let you know, I've been listening to the daily source code ever since the first year when I was honored to host the old-time radio shows on the serious network.

623
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,680
And I like your content. Keep it to good work.

624
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,680
I like it.

625
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:02,680
And let me thank you and your network for doing such a great job on preserving these public domain programs that are not,

626
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,680
you know, they're not that far from what we're doing today.

627
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,680
And I'm so happy that you've seen how powerful channels can be.

628
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:16,680
And it's really interesting because people who know nothing about RSS and the underlying technology,

629
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,680
and immediately catch on to the fact of how you can mash all this stuff together.

630
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,680
But people who are much more hardcore,

631
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,680
you know, with the underpinnings of the delivery mechanisms we use on the internet.

632
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,680
And like, well, you know, they sometimes don't see it.

633
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,680
But for the first time, have you ever sat there and thought,

634
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
I should put this out on a feed,

635
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,680
but it's like individual things and I've got a hand code,

636
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,680
something, or I've got to get a WordPress blog to, you know,

637
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,680
or use feed burner to be able to,

638
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,680
just had another great idea.

639
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,680
Crap.

640
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
Hold on, let me just write this down for a second.

641
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,680
I can't tell you what it is.

642
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Oh, man, my brain just fired.

643
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,680
Oh, geez.

644
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
Oh, man. Why was I smoking?

645
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
Okay.

646
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,680
You can literally create a feed of anything you want,

647
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,680
just by dragging and dropping stuff and hitting, you know,

648
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
you don't have to hit anything.

649
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
If they hit save, it just works.

650
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,680
And it plays in sequence and it, that poops out as nor assess feed and

651
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,680
sequence and poops out as a stream in sequence.

652
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
Oh, we're going to have so much fun.

653
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,680
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

654
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Let me see what else I get here.

655
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,680
Oh, this was, this was interesting.

656
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,680
You know, I have a live 365.com account.

657
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,680
And this is a company that allows you to stream.

658
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,680
That's kind of weird.

659
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,680
Can't quite seem to get the anyway.

660
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,680
They allow you to to create streams.

661
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,680
They have like 10,000 streams.

662
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,680
I pay a small fee and it actually covers or used to cover some of the,

663
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,680
the licensing for the music if you want to put music in your feed.

664
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,680
And of course, now with the copyright royalty,

665
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,680
it was at the, the copyright royalty board imposing new and

666
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,680
improved fees for streaming radio internet radio,

667
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
which by the way, this is also internet radio,

668
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,680
and depending on how it's internet radio that you can take with you,

669
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,680
that you don't have to be connected to the internet to receive it.

670
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,680
On June 26 from 3 a.m. Pacific to midnight,

671
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,680
all 10,000, the live 365 streams will be redirected to a special stream.

672
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,680
They're calling for a day of darkness, basically.

673
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,680
A day of silence, they're going to silence all internet radio streams,

674
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
which is interesting.

675
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,680
I guess they want to bring attention to it by out raging listeners.

676
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
I don't think that's the right idea.

677
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,680
And by the way, please have a look at the pod safe music network,

678
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,680
and have a look at the pod safe music network license,

679
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,680
because since it's a pre-arranged agreement,

680
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,680
you won't have to pay any fees over it.

681
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,680
You'll probably have to pay your 400 bucks a year or 500 bucks per channel.

682
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,680
I don't think you can get out of that, which is, of course, kind of crazy.

683
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,680
But you won't have to pay any other fees,

684
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,680
because it's pre-arranged, and the artists are happy,

685
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,680
and the labels are happy for you to play it as pure promotion.

686
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,680
So, that's just a tip from the kid on a football Friday.

687
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:22,680
Your Honor, I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

688
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,680
Your Honor, please don't bang that gavel.

689
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,680
You can try this cowbell out, let's all give a night.

690
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:39,680
To the hardest work in the lawyer, he's Jersey Typing in.

691
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,680
He's Jersey Typing in.

692
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,680
Here on a year, what's going on by an atom?

693
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,680
It's Jersey Typing, the official musicologist of the Cha Cha.

694
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,680
Dude, every week I am just absolutely amazed about the talent and quality

695
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
that's coming up on the positive music network,

696
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,680
and this week is no exception, at least.

697
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,680
This week I've got somebody absolutely fantastic for his name.

698
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,680
Well, I like his name a lot.

699
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,680
It's Todd Carey out of Illinois.

700
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,680
Probably Chicago Todd, but that's not the point,

701
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,680
because the point is that he has just got such a great song up on the PMman.

702
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,680
It's called Inkot Love.

703
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,680
And darn it, this song is darn near inspirational.

704
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,680
I'm really, really into what I love the slow build.

705
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,680
Check this out.

706
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
It's Inkot Love by Todd Carey.

707
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,680
On, you're from Bar Friday, check this out.

708
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,680
I got friends.

709
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,680
Mmm, so sweet.

710
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,680
To sing to when I'm passing on the street.

711
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,680
I got my guitar.

712
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,680
To play when I'm down.

713
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,680
And my group full loud enough to rock this town.

714
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,680
But it all comes down.

715
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,680
Nothing in the end.

716
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,680
But you ain't got that.

717
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,680
But you ain't got that.

718
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,680
But it all ends.

719
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,680
Nothing in the end.

720
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,680
But you ain't got that.

721
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,680
But you ain't got that.

722
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,680
Where I know.

723
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,680
I want to sing.

724
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,680
But just another funny guitar boy in me.

725
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,680
And I know.

726
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,680
To go my time.

727
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,680
But still I'm really into the fact I'm right.

728
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,680
That all comes down.

729
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,680
Nothing in the end.

730
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,680
But you ain't got that.

731
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,680
But you ain't got that.

732
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,680
But it all ends.

733
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,680
Nothing in the end.

734
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,680
But you ain't got that.

735
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,680
But you ain't got that.

736
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,680
I got my vibe.

737
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,680
So it's all in my mind.

738
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,680
It's clean when it's cold.

739
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,680
And I got my clothes.

740
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,680
And tear my foot.

741
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:30,680
But I still don't have a word.

742
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,680
But it all comes down to nothing in the end.

743
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,680
But when you ain't got that.

744
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,680
But you ain't got that.

745
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,680
But it all ends.

746
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,680
Nothing in the end.

747
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,680
But you ain't got that.

748
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,680
But you ain't got that.

749
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,680
But it all comes down.

750
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,680
But you ain't got that.

751
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:10,680
But you ain't got that.

752
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:26,680
But you ain't got that.

753
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:33,360
Todd, once again, truly the official music colleges of the Charlie, inspiring is correct.

754
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:40,840
For Melanoi, he's got love, Todd Carrey, brand new on the plot team music network, and on the Charlie.

755
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:46,800
Oh, I knew that, boom, boom, boom, it didn't happen, it didn't come, oh my god, what are we gonna do?

756
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Let's have a word with the Nile, let's spread the news with the smile on where the role of light.

757
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,800
We're in your polite, let's listen to the Nile, no food bars complete without him.

758
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,800
Hey Adam, it's the Nile on.

759
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,800
Maybe.

760
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,800
I've got my beard and blonde wig on, I go into high and as you suggest it.

761
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,800
You won't recognize me from that one.

762
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,800
But after yesterday's show, I guess, all I can start up by saying is D-D-D.

763
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:21,800
I-I-I-C-C-K-K-K testing, testing, anyone there testing?

764
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:28,800
But no, what I really want to call was being a self-pulcane, good versus jank expert.

765
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,800
I want to get credit to the brits for finally getting one over the yanks, and that's in the form of Mr. David Beckett.

766
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Who's Sunday has many no-players last game, it's Real Madrid, and as you pay K-Papers fail to really focus on,

767
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,800
they're losing one nothing for the 60-plus minutes he was playing.

768
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,800
A substitute comes in, his substitute scores are gold, and they score three goals in the 20-plus minutes that he's not playing.

769
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,800
Which is to the point, which is David Beckett doesn't score goals.

770
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,800
He does assist, as you record, we record in the US.

771
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,800
You have basketball, you have a search, and baseball, you have sacrifice, flies.

772
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,800
He's not a pay lay, he's not going to run up and down the field scoring goals.

773
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,800
It's a big sham for the Galaxy of the 80-150 million.

774
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,800
People are going to be crowding the stadium looking for Beckett to score, and he's going to do a great kick.

775
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,800
It's going to bounce off some nuts head, and then go out of bounds.

776
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,800
It's not going to work.

777
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
It's a great thing the brits have done.

778
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,800
They are finally gotten back at the yanks.

779
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:30,800
So, in the world of international football soccer, I think it's the brits one, and the yanks nothing.

780
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,800
Of course, for the fifth, and credit to David Beckett.

781
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:41,800
And for the guy in New York, he should try the time outsidetimeout.com, which has a New York section, which is very good,

782
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,800
and New York Magazine.com, which has a section above all the things happening in New York.

783
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,800
So, I hope you flight was fine, and I'm hoping you were landing.

784
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,800
You won't go in landing, Charlie, two, two, two, three, three, three.

785
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,800
It was the same.

786
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,800
Anyway, let me put my mustache and wait back on.

787
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,800
Please do head back out.

788
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,800
Yeah, it was funny when I thank you, Nylon.

789
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,800
By the way, I have no fucking clue what you were talking about.

790
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,800
It's just like you almost put a downer on the food bar.

791
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
The food bar, man.

792
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,800
I got to get rid of the nylon first, hold on.

793
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,800
Oh, he's nylon.

794
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,800
I'll spokin' it, fake treat.

795
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,800
He's in London, buddies from New York.

796
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,800
Whoa, he's nylon.

797
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,800
Controversy on nylon.

798
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,800
He's in London, buddies from New York.

799
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,800
On a, when I came back, it was, so the weather was getting,

800
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,800
starting to get pretty crappy.

801
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,800
It was a little bit windy, crosswind.

802
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,800
I said, look, I'm going to join base leg,

803
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,800
because there wasn't a lot of traffic,

804
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,800
which means they don't have to fly a full circuit.

805
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:59,800
And I'm on long final, and Alister, who's, he's a real old-time aviation dude.

806
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,800
He was manning the tower.

807
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,800
And so he says, you know, number 277,

808
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,800
Delta shared land to your discretion.

809
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,800
And you know, I think I'm being nice and I say,

810
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,800
okay, clear land, long fine, also they know that I'm coming in from a long way out.

811
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,800
And it was like, no, land at your discretion.

812
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,800
Oh, crap.

813
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,800
Sorry, landing in my discretion.

814
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,800
Apparently, it's not exactly the same thing.

815
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
It must be a legal thing, I don't know.

816
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
What's going on here today?

817
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,800
It's Friday.

818
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,800
Well, I'll see if I can get this out properly.

819
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,800
So I had two very interesting conversations,

820
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,800
which were non-advertising related.

821
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,800
One was with the executive assistant of the Havas agency.

822
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,800
He was a Iranian.

823
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,800
And you know, it's, of course, I had to mention that,

824
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,800
you know, she'd been back two years ago.

825
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,800
She'd been back to visit family in Iran.

826
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,800
And she speaks Persian.

827
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,800
She speaks French.

828
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,800
She speaks English, obviously.

829
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,800
Very, very interesting woman.

830
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,800
And I said, you know, I've been to Iraq.

831
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,800
And we were just chatting back and forth.

832
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,800
And you know, we were talking about how crazy it is that, you know,

833
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,800
that these apparently the United States and Iran hate each other.

834
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,800
And I was like, yeah, man, you know, it's like,

835
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,800
it's like, it's a very, it does are like modern countries.

836
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,800
And they've got iPods and cell phones.

837
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,800
And she was agreeing with me, of course.

838
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,800
And she gave me a very amazing statistic that this about 80 million people

839
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:27,800
in Iran, of which 50% is younger than 25 years old.

840
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,800
And that they are all over the place with blogging.

841
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,800
Of course, it's all in Persian.

842
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
And you know, I said, well, he has your job clearly.

843
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,800
You've got to start translating some stuff and getting the word out there.

844
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,800
Because apparently they're really well connected,

845
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,800
a bunch of folks over there.

846
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
And we should be able to communicate with them.

847
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,800
And they also speak perfect English.

848
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,800
So that was kind of mulling in my head.

849
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,800
And then I had dinner with Sean Finnegan from OMD with,

850
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,800
I told you about when the chief sales officer for Yahoo.

851
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,800
And I forgot his name.

852
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,800
Top guy at the BBDO advertising agency.

853
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,800
And I'm hearing them talk about the democratic nomination.

854
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,800
You know, who's going to be the democratic nominee?

855
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,800
And you know, it was all this talk about Hillary.

856
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,800
And I think when it actually knows Hillary and then you're about Obama.

857
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,800
And then it was, you know, it kind of,

858
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,800
and I was being very quiet.

859
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,800
You know, the conversation moved over to, well, you know,

860
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,800
what it's, you know, look at what happens to you if you're president.

861
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Like look at Bill Clinton, you know, as hard when he turned gray.

862
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,800
George Bush, same thing, you know, that's somewhere.

863
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,800
And then they get that glassy.

864
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,800
I'd look, which I equated to the same as, you know,

865
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,800
any superstar celebrity has that.

866
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,800
You know, it's just you get hammered at all the time.

867
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,800
So how he not eventually get the glassy I'd look.

868
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,800
And then something interesting happened is like

869
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,800
the conversation turned a little bit like, well,

870
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,800
gee, I'd hate to have that job.

871
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,800
And I said, you know, kind of, I just got a stop here for a second.

872
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,800
You know, and there was all kinds of other discussion about how the world

873
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,800
hates America and, like, well, first of all,

874
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,800
any American should be really proud to be president.

875
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,800
I mean, I know I'd never get elected,

876
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,800
but damn, I really, I'd be very proud to, you know,

877
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
to work for the American people.

878
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
It would be fantastic.

879
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
You know, and then, you know, it's like, well, yeah,

880
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
but, you know, that's your only job,

881
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,800
but listen and George will be Bush doesn't listen.

882
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,800
I said, look, dude, he doesn't make all the decisions.

883
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,800
We have something called, like, you know, Congress.

884
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,800
We got the Senate.

885
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,800
You know, it's almost become a joke to say, you know,

886
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,800
write your congressmen if you're unhappy,

887
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,800
but you actually have to because that's how shit gets done.

888
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,800
And there were some, some thought there for a second.

889
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,800
And then it would, you know, it quickly turned to immigration.

890
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,800
And well, you know, we got people coming into the country

891
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,800
and they're taking advantage of the system.

892
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,800
And, well, stop again.

893
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,800
What do you mean taking advantage of the system?

894
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,800
Yeah, illegal immigrants.

895
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,800
They're what fucking system?

896
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,800
What health care?

897
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
They're taking advantage of that schooling.

898
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
Free schooling.

899
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,800
And there's like, well, yeah, I can put it that way.

900
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,800
I guess you're right.

901
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,800
So no, please, I just want to make one thing very clear.

902
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,800
I've lived in a number of countries.

903
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,800
I've worked in a number of countries.

904
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,800
And the United States of America,

905
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,800
if you're willing to fucking do something,

906
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,800
get up off your ass and get it done,

907
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,800
that's the place for you.

908
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,800
If not, stay in France.

909
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
35 hour work week.

910
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,800
Take your time.

911
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
If you're sick, you can, you know,

912
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,800
and everything's paid for.

913
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
You can, oh, even if you have no job,

914
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
you can probably take a vacation.

915
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,800
If you want the socialist way,

916
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,800
that's fine.

917
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,800
And lots of people love that.

918
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,800
But the United States, I found myself

919
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
just becoming all patriotic.

920
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,800
I didn't know.

921
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,800
And I'm not even necessarily a Democrat

922
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,800
or a Republican.

923
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,800
But just the words came out

924
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,800
and the more I thought about it,

925
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,800
the happier I got.

926
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,800
And I said, yeah, you know,

927
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,800
I'm sorry.

928
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,800
I don't think the world hates America.

929
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,800
It's the same thing with the Iranians

930
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,800
and with us.

931
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
It's like, we're all the same people.

932
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,800
We all have the same shit.

933
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,800
We've all got iPods.

934
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,800
We know how to blog.

935
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,800
We're starting to talk with each other

936
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,800
around all this other crap that's going on,

937
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
which we do have to fix by the way.

938
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,800
But I think I got through to some people there.

939
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,800
And I don't know.

940
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,800
It just felt good.

941
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,800
So there's no real moral to the story

942
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,800
other than I'm really proud to be an American.

943
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,800
I don't think the world hates us.

944
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,800
And we have some shit to fix.

945
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,800
And we're going to fix it.

946
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,800
We'll do our best at least.

947
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,800
But crap.

948
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,800
No one's country is perfect.

949
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,800
But just, you know, I think some flying up high

950
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,800
had something to do with it as well.

951
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,800
When you look down on the earth and you just think,

952
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,800
all those issues that people have and all the crap

953
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,800
that's going on, it seems.

954
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
So petty.

955
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,800
So my news.

956
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,800
It's so small.

957
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,800
We're on this little fucking nut.

958
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,800
Yeah, we're in it together.

959
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:46,800
We really should check ourselves.

960
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,800
I can only contribute to television.

961
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,800
We've all been completely fucking hypnotized by crap that's on TV.

962
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,800
Of course, you know, I couldn't leave you with that.

963
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,800
I couldn't let that be the final thing of the week for you.

964
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,800
I got to roll it out with one of my favorite songs of all time,

965
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,800
which a copy of which was sent to me by Tom Scuding.

966
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,800
That, of course, is the official biographer of my media life.

967
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,800
Good old Tom down there in Australia.

968
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,800
And I guess we found on one of the tapes that he's been digitizing.

969
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,800
But this is one of my favorite songs of all time, and he's right.

970
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,800
And Cigaya was fortunate enough to meet,

971
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,800
and he is just as awesome as the song.

972
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,800
Michael Martin Murphy.

973
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,800
And Wildfire on a football Friday.

974
00:55:47,800 --> 00:56:01,800
She comes down yellow mountain.

975
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:07,800
On a dark flat land she rides.

976
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,800
On a pony she named Wildfire.

977
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,800
When the whirlwind by her side.

978
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,800
On a comb of breath tonight.

979
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:40,800
Oh they say she died on winter.

980
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:46,800
When there came a killing frost.

981
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:56,800
And the pony she named Wildfire.

982
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:02,800
Busted down its door.

983
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:08,800
In a Blizzard he was lost.

984
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,800
She ran calling Wildfire.

985
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,800
She ran calling Wildfire.

986
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:29,800
She ran calling Wildfire.

987
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:45,800
By the dark of the moon I planted it.

988
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:50,800
But there came an early snow.

989
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:56,800
There's been a who'd out having by my window now.

990
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,800
For six nights in a row.

991
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:05,800
She's coming from me and I know.

992
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:19,800
And the wildfire will be riding wildfire.

993
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:25,800
With the riding wildfire.

994
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:31,800
With the riding wildfire.

995
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:37,800
On wildfire we're gonna ride her.

996
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,800
