Hey you Adam, it's Tony from your neighborhood.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
First thing, since you're in New York, maybe you can swing by New Jersey.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Come out to the old stop and grounds and record the DSC 563.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You know, hang out with the fellas, you know.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Learning and oddy, sharing, and talk about hot moms.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How about Cecilia?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So the one out to the DSC 563 from the old stop and grounds in Jersey.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
After all, your voicemail numbers are Jersey number.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Come on home, Adam, do 563 at home.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No one wants to say in.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm destined to be its pet and courage.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You've had your heart aches.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No! No! No! No! No! No!

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't know who this is but,

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm fucking cold, you're down to ammo.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
She got to get me up, she got a little more sick.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
She got to find his glass.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You ever seen, she got to get out sweet.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I want to go, she's still your heart.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So tell you that she'll come.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As you tell you realize that she'll be gone.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You know she's the kind of girl you're gone.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And take it all, she's real.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She got to get her, she got a little more.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
She got to prove it looks, she gets it up to you.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
She got sexy walk, girl who is legs.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't hate your talk, she must be your bitch.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
She must tell you that she'll come.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
As you tell you realize that she'll be gone.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You know she's the kind of girl you're gone.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And take it all, she's real.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You know she's the kind of girl you're gone.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Beautiful, beautiful.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, he is baby.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She's just like Barbie.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Here we go

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Play that hooky music baby, play that hooky shit

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Play that hooky music baby, I'm getting off on it

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're a game

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's a home

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes you are

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're so sexy

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Beautiful

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sharing

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
She got a caveat

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
She got a little more to go

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
She got a body stance

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You ever seen it

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She got a bit of a swing

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll make it more

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
She's still your heart

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Come back home

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
She'll tell you that she'll come home

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
She'll tell you that she'll come home

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
She'll tell you that she'll come home

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She's not the kind of girl you're gonna

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Take it home

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
To your world

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She's not

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't just hear it Charlie

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Five, six, three

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Full bar Friday

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How you doing everybody

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Delphinium blue

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Kicking off today's

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Full bar festivities

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
With beautiful

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Different

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But listening to his tracks

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
On the pot's a music network

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I was like, oh guys, it's got some of my like it

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't know what it is

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I think I played California

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Another track by his

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
A couple of months ago

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Not very appropriate of course

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
When your show is coming from New York City

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I just realized that on average

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Except for yesterday and Monday of course

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When there was no show

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Because just absolutely impossible

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
For me to record anything

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's been that

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Filmed that jam packed

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But I realized that I talked to you guys

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
More than I talked to my wife

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I spoke to Patricia for 10 minutes today

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That was and that was at like six o'clock

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And we still had two more meetings to go

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So yeah

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Really is a real football Friday for me

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And of course when I say

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I spoke to Patricia today at six o'clock

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It is Friday

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's 1245 AM

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So it is officially the 16th of March

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
2007, but of course this is being produced for your

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Enjoyment on Thursday evening

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The day started off really, really fucked up and said

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I got an email early in the morning

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That could friend of mine

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That is a dad at a past away

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And it just fucking sucked

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It was no way to start the day

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I could consider it a little bit

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Of course having lost my mom recently

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Also friend of runs

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And runs that past away a couple of years ago

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So you know stuff kind of creeps up on you

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You start to think about things again

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And so on the one hand

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well completely sad

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
In his honor

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I really felt like enjoying life today

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And everything I did I did with passion

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And really enjoyed it

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Even though

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm tired and full barred

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It felt good

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You know it's really enjoying what was going on

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And almost a perfect day

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The weather wasn't quite as nice as yesterday

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
When it was sunshine

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I mean

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
New York in that nice kind of spring

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Spring weather

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh man

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's really nice

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So even started to drizzle

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Mid afternoon

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So much

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't even know where to start really

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You know what?

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Maybe let's do this

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll tell you what

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why don't we get things started

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Freshen up just a little bit with

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Some exercise

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Or should I say

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh yeah

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Maybe nothing like being on the road

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And working on my ass

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Maybe max

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hey Adam

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Good morning

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Afternoon or evening

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Have a great time

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We're recording today

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It doesn't matter

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Because it's time to exercise

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm ready to exercise

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We're on the floor today

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So do you need to do to get yourself situated

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh I love being on the floor with you Amy

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is an ad move

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But it definitely works the butt

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm ready

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Lay down on your back

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Alright

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Arms to your side

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Now legs up to the ceiling

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They should be 90 degrees to you

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh man

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's like

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Lower them toward the ground

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But only as far as you can

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Stretching your back

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's very important to protect that back

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Of course you're squeezing the butt

182
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Now bring them back up to 90 degrees

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Squeeze the abs

185
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Lift the butt toward the ceiling

186
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes I feel it

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Come back down slowly

188
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And lower the legs again

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's one

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You have seven more to go

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh you're kidding me

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
These are tough

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Lift

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Squeeze

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Lower

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Lift

197
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Squeeze

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Lower

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Lift

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Squeeze

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't hold your breath

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Squeeze my butt

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Amy

205
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Good

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Use the arms for balance

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay

209
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Keep those legs straight

210
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But not locked

211
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Give a damn

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I can hardly keep you straight

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Keep breathing

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So stiff

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Fantastic

216
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Looks like my work here is done

217
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This is Amy Mac and until next time

218
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm just like

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh man

220
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And it's land nasty laying on a hotel carpet

221
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Don't you know what I mean?

222
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
God man, hotel carpet

223
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's like creep me out

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I have like hotel rooms

225
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
To do it to have like wood floors

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And you know I will not walk

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
With wet feet on a hotel carpet

228
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay

229
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I mean if I can if I can avoid it

230
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I won't walk with bare feet at all

231
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Um

232
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And this is I didn't see any slippers

233
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So I just been wearing my socks

234
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And the bathroom but no slippers

235
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So

236
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Anyway

237
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Tomorrow

238
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Visit to Sirius sideline radio

239
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
To see the folks at HQ

240
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hopefully get some dirt on the mergers

241
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So I'll let you know

242
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Here the New York sounds out there

243
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And of course I'll be leaving tomorrow

244
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Evening flying back to

245
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Back to the UK

246
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And well the expecting snowstorm

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Is not convenient

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's three to six inches in New York

249
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The sun's so bad

250
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Ah

251
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We'll see

252
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Luckily

253
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
New York knows about it in time

254
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But you'll see people are going to

255
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well maybe you actually

256
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Maybe a lot of people won't come in and on

257
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We'll just take a long weekend

258
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That will be kind of nice

259
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Because then the city won't be crazy

260
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And we can kind of get out on time

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And that will be cool

262
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let me see

263
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What can I tell you about

264
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Just wrapping up the week

265
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's almost like I'm talking to Patricia

266
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I could tell you all the stuff that we've been doing

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But you know it's like business stuff

268
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Literally did not do anything

269
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Except last night

270
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Ron is wife Marta

271
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And I went out for dinner

272
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And we found this place called

273
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Django's

274
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Django's

275
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Django's

276
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Which is not far from the hotel

277
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And we had really nice meal

278
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It was really really awesome

279
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What was it?

280
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I had

281
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The

282
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Dorey

283
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's what I had

284
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And we had some really nice wine

285
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You know we took our time

286
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And we didn't talk about anything

287
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Which meant we were kind of silent for most

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Most of the evening

289
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Because we're old white guys

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Manly get tired from this shit

291
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But it was a lot of fun hanging out with

292
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
With the sales weasels

293
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
In New York

294
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So we had of course Chris

295
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And head sales weasel

296
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And sales weasel Greg

297
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And then we have

298
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Jersey sales weasel Andrew

299
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And you know these are the guys that are out there

300
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Making it happen you know

301
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Connecting the dots

302
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You know the advertising

303
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It doesn't happen automatically

304
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Because you know we're not like a Google

305
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We don't you know just

306
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Insert stuff

307
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Randomly or seemingly

308
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's some kind of relevance

309
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You know we're working on brand advertisers

310
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And that means we're you know

311
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We're talking to

312
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Advertising agencies

313
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And advertisers clients directly

314
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Who are

315
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You know they they want their brand represented properly

316
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They don't just want to be inserted in anything

317
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Or have you know like be a

318
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
A banner next to a dating site on a huge social network

319
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You know they want to be

320
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They want their brand recognition within

321
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Really with the audiences

322
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And I think we're getting through to them

323
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And creating content

324
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know and don't just create an ad

325
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Make content

326
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And it's fucking useful

327
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And you know so

328
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's I have to say that really does kind of turn me on

329
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You know to be working with people really hard

330
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And trying to get stuff going and

331
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And close deals and help people understand

332
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What our vision is for how

333
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We believe this can work and how

334
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You know and showing the examples of how it has been working

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And it's been a very very successful trip

336
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I mean we work really hard

337
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But it well worth it

338
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And it's really cool when like you know

339
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We can close a deal while we're

340
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
While we're doing this on the road

341
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You know or at least for us on the road for the guys

342
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And you know it's their home it's their home turf

343
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And we got

344
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't know I don't know if I can say it

345
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But I will anyway

346
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So we

347
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We close a deal with cover girl

348
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Cover girl cosmetics

349
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm very excited about that

350
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
For a number of reasons one

351
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Because it's you know that's prestige

352
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And it's and they have

353
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Really they have extremely good content ideas

354
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
For people who will be interested in their product

355
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So they're not going to just be doing some kind of

356
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Positioning beautiful girl running

357
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Running around through a video podcast

358
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You know that we've got a real plan

359
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Where they're going to be creating

360
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Content that's relevant to their customers

361
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So I'm excited about that

362
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Also you know the amount of people involved

363
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And putting this together

364
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's pretty unique because

365
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Cover girl is a proctor and gamble

366
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
From the proctor and gamble company

367
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And they don't mess around

368
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Proctor and gamble very very sophisticated

369
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Company

370
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
They have very you know the way that company works

371
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You know it's a regimen

372
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's it's I'd have to say

373
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
In a way

374
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It wouldn't be fair to compare them to Walmart

375
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But they do you know there is a strict regimen

376
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Let's put it that way

377
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You I think when you when you arrive at proctor and gamble

378
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The first thing you learn is how to write memos at proctor and gamble

379
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So really cool that we could

380
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That we can get them on board

381
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And then two agencies media vesta

382
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Is involved and grey advertising

383
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And you know it's I'm excited about it

384
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Very very excited

385
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And that's all I can say right now

386
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Meanwhile we have

387
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Richard Brewer hey who of course was with me in North Carolina

388
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He went from North Carolina after hanging out for another day

389
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Meeting people there which you know I told you that was a lot

390
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
A lot of fun and very cool

391
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He went to

392
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Taxis for South by Southwest

393
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
A company

394
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Michael Butler the rock and roll geek

395
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And it's interesting because you know my email is I'm still

396
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The email is still popping over

397
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
From the Gmail from my original account

398
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's I think it's going to take like three weeks for these four gigabytes

399
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
To be transferred towards South stupid

400
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So you know my email is a little bit messed up

401
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And Richard sends me an email and then he sends me another

402
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Like they came in the wrong order so I didn't quite get it at

403
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It was an update and then he said I'm also

404
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Sending this I'm also calling this in into the voice mail line

405
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And I presume that he meant that this was for the show

406
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Doesn't matter really because as I was listening to it

407
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm like this is really interesting if more people from pod show would

408
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Call in to my to the voice mail number and

409
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Hold on a second the voice mail number

410
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And if they could do it just the way I'm hearing Michael

411
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Sorry Michael Michael and Richard do it

412
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's actually it's I think it's pretty entertaining

413
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So they're basically giving me an update a pretty personal update I have to say

414
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And you know and it's not like they're not announcing stuff that you're saying

415
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Hey this is what we're working on here so we met with

416
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And I was like you know why wouldn't I play this this is really interesting

417
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So um

418
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Check it out

419
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This is the behind the iron curtain of the death star

420
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hey Adam it's Richard calling from Austin Texas

421
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The I have no idea how the quality of this is going to come out

422
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But just one of the call and let you know that the beer belly tool continues

423
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I have taken my belly now from Wilmington North Carolina

424
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's Austin Texas for the staff by Southwest Festival

425
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The belly he's now joined by the Butler he's now he's making his bed as I speak

426
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I can't roll

427
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We're in the hotel room here in Austin

428
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Butler's like spinal tap making his bed going

429
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Rock and roll

430
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We just got done with our first big meeting of the week

431
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Michael got a meeting with Jeffrey and Jacqueline from the orchid

432
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Right on which is huge

433
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The world's leading digital distributor of music

434
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
With a very good name Michael was pushing the

435
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
We wanted to get access to the back catalog

436
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And they seemed very receptive to that so that was very good news

437
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You hear this these guys are out there trying to get more pod save music onto the network

438
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm really this is so incredibly cool and this is you know a big part of what Michael Butler does

439
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Um, you know people know about it maybe but it means a real job, you know

440
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He's really working hard on this and

441
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Hard on

442
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I said hard on and I took talking about the need for more hit-up

443
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Which they were very receptive to too

444
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
In fact, it was a very productive meeting. We have a very good meeting with them

445
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
We're dinner it was about two hours long

446
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And we just wanted to let you know that we think we're going to have a lot more music

447
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I feel like I'm I should be stroking my white pussy cat right now, you know

448
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm in command central and everyone's reporting back to me

449
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The network's from them. We already got two loves

450
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
We should check out

451
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And who else did they give us Michael

452
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Um, what about that?

453
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You just ran you happy so I think you've already played on your shop

454
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yep

455
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah, they give us a bunch more stuff right after this is over

456
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
A bunch man

457
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
A bunch man

458
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
A bunch of people

459
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So as you can tell from Michael there's a bunch of stuff out there

460
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't know

461
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't know

462
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
When you're a daily reports from South Pacific, South West

463
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Excellent

464
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's going to be of this high quality which we're leaving it now

465
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So this is why you're on your show

466
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So you don't play it on your show

467
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And the breadlets sign up

468
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Hopefully I'm in front of New York

469
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't play it on your show

470
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's what you think

471
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So I would have played that for you yesterday

472
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Um, and they did call in with the second report

473
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And since I don't have a show for the weekend

474
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm going to play the second report too because it really gets beautiful

475
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What these guys are doing

476
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Um, oh, and we have another sponsor

477
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Uh, of the network Tylenol PM

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And they're sponsoring a show by Angie B

479
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Of course you know Angie with her dulce tones

480
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Uh, she's, you know I'm secretly in low with Angie

481
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But don't tell her

482
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Um, the show is called unwind

483
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And let me just get the, uh, we get this cool little

484
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Briefing, oops, anyone who participates in the campaign

485
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Get some briefing, just open that up for you

486
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Because it had some cool things in there that I wanted to say

487
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So I was talking to Ron about Tylenol PM

488
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And he actually uses it

489
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't see, I don't have any problems sleeping

490
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Um, I have accent pains

491
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Um, because that's, I guess that's just what happens

492
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What you hit forward over 40

493
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But I have no problem sleeping and we all know why

494
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Um, so, but I will try it

495
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Now, we'll definitely try it, Ron takes it

496
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Because it's just hard for him to go to sleep

497
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I guess, I don't understand why really

498
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Um, and sales Weasel Greg

499
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I was in, we were in the cab on the way to, on the way to cover girl

500
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Actually, I said, uh, and my neck hurts because yeah, I do get neck pain

501
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I guess because in New York this week has in a way been a pain

502
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You know, neck literally

503
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So you got any aspirin, I figured Greg have, have aspirin

504
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And he has like a bottle and I pull too odd

505
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
She says, no, no, don't take those those are blue

506
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Oh, you're right, that's the Tylenol PM

507
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
We don't want to take those before the meeting

508
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Uh, because apparently they do work quite well

509
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
They relieve pain and sleeplessness

510
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Uh, what does it, here you go

511
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Effective relief from pain and sleeplessness

512
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That is non-habit forming and won't have you groggy in the morning

513
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Right on

514
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So I am going to try those out

515
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And I know someone else who is going to love them

516
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Patricia will love them

517
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Um, because she, um, sometimes she has trouble getting to sleep

518
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And she's a very light sleeper

519
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So I, I think she wouldn't mind

520
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Seeing if that would work for her

521
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
She tried all kinds of stuff

522
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Um, in the past

523
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So, and, and now, initial have to come on the show

524
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Because she's, she's got endorsed the product

525
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh man, speaking of that

526
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You got to listen to this feedback

527
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
This is awesome, this is a total awesome comment for Fubar Friday

528
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Check it out

529
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Graham

530
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Fully

531
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Great, and all fuck

532
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
No queer

533
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
A queer

534
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's been a while since we had a chat

535
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Hello mate

536
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You will recall how the dough has shitting jolly

537
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Fucked up my life

538
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And how it was that gave you so much joy

539
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I don't remember how it fucked up your life

540
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I wish you would have reminded me

541
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But it doesn't matter because the rest of the comment is brilliant

542
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You won't, girl

543
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Thank you

544
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But I don't get angry anymore

545
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm freshly at a rehab

546
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So instead, I make little lists

547
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Of all the shit you want me to do

548
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That I ain't gonna fucking do

549
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And I've been saving a few up

550
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Anya they are

551
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Number one

552
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't give a flying fuck what your house is called

553
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Because we all know

554
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And ain't really your house

555
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
A brain to your act, my son

556
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Is your message

557
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Jets off to Holland on a Monday morning

558
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Does it better dance in

559
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Better duck in

560
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Better dive in

561
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Get some boots

562
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And get some bit of a bun from the old restaurant

563
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The royal east

564
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And then flies back home on a Friday night

565
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
To Patricia's Pita tear

566
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
If you're a Pita tear

567
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm telling you

568
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And when I get back home

569
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
On Saturday

570
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The next day she leaves

571
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
She's gonna do the exact same thing

572
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
A little fashion show

573
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Jett off to Holland

574
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Threads and beads

575
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Come on back

576
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
To Patricia's Pita tear

577
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Are you right my friend?

578
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Number two

579
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I don't need

580
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Another fucking domain name

581
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
All right son

582
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
In fact, the only time I want to wear the words

583
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Go Daddy

584
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Is when me house boy Juan

585
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He's naked

586
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And laying across the dining table

587
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Three

588
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I don't

589
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I got us

590
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I got to send that one to go Daddy

591
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
They'll enjoy that as an endorsement

592
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
He fucking sugar

593
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
All right

594
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I don't take fucking for

595
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Trinity

596
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Free train

597
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That would have been a splendor mention

598
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But you forgot that part

599
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And it is not free train

600
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Who gives a flying fuck

601
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You can grab in its tank

602
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You can shit on its seats

603
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Cool like here

604
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You can piss in the washable

605
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I've only got one suggestion about Trinity's son

606
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Swan

607
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Vesta

608
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Swan Vesta

609
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Number six

610
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Do you think you could possibly use your influence

611
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
New York contact

612
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
To have Eric Bergen come around and come on my face

613
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
H-U

614
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
H-U show

615
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Keep it up son

616
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Folder

617
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I don't know

618
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Let's ask his mom

619
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Hey Adam

620
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This is Alice and Lee

621
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Calling in from www.craftcats.com

622
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And I just have to let you know

623
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
After playing my voicemail comment on your show

624
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The other day

625
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
How many men rode in

626
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Wanting to help me out

627
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
With my my coming problem

628
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
As you can hear

629
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's fixed

630
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
No it's not

631
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So there you go

632
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Shivori is alive and well on the internet

633
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So thanks again Adam

634
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And you know what darling

635
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Your show rocks

636
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
We got it

637
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You got to stop giving me humbers like that

638
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Okay

639
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's an outrage

640
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
A serious satellite listeners

641
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Thanks for checking us out once again

642
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
We back next week in the PCH's next

643
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I guess

644
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Hi

645
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Adam

646
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Says Eugene

647
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
My friends at the ten minute blitz pod cast

648
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm going to be celebrating their 100th episode next week

649
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And I'm working on assembling messages

650
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And congratulations to air on their 100th episode

651
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I know you are so busy in New York right now

652
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But can you please record a short

653
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
30 seconds max

654
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
30 seconds max

655
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Short 30 seconds max

656
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Congratulations

657
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Or greeting for them by Thursday afternoon

658
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Oops

659
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Oops

660
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And send it to me

661
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If you don't have time for that

662
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Could you make a mention on your next

663
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
DSC episode

664
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I will clip it out from there

665
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I know they'll get a thrill from hearing from you

666
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And re-jordan and billiard

667
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
All teens who take their pod casting seriously

668
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And you are one of the inspirations

669
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'll thank you Eugene

670
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So that's ten minute blitz dot pod show dot com

671
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That's cool

672
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Ten as in a number ten minute blitz

673
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
BLITZ dot pod show dot com

674
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
100 episodes

675
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Crap

676
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I got to listen to that show

677
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Excellent

678
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That's nice

679
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Thank you very much

680
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You know we should probably

681
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Start disregarding 100s of milestone though

682
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'll tell you why

683
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's not that you know I don't believe in the milestones

684
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's not cool to celebrate that

685
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But the morning I was watching

686
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Is it the today show

687
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
What's Willard Scott on?

688
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You know because I'm up so early

689
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Or was up so early that

690
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Yeah

691
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I keep watching all the morning shows

692
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Whatever Willard Scott's on

693
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's sponsored by Zuckers

694
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I know that

695
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I think that segment's been sponsored for

696
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
A million years by Zuckers

697
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Jam

698
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So you know I remember Willard Scott

699
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And you know he would always congratulate

700
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
People who were celebrating their birthday

701
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And the birthday was pretty much like a hundred years old

702
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You know it was like pop-pap-pap-pap-pap

703
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Fanfare still reads the newspaper without our glasses

704
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You know Granny Annie from Florida

705
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And it was amazed

706
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Because a lot of these birthdays

707
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
We know these people were celebrating

708
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
108

709
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
109

710
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
103

711
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And you know you look at the picture

712
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And I don't know if the pictures are current

713
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But you know they look pretty good

714
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
As like wow that's pretty fucking space age

715
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You know

716
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That I can remember when people just

717
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It seems like we're living 10 years longer

718
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So maybe

719
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
50 is the new 40

720
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And 40 is the new 30

721
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Ah

722
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Now if only I can convince Angelina Jolie that that's true

723
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
When I meet her

724
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Next month

725
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Over the course of 19 weeks

726
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
One monster filled

727
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Bloody audiobook

728
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Rue to terrifying audience of 30,000 listeners

729
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
In the process

730
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
He became the number one literary show

731
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
One iTunes

732
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And every other podcast chart

733
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000

734
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000

Closet Wayne the Print

738
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
On April Fool's Day

739
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Figure out your copy of ancestor

740
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000

Sound and good Scott

744
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
April 1st

745
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Is what it drops

746
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Excellent

747
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Ah

748
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Hey

749
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Whenever old buddies calls in

750
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And he thinks we can't tell who he is

751
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Because he's calling in at any

752
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Different state of mind

753
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Adam

754
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
How you're doing?

755
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So I'm back in London

756
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You probably know who this is

757
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
By now no it's not James

758
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Although people do often call me James

759
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's Charles the Drunk Londoner

760
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Except is not drunk

761
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm name wrong

762
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Who knows why

763
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So if I'm back in town

764
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Haven't been in touch for a while

765
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Been very busy

766
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Haven't even updated my blog

767
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And all that kind of geeky stuff

768
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But

769
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Trying to think that you were talking about today

770
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Or yesterday or whatever show

771
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I can't remember

772
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But I'd love to have 500

773
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You don't give a shit

774
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You're far too busy and important

775
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
For me to bother counting what it is you do

776
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So

777
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah

778
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Of course I would

779
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Usually save up lots of comments

780
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And try and send in something

781
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And usually do it when I'm drunk

782
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And mess it a lot

783
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
By the way, that's not really handy

784
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And you know how much I appreciate

785
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You calling in Charles Drunk or not

786
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But it's not handy

787
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
When you do a whole bunch of comments together

788
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Because it's like then it's too long

789
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And then you know

790
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It just makes us sing

791
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Just do one

792
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
If you don't mind

793
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Probably to be concise

794
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Okay

795
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You were talking about current TV

796
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Or what is your list

797
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah, okay, I understand at point

798
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
About a voting

799
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
There's some voting that

800
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah, it's lame

801
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's really old hat

802
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And the big media players

803
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Unfortunately don't seem to understand

804
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
What the revolution is all about

805
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But you know what?

806
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
We've got to ease them in gently

807
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And

808
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And currently

809
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Have got some

810
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I was chatting with them

811
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
A few months back

812
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And they've got some really exciting shit plan

813
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It is going to be one to watch

814
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It really is

815
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And

816
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
There's some really excellent ways

817
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Of utilizing

818
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
That space for

819
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
For marketing and promotion

820
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And selling

821
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We're not dissimilar from the way that you work

822
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Don't get me wrong on that

823
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I like a lot of things that current TV is doing

824
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And of course

825
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Now we're in the middle of a revolution

826
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
But

827
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's going to be such a long time

828
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Before

829
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We've really made mainstream media

830
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Or it's influence

831
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Because I like a lot of mainstream media

832
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But in that regard

833
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
When it comes to reporting and news

834
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And current affairs

835
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's going to take quite a while

836
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Maybe ten, maybe 15 years

837
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's just going to take a while

838
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You will see it progressing

839
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Very quickly

840
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So this is just a

841
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
A cog

842
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Not a cog

843
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's just one piece of the machinery

844
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And obviously

845
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's appreciated

846
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But I personally think

847
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
That

848
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
We're better served doing it online

849
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I don't know why I don't have any

850
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't have any real

851
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Well thought out theory

852
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It's just a hunch

853
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That's all just a hunch

854
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I took my hat off to

855
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's kind of a bold move

856
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I think

857
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Although I have to say

858
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's yours with eating bolder

859
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The sort of brazen

860
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Hey look I like this

861
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I like that

862
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It's my own brazen

863
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It's honest

864
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And you know what

865
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
We will appreciate that

866
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
The other thing is

867
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I want to say

868
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
What are your feelings about

869
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I don't want to beat

870
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
By the hand of two people

871
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I want to say

872
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What are your feelings about

873
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
What's going on and by

874
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Now

875
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That's interesting

876
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
He says

877
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I don't want to bite the hand

878
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
That feeds me

879
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Slag off clients

880
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Charles

881
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
What do you do man

882
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You working for the man

883
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You working for Viacun

884
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Hmm

885
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The other thing is I'm going to try and get through

886
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's real quick

887
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I'll sound the tube

888
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'll just start working

889
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah

890
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
What do I think about Viacun

891
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It's pretty interesting

892
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I spoke to

893
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Is it Abby Klassen

894
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
She's the digital reporter

895
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
For

896
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Is it ad week

897
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
God

898
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So stupid

899
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I don't know

900
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Too fried

901
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Too footballard

902
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Here

903
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You know

904
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
What do I think

905
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh my gosh

906
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I think the most important thing

907
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Is really

908
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
The copyright

909
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Thing is pretty important

910
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And I find it interesting

911
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And I'm just really interested in what people are writing

912
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And I'm amazed

913
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
How many people don't really understand

914
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
How copyright works

915
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And also how many people don't understand

916
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
What kind of effort

917
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And money goes into making something

918
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Whether you're doing it by yourself

919
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Or whether you're Viacun

920
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Creating a show

921
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It just feels like

922
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
People don't really understand

923
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And how much work that is

924
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And what kind of value that can have for yourself

925
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And

926
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Whether someone stealing it or not

927
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Just understanding that

928
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's apparent that a lot of people don't quite get it

929
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And also what type of rights there are

930
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Particularly in mainstream

931
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Right down to

932
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Obviously

933
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The actors

934
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You know there

935
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's different rules

936
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's a whole different rules set

937
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's not just rules

938
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But an infrastructure that's been in place for a long time

939
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
To drink something

940
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I would like major league caught in mouth

941
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Hold on

942
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Once even starting to gross me out

943
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Hearing it through the blue max

944
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Personus

945
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Compressor

946
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Now where was I?

947
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Unviacum

948
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's kind of interesting

949
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I read a lot of people saying hey man

950
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You know you've already made enough money

951
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Viacum

952
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
What's your bullshit

953
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You know the people wanted

954
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Why don't you give it to us

955
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And

956
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You know

957
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I think back to

958
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
When we made a rather stupid and embarrassing mistake

959
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Of how we presented

960
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
RSS feeds when we first launched

961
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Pot show plus and how everyone jumped on our shit

962
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And you know calls us thieves

963
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And shady and evil

964
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And god knows what

965
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Still some people are on about that

966
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That's probably the whole

967
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Reason why Keith and the girl hate me

968
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Or hate pod show or whatever

969
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
At least I think that's what I understand

970
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And

971
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You know yet about YouTube

972
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And or go to

973
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And Google video

974
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You know people are pretty laid back about that

975
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Because they're enjoying the content

976
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
So

977
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And I think it's

978
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It isn't negotiating

979
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Step

980
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You know Google

981
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It'll be settled

982
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
That's for sure

983
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It'll be settled

984
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But it'll be interesting to see

985
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You know what

986
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
What will be left of the

987
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Of the intrinsic value I guess

988
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Of what it was sold for

989
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Depending on what limitations there are

990
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
On monetizing that

991
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So I love YouTube

992
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I like it

993
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
For us it's distribution

994
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I love it when one of my shit shows up on YouTube

995
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
That's really good

996
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
But I think

997
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
When it comes to a solid

998
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Base for a media company

999
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
No, it's not really

1000
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's not really the way to go

1001
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
In my opinion

1002
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But

1003
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
On the other hand

1004
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'll say

1005
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Wow, you know

1006
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's kind of like my

1007
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
VCR in a way

1008
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
If I just wanted to see the best part of the

1009
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Daily Show

1010
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
From the previous evening

1011
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
No matter where I am in the world

1012
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Bingo

1013
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You know it shows it to me

1014
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So

1015
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
As a single stop shop

1016
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
As an aggregation of

1017
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Cool shit

1018
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And you know it's there

1019
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It was at least fantastic

1020
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So

1021
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Unless

1022
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Comedy Central

1023
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Starts

1024
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Something in a podcast feed

1025
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You know it's just going to be a pain in the ass

1026
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
To go to all these different sites

1027
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Maybe that's what I like so much about it

1028
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
So

1029
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Well

1030
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
We'll see

1031
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's just another

1032
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Another step

1033
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It'll be another piece of history

1034
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Eventually

1035
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And I'm going to say that

1036
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
With a piece of Charles Centin

1037
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
For another day

1038
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Because I want to get to the second

1039
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
To report

1040
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Of the belly tour

1041
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Coming to you from South by Southwest

1042
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Richard Brewer Hay

1043
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And Michael Butler

1044
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Together

1045
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
In their hotel room

1046
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And by the way

1047
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I guess that it didn't mean for this

1048
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
To be on the air

1049
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But I encourage them to continue

1050
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Sending reports

1051
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And

1052
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Really anybody within Pod Show

1053
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Dial something in

1054
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
This is cool shit

1055
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Let me know what you're doing

1056
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Adam

1057
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's a beer belly

1058
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And Butler

1059
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Part two

1060
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The beer belly

1061
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Pleisty night

1062
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's about court across midnight here in Austin

1063
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And we're back in the hotel

1064
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And we know we kind of wish that

1065
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
We're going to try and make it till three

1066
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But

1067
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's actually the rock and roll geeky

1068
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And I was staying

1069
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So I'm going to blame it on him

1070
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But we had a pretty good day today

1071
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
We met with some

1072
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Some good folks

1073
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
We met with the local media

1074
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And marketing

1075
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
We met with Adam

1076
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Who's the director of operations

1077
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And Jennifer, who's their publicist

1078
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And their PR firm

1079
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Representing a bunch of independent artists

1080
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Some of which were already on our network

1081
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And a lot of which we want to get on the network

1082
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And we met with the owner

1083
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Sideways media in the coal

1084
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
She's down in LA

1085
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And searching her most speech

1086
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And she invited us out tonight

1087
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
She wanted to advance

1088
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Junior

1089
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Junior

1090
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
They were really good

1091
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Michael wasn't

1092
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
A big fan of him

1093
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Because they wore their baseball hat's back

1094
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It was a little bit of a jacket

1095
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So we could see the bills were enjoying it

1096
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
They were bouncing up and down

1097
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
We're just kind of nice

1098
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah

1099
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And then we met with Adam

1100
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Who's the managing director

1101
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Of North by Northeast

1102
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Which is the equivalent of

1103
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
South by Southwest

1104
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
You just imagine these two guys

1105
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I mean

1106
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You don't know Richard that well, perhaps

1107
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I know a lot of people on the network

1108
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
No Richard

1109
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And Michael Butler of course

1110
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I think everybody knows

1111
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
These two guys are staying in one hotel

1112
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Room together

1113
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
South by Southwest

1114
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And they're going to show us

1115
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Where guys with baseball caps

1116
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Backwards to make the girls jump up

1117
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And jump up and down

1118
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Getting horny

1119
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I can tell

1120
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I guess 2 graphics equivalent

1121
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Up and where is it?

1122
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Can it work out if you can

1123
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Is it Michael?

1124
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
That's right

1125
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Alright

1126
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So that was pretty well

1127
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
We did a good day

1128
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Excellent

1129
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So a bunch of bands

1130
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Gotta get tired

1131
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
That's about it

1132
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Michael had

1133
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
What was it you wanted to ask?

1134
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Oh yeah

1135
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So we had a good night

1136
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And Michael was feeling a bit horny

1137
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So he was wondering if there's any way

1138
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
We can expense getting a cold bill

1139
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
We figured that

1140
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
We figured you might be able to let us know

1141
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So let us know if we can expense a cold bill

1142
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And then we'll go ahead and do that

1143
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Because we're sharing the hotel room

1144
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
We figured what to help

1145
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And you think it easy

1146
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Hopefully you'll appreciate it

1147
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Well, cheers

1148
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Bye

1149
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Have a nice day on TV

1150
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
We've already had this cold girl

1151
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So we've already done it

1152
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
We just wanted to...

1153
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
We just wanted to...

1154
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm sure I'm full of blood

1155
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
But...

1156
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Uh...

1157
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
No, you can't expense it

1158
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
But I'll pay for it

1159
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
My pleasure

1160
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Haha

1161
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm glad you guys had a good time

1162
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And don't worry

1163
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
If you won't say anything about what

1164
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm gonna do to Angelina Jolie next month

1165
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I won't tell you your wife about what you guys were up to

1166
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Okay

1167
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
There'll be our little secret

1168
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Alright

1169
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
See, we're closing it on 40 minutes

1170
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So time to wrap it up

1171
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But we can only do that

1172
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
With one man

1173
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Our brand new Papa

1174
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000

Hi everybody!

1231
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Through bars!

1232
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And now need your number reactions

1233
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I don't need your fingers pointing on

1234
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I don't need your alcoholics

1235
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I don't need your jurisdictions all up

1236
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
That when you couldn't get connected

1237
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
No one now towards listening

1238
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I don't do anything now

1239
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Well, it can't stop you anyway

1240
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You go with the kid you are

1241
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And you love to relax in the room

1242
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Don't do anything that I ever did

1243
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You're finally coming over me

1244
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And I didn't know you would feel it

1245
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
No, no, no, no, no

1246
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I don't need your sexual secrets

1247
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I don't need your cocktail conversation

1248
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Conversation

1249
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I don't need your two fake sections

1250
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I don't have to worry about nothing

1251
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Now that you're gone

1252
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And the way it's been lifted

1253
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
No one else is listening

1254
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I don't do anything now

1255
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Well, it can't stop you anyway

1256
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You go with the kid you are

1257
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And you love to relax in the room

1258
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm doing the best I ever did

1259
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You're finally coming over me

1260
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And I didn't know you would feel it

1261
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
No, no, no, no, no

1262
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'm doing the best I ever did

1263

You're finally coming over me

1264
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And I didn't know you would feel it

1265
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
No, no, no, no

1266
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
The news again

1267
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The news again

1268
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
The news again

1269
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The news again

1270
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I don't need no, no, no, no

1271
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You're in a set

1272
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I don't need no, no, no, no

1273
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You're in a set

1274
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm doing the best I ever did

1275
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You're finally coming over me

1276
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And I didn't know you would feel it

1277
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
No, no, no, no, no

1278
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
No, no, no, no, no

1279
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm doing the best I ever did

1280
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
You're finally coming over me

1281
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And I didn't know you would feel it

1282

No, no, no, no

1283
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm doing the best I ever did

1284
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You're finally coming over me

1285
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You're finally coming over me

1286
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Oh, yeah

1287
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Sir Jersey Todd strikes again

1288
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
The official music college of the Charlie knows exactly what's going down

1289
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
The Milwaukee's love it

1290
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Links, of course

1291
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It is source code dot com

1292
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It's Friday

1293
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Well, I gotta tell you I have a couple of final thoughts of the week

1294
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Because it's been quite an interesting one here in New York City

1295
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
As the snow flurry started to dwindle down

1296
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
As we just have to stop enjoying the nice spring weather

1297
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Looks like goldman winter is going to give us one last blast

1298
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Before it's a time for him to head on

1299
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Up north, wherever the heli goes

1300
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
First of all, let me just say that

1301
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
One of the advantages of going

1302
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Being middle-aged

1303
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Is, you know, I'm seeing, and especially since I haven't really been

1304
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
In the advertising scene in New York for quite a while

1305
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
You know, we've had our trips, but this was really serious

1306
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You know, this is the people who really make decisions

1307
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
By our strategists, creative people, and they're into it

1308
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Now it's really deep, and so it's not just us presenting

1309
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It's working with these people

1310
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And one of the advantages of being middle-aged

1311
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It hurts to say this

1312
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
There's a whole new generation that's come into work

1313
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Of these agencies

1314
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And the girls are cute

1315
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
They're hot, love it

1316
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Let me see what else that I want to say

1317
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Ah yes

1318
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Yeah, the definition of luck

1319
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Because we see a lot of that

1320
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I consider myself to be extremely lucky

1321
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
But it really is when preparation meets opportunity

1322
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And I think you should always bear that in mind

1323
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Because you do make your own luck

1324
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And then finally, you know, just think it in my body

1325
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And that will pass away, it really is true

1326
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
No matter what you're doing, live your life to the fullest

1327
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Live your life with passion

1328
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Use their wings, take those day food by Friday

1329
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And I'm spinal thought on the reef

1330
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Alright, have yourselves a great weekend

1331
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We'll talk again on Monday, I'll be back home at the manner

1332
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Ah, to care everybody

1333
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Bye-bye

1334
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Another poncho podcast

1335
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Stick it in your ear

1336
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
The best in the brightest, served up daily

1337
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
By the sharpest minds and content delivery

1338
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Pajo in my life
