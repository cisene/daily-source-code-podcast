1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And the beginning there was A.M. radio, families everywhere would gather around the living room,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
listening to their favorite programs, and all was good.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Who knows what evil looks in the hearts of men, the shadow knows.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then came the advent of F.M. radio.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now broadcast could be heard in stereo, and teenagers found this, especially in tweaking,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
as rock and roll music to be heard with great clarity.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
However, parents became concerned as to what this music was doing to their kids.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now it's the 21st century, and satellite radio is all the rage, or is it?

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In a world where TV networks, movie studios, and record labels still think they can govern what you see in here.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses and make big media corporations wet their tiny little pants.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
From Pod Show, home of the world's most dangerous new content comes the Daily Source Code with Adam Curry.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Delta Sharon Charlie 568, it is from our Friday.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you know the lyrics, please feel free to sing along because we're fucked up beyond our pain.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And let me let you love me.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sitting in your face and tell you I love you too.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I love to hear you more allies when I'm between your eyes.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You blow me away.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
To my face and let my lips embrace you.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll sit in your face and let love you truly.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Life can be fine if we both six to nine.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If we sit in a face as adults as a place as a play.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Till we're blown away.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're so explicit, you're show.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I never miss it though.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think you and me should kick it.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Come with you to screen I want to get it.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Come on.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now try to pump you up or inflate your ego.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Now this is just place.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't you know.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I tune in week after week.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I want to be a host of love and internet geek.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Like the way you move over here.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Like the way you're out here.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Thank you, soccer, football, making my nays.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I come home to you in and I turn out the lies.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm your number one fan.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You don't know.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm here.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll do everything you want.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Because I want you so bad.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're good.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I can't tell you're free.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We see you.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I passed a little secret.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Day time library.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Night time on the free show.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're good.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Like the way you move over here.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Like the way you're out here.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Thank you, soccer, football, making my nays.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I come home to you in and I turn out the lies.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm your number one fan.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You don't know.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I am.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll do everything you want.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Because I want you so bad.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I can't tell you're free.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I want you so bad.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why is the score for you?

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've run for you.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I've run for you.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I've been keeping that touch short.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll give you a new hope.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll resign.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I need to short.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I wanna score.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Like the way you move.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, like the way it's done.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah!

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Thank you, soccer girl for making my nights.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I come home to you in an eternal life.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm your number one fan that you don't know.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm gayer.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I've been waiting for you.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I've got to want you so fair.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What a way to kick off a football Friday.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A brand new bro low soccer girl from his new album.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Somehow a little birdy leaked that song to me and boys.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's perfect for a football.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hey, everybody.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How you doing?

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Daily source code episode 568 coming to you from an overcast.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And somewhat damp.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Uh, affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gilford.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
G. Town West side represent.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's the curry manner.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The Lord of the Manor at your service.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hey.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Uh, what a way to wrap up a couple of really busy weeks.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yesterday with bum rush the charts.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Wow.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We made the needle move.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I couldn't.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I could really.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I was blown away.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
How fast it actually happened.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Now has the song.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Black labs.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Mine again.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Reach number one.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I didn't expect to see much.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let me tell you just in.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The events as they unfolded yesterday.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Of course, I recorded the show relatively early and was busy.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
In the city and London for most of the day with meetings and stuff.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So only could, you know, catch some casual updates as they came in.

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And the first thing I got which I thought was I learned so much from this exercise.

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You know, even as I was doing the show yesterday, I'm thinking, wow.

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You know, it's already the 24th of the 27th in Australia.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You know, how at least times of global campaigns are not very easy.

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And also in the full knowledge that a lot of people would listen to my show at the end of yesterday.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Or perhaps even today or tomorrow or next week.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And I'm thinking, wow, you know, this is really something like this.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It doesn't really work on a one day, one day shot only.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, we moved the needle in day one, which is great.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But I think that if we were to continue this, which I don't believe we're going to do.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It doesn't really make sense because to me, the proof is already here.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Let me just tell you what some of the things that learned yesterday.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
First of all, the Washington Post had a great article about bum rush the charts.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And I wasn't able to read that before I did yesterday's show, but I got it sent to me.

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And there was one piece that I thought was really interesting.

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
They took the effort, which I really appreciate Mike Musgrove of the Washington Post,

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
to contact Apple and got through to Derek Mainz, a spokesman for Apple,

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
who declined to comment on the campaign itself, but said the best seller list that would be the iTunes top 100

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
is compiled using proprietary methods that the company doesn't disclose.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's much more complicated than taking a snapshot of the previous 24 hours worth of sales.

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So that means you probably would have to have a sustained campaign to really make something move up the charts.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But just to enter the charts and here's what I really learned.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The individual country top 100 charts.

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Wow, that's what we really saw a lot of action.

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The United States, I don't even know if it's cracked into the actual top 100 yet.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's done a lot on the individual charts such as the rock chart.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hold on a second, I have where is it?

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Here we go.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Now this was yesterday afternoon, and so I don't have an update.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
On the rock singles charts, that is, so it's a subdivision.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
In the US, the last time I was able to check it was number 67,

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
it reminds you the only independent pod save song on the entire top 100 for the rock chart.

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:54,000
In the UK 71 Canada 22 Australia at 35 Austria 35 Denmark, number 40 Finland 42 Germany 13 Ireland 54 Italy 30 the Netherlands.

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Number five New Zealand 56 Norway 23 Sweden 9 Switzerland 42 overall the top 100 songs chart.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We entered the Canadian top 196, the German at 98, the Netherlands at 38 Norway 100 Sweden at 98.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's as of 9 p.m. Pacific Standard Time yesterday.

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So I do expect some spill over and depending on how the proprietary magic sauce.

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Can you imagine that what a weird industry we live in where the way a chart is compiled is secret.

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but it's okay because I'm so proud of what took place.

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I saw as I was really busy scanning technology most of the time.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I found that to be the most compelling to see that yes sure podcasters were in this.

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And we were telling our audiences what we'd like them to do to see if we could make the needle move.

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But it was really the audience.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I saw post things on web logs and on podshow plus pages just everywhere.

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And of course, you know, we had a great logo.

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And it was an audience participation move of anything.

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And I was just blown away by by the results so far.

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Was it sent me this.

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I got it.

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I forgot who sent me this.

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But it was kind of funny yesterday.

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This report came out US sales of music CDs plunged 20 percent in the first three months of the year.

169
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
According to the figures released by Nielsen sounds can 89 million CDs were sold from the start of the year through March 18th.

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's compared to 112 million CDs sold during the same period in 2006.

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Wow.

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, by the way, we do actually know how many people clicked on the link.

173
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So that'll be some knowledge once everything's compiled.

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Now at last count, I heard it was around 15,000 who had clicked on the by link.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
To actually purchase the song.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So I'm sure Chris Penn will have an update for us on that.

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He actually posted quite a long story about this.

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And he really, I think he approached it more as a as a promotion.

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And you know, how we could make a promotion like that work differently in the future with more success.

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
To me, it wasn't really about a promotion.

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It was just about seeing if there's enough audience to make something move that is actually visible in the big,

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
mainstream world.

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Do you realize how many tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent on on on on individual tracks and albums to get them into a chart?

184
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You know, to chart.

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's the beginning when when a song charts in the mainstream world, even if it just bobs into the top 100,

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
even if it's not at number 100, that's where the record company is jumping up and down.

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Everybody's freaking out.

188
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
They start trying to book interviews with the artist.

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You know, it would really only be the beginning of an entire campaign.

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So I never expected the song to go anywhere.

191
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Certainly.

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm just amazed it entered the top 100 anywhere on the first day.

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's really fucking fantastic.

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And of course, there's plenty of comments about this.

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Hi, Adam.

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's been downing.

197
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I listen from Melbourne, Australia.

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
First of all, let me apologize for the abrupt ending on the prime.

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I've tried yesterday.

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm certainly not a professional podcaster and have, in fact, never been involved in any

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
aspect of digital audio production.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
However, I'm just a chance for something I believe passionately in to the fact where

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I didn't actually get to bed this morning till half past one local time.

204
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Just because I was up late monitoring how things were going.

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'd just like to say big thanks to all the Aussies who got out there and pushed

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
mine again our chosen songs to number 35 on the rock charts on the Australian

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and I changed music.

208
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So why took out a guy's?

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We're showing that we have an active podcast audience here down under.

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Now, Adam, when are you going to get your butt down here?

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So we can have some cold frothy bass.

212
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Have a good one, Mike.

213
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Fold our scruncher.

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Valmed, I'll tell you.

215
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm going to come down.

216
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't, I just don't think I'm able to get my girls to go with me.

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Which may be better because what happens in Australia stays in Australia, I hear.

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Have the green from business we grow to bum russ the charts.

219
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
She calls it a grassroots effort that's using social media, including dig YouTube, blogs,

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
podcasts to try to get podsake music in the iTunes top 100.

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's interesting in light of the meltdown of traditional CD sales.

222
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
She points to the same data that supporters of indie music are trying to push sales

223
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
of the music.

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
They treasure.

225
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I understand the idea that by pushing the music.

226
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I understand the idea.

227
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
By pushing the music, they feel it will send the message to the RIA that suing folks won't

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
get them to buy that the music industry needs a to promote a broader group of music

229
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
and through a broader group of channels I might add.

230
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So then Heather, almost typical.

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't blame her for thinking this way.

232
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It says goes on to say, but at the same time, it makes me think whether it will

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
matter what music you put in the iTunes top 100 sales don't seem to matter because people are

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
copying each other.

235
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Each other CDs and letting each other copy their hard drives.

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
In the future of music is band supporting themselves through touring and other kids money

237
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
making efforts then wouldn't go into shows be a better way to point to the future.

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So there you kind of miss the point, Heather.

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The point is that people are so passionate about music and I think it's just as much a call

240
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:29,000
out to the big four labels to allow really to drop a lot of all the negating factors

241
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
of how we can consume music, listen to music, how others play music for us.

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That was just as much a shout because here's a song that I'm sure a lot of people didn't even care

243
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
about.

244
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They just wanted to participate, which is really the point.

245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The point is not, I was like Eric Bergen said yesterday.

246
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I was like, well, this is not because people like the song because you told them to go

247
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
by it and I can think that's really my point is that I know that within the daily source

248
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
code audience, you guys will do a lot of stuff.

249
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I mean, you do it every single day.

250
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The show was filled up with stuff that you're doing for me and for the audience, for yourself.

251
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Really, it's a master-betteria exercise.

252
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You know, and we do all kinds of nutty shit.

253
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We tell people where folders are scrunchers.

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I think it's just proving the bond between a podcaster or any producer of independent media

255
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
who does really its episodic content.

256
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
These are shows people call them what you want, but they're shows.

257
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We have audiences and they're growing in every single MP3 player or a computer that is sold

258
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
that enables video or audio.

259
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's another opportunity for us to grow the audience and it's very hard to prove.

260
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You know, the only people who really know the power of audience are advertisers.

261
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's really the ones who understand it the most.

262
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And so maybe now that we've started to move the needle, maybe maybe we'll see some things change.

263
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Really the only thing I'd like from the music industry in this regard is just to,

264
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
you know, to treat independent producers of programming with some respect.

265
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And you utilize any of the licenses that are available out there.

266
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You could certainly use the pod save music license.

267
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If you own the masters, all you have to do is convince the artist or the singer-songwriter who wrote the tracking

268
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
question you want to put up to convince them to sign the pod save music license to waver their ASCAP BMI fee.

269
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Or, or, yeah, to supersede that license, I guess there's to say technically.

270
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And you're good, you know, and I'm sure we'll play your stuff as well as just as much chance.

271
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Actually, you might find out that we hate your shit and we're not going to play it.

272
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And that would be a pretty interesting message for you as well considering it's your business.

273
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Ah boy, when I started this morning, I was like, I barely open my eyes.

274
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm just so full-barred, but I'm into it now folks.

275
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Hello?

276
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Hello?

277
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I had them.

278
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's Edward's when pots of here again.

279
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh, yes.

280
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm not talking about from this time, so don't worry.

281
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Just saw this article from the 75 March 2007 on the BBC News website.

282
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Had line actors in landmark podcast, too.

283
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No, I'm going to do.

284
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm going to play that next.

285
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I want to hold on a second.

286
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Because there's something much, much better.

287
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Thank God.

288
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And I was so happy Eric Bergen provided pushback.

289
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yes, they thank God.

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Not everyone appreciates bomb rush the charts.

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Because I love when we have a contrarian view.

292
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Let me say this quick Adam.

293
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This is the New Yorker in London.

294
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You're nylon.

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Really bothered by this bomb in the rest thing.

296
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Let me take up to a macro level.

297
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You can play that the big record companies run their machine and people buy records.

298
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You're running the machine and the other podcasts.

299
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
People are running the machine and saying, buy black labs.

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It'll produce a result.

301
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's manipulating the system.

302
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You both manipulate the system.

303
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And you both assume, respectfully, that you have a dumb consumer.

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If we tell them what to do, they will do it.

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And that's our power.

306
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Our power is we can drive people into desired results.

307
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay.

308
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hold on a second.

309
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh, I love this.

310
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So first of all, I think I even said this yesterday.

311
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes, we're showing that we have a machine that is equally as powerful.

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But there's a a slight difference here.

313
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The machine that is the mainstream media is based upon limited access to shelf space.

314
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There's only so many channels.

315
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Only so much ether that can be used up.

316
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So the people that have called control over it or that determine what content goes through it.

317
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
They're only giving you an offering that they determine.

318
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And they determine it by a whole bunch of factors, which I think at the end of the day is based upon,

319
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
you know, what kind of return can they get on putting something through.

320
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The difference here is we just pick something willy-nilly.

321
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You're right.

322
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It would not have mattered.

323
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It would not have mattered what we chose.

324
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We could have taken any song.

325
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Could have been a classical piece.

326
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The whole point was to show that that power is there.

327
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And that short now we did it with an aggregation of audiences.

328
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But it's not going to be too long before one individual shows audience will be able to move the needle like that.

329
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So yes, of course, that's what we're showing.

330
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And please don't be confused by thinking that we're trying to prove that the music industry,

331
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
charts and stuff works better in an independent world.

332
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Not at all.

333
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is about showing that we have a machine.

334
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So that what you shouldn't take offense to that.

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
This is, you know, if you want to show someone that your dick is bigger, you got to show your dick.

336
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Like that because it assumes both of you manipulate and both of you have consumers.

337
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay.

338
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And by the way, you got to be real careful calling at least my audience dumb.

339
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't know something at all.

340
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And they certainly wouldn't have done.

341
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What am I fucking hypnotist?

342
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Let me do my eye.

343
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Look into my eyes.

344
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You show by this.

345
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, it was, we did this together.

346
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And I'm sorry you didn't participate clearly.

347
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That is not making their own choices.

348
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You're driving them and narrowing down their choices.

349
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Okay.

350
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So again, again, I'm not narrowing down the choice.

351
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Simply proving that we can make any choice.

352
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Regardless of what we want to show or what we want to buy or what we want to buy.

353
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Well, this is, you know, this was the original idea behind priceline.com.

354
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Of course, in quite pan out that way, but we'll see this.

355
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You know, the consumers decided to support this.

356
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah.

357
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What I call an audience.

358
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The people who make me want to do this shit every single day.

359
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So it wasn't forcing anything.

360
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It was like just to show that our dick is big too.

361
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So two, this whole thing about not being directly involved.

362
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You are.

363
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And you're next to on a funding on your PowerPoint slide.

364
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
We bummed the charts.

365
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Look at our power.

366
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And you will gain some of this.

367
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Last thing.

368
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Really.

369
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay.

370
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Okay.

371
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So.

372
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Dude.

373
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The whole point of not sanctioning this as an official pod show thing.

374
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Was so that everybody can take credit for it.

375
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Anybody who's doing anything in podcasting or independent media will be able to say.

376
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Look at what happened.

377
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Okay.

378
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Will we have it on our PowerPoint?

379
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes.

380
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
For our next funding round.

381
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I don't know if we're going to need another funding round dude.

382
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But will we have this on our presentations towards clients and advertisers?

383
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You better fucking believe it.

384
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Of course.

385
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
All the more reason to have not been the official whatever of this.

386
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
God.

387
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That was really clear, wasn't it?

388
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
No.

389
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You got it wrong.

390
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
This is so everyone can take credit for it.

391
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Everybody who who participated can take 100% credit.

392
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's exactly the point.

393
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Okay.

394
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What's your final point?

395
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Is this record companies?

396
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Why are you dragging the two record companies to come to you to help you manipulate their

397
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
artists?

398
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's the new way for them.

399
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Okay.

400
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Okay.

401
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Well, first of all.

402
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I think you mean not manipulate their artists, but manipulate the audience.

403
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And let me tell you that there are a couple people out there.

404
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Princess Ty, but people who have a podcast will know these names.

405
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Nigel from the UK.

406
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Well, to an extent to Jersey Todd.

407
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I mean, these are people who get really, really passionate.

408
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I have no idea if they have any financial gain.

409
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I just look at them as promoters, promoters of music.

410
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And they, you know, they hook people up with artists.

411
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And there's lots of people doing this.

412
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And it's not just for independent artists.

413
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's for mainstream.

414
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
How do you think Thomas Dolby got on to the pod save music network?

415
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You know, this is what Nigel did.

416
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I had no idea what Nigel does.

417
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
He may be fucking Thomas Dolby's record company.

418
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't care.

419
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
All he's doing is he's coming in.

420
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
He's stepping in.

421
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He's saying, hey, how you doing?

422
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm Nigel.

423
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Look, I got Thomas Dolby here.

424
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And he'd love to.

425
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He'd look.

426
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He cut a promo for you.

427
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And here's a song.

428
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And he put on the pod save music network.

429
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
He wants to join in.

430
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Someone bringing a new kid into the playground and saying,

431
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
OK, he's a little older than the rest of y'all.

432
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But he's been around the blocking.

433
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I was out of build a sandcastle.

434
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You know, can we jump in here and play?

435
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You understand?

436
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's about the promotion.

437
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's how it works.

438
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's not manipulation.

439
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Many people can only really take place when there's a monopoly on the resources.

440
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I don't have a monopoly on audience.

441
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No one has a monopoly on audience on the internet.

442
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's just, it just don't.

443
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You know, and if you just keep doing whatever you want to do,

444
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
you'll persevere.

445
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Your audience gets stronger.

446
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Your audience has connections.

447
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
People have, you know, stuff starts to happen.

448
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
People want to join the party.

449
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So it's not about, uh, I really don't like,

450
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
do you saying that?

451
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's kind of offensive.

452
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
New Alan Creek.

453
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Oh, on the new Alan Freed, dude,

454
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I did not take money.

455
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That's, you know, that fuck you.

456
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You know, it just fuck me.

457
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Fuck me with a chainsaw.

458
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You ask.

459
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I, that's, that's very nice.

460
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You calling me a criminal.

461
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But you, we get a new, uh,

462
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
milkin dick.

463
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Don't brag about a record company that wants you to manipulate the system for your audience for desired results.

464
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
No, dude.

465
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The whole point is to expose,

466
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
not brag to expose

467
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
that these record companies really see the power in what we can do.

468
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I can't manipulate my audience.

469
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah.

470
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And hey, by the way, part of it's about to drop away by serious.

471
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Sorry.

472
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Short goodbye.

473
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I can't manipulate the audience.

474
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The audience is free to do whatever they want.

475
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And, and people don't like it.

476
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
They'll go away.

477
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
They'll find something else.

478
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I can't manipulate them because there's no way for me to

479
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
determine that it's only one choice and that there's nothing else out there.

480
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You can do a bummer to charge tomorrow.

481
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Today.

482
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Today.

483
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You don't even have podcasts.

484
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You can do it through my space.

485
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm sure you can.

486
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's just when it's podcasting.

487
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I think the message is a little bit more powerful.

488
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And I think the bond between a host and the audience is much, much stronger.

489
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And there's a relationship there.

490
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And I could tell anyone.

491
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I could have told anyone.

492
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Like we had dinner last night.

493
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Anyone at the place I could have said,

494
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Hey, would you do me a favor?

495
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Just because we're buds.

496
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You know, would you buy this song just so we can prove a point?

497
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And you do it.

498
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So that shows a real trusting relationship and a strong bond of anything.

499
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's not about bragging.

500
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Dude, you are so stuck in the mainstream world.

501
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's not funny.

502
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Take your head out of it and see the light on the other side.

503
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Nothing to brag about.

504
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
No big impression of my part there.

505
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
But you're really listening a bit there by thinking that's a plus.

506
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm team up with the media to manipulate the audience.

507
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So that's that.

508
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Last thing, the scholarship points.

509
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Go to the site.

510
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I don't see what they skip scholarships.

511
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You sign up.

512
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Do surveys.

513
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You do points.

514
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And you get money at the end.

515
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So I'm even dubious there.

516
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And I like the fact that black labs don't get in 50% of their earnings to the college fund.

517
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
All in all, it's everyone making money in a new medium sort of way.

518
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And it assumes that you can manipulate just as well as EMI or Sony can manipulate.

519
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Not moved at all.

520
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And that's all next time in New York and the W Union Square.

521
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Thank you.

522
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You're challenging me to a duel.

523
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
What the hell is that?

524
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

525
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And go reread all the information.

526
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You know, I made no money on this.

527
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I didn't get a dime.

528
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I didn't want to see a dime.

529
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's too bad that money was involved.

530
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But it's the only way we can officially charge something.

531
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's the only way people say something's believable if someone pulled their wallet.

532
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It was just about proving a point dude.

533
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That's all it was.

534
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And by moving the needle, we've shown that in a very short time with, I think, still a reasonably small audience.

535
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
We were able to make something happen.

536
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So the message here is that these audience host relationships are very, very strong.

537
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
People are very motivated.

538
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
The audience is happy to go and do some fun shit.

539
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Particularly if we can do something against the man.

540
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And love doing that.

541
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And that individual audiences will, one day, maybe sooner than you think, be large enough to move needles all over the fucking dashboard of mainstream media.

542
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Hi, Adam.

543
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Perfect programmer here from San Francisco.

544
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I need to respond to Mr. Bugwin's comment in DSE 567.

545
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And what he said that the bummer the charts thing is he doesn't understand what's going on with it or something like that.

546
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Mind the sign of it seems to be that you are trying to show the record come is that they are no longer necessary to make an artist successful.

547
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
In that they can now just upload the music part, save music network, and have podcasts to play it.

548
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And get away from the record monopoly on the industry.

549
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That's all tears.

550
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Broly think programmer.

551
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
At your command it's the Broly think programmer program.

552
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Hey, Adam.

553
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's Angie B.

554
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
By the way, that's B.E.E. like a busy little B.

555
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm sorry that I haven't said any audio feedback in a really long time.

556
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I know where did our love go.

557
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But yeah, anyways, I had a story.

558
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Since to me, by one of my chill castlessness this week, that I thought you would like.

559
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
All right, so he said he was on a photo shoot with a bunch of lovely female models.

560
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And he didn't have a stereo, so he was just playing episodes of the chill cast all morning.

561
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And he said that everyone's in like a dreamy mood.

562
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And around about episode 24, he said he was on a video conference.

563
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And the person said, hey, look behind you on the couch.

564
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And apparently two of the models were totally making out.

565
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So yeah, that's what chill cast is all about.

566
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And that's that's for.

567
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And yeah, unwind is more about taking a hot bath, popping in your earbuds, getting into your bed with the blank.

568
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's pulled all the way up to your chin and just letting go and unwinding, falling asleep.

569
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yes.

570
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And I thought that I would clue in as to why we ladies enjoy Tylenol Pam so much.

571
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
As opposed to men, there's a certain pain that we get every single month that makes it hard to sleep.

572
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And you men don't have that, so it's really great for that.

573
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And especially now that they've got the vanilla liquid, what could be better?

574
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Drink a little vanilla liquid.

575
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Ah, there goes the pain.

576
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Sleepen through the night.

577
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So anyways, check out the show at unwind.potshow.com.

578
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
See there.

579
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And you know how to make an old man smile.

580
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah.

581
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You know, the chill cast does have that effect on me.

582
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I also want to immediately make out with models.

583
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Hey, I disagree with you, dear.

584
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Men have a certain pain every month as well.

585
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And Tylenol Pam may just be very well suited for it.

586
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's called, the paying the fucking bills.

587
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah, hi.

588
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
My name is Adam Curry.

589
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm in the funny situation right now.

590
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm trying to open a parachute, which I bought in your store.

591
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And it doesn't seem like it wants to open.

592
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But I would like to do that here.

593
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah, I'm kind of in a hurry here because I'm on my cell phone.

594
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I just add some trouble with my plane.

595
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And I jumped off.

596
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And now it seems like my parachute won't open.

597
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And I want the model quay start to, which I bought in your store.

598
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And I thought maybe you could help me with this.

599
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Okay.

600
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So can you explain one more time?

601
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
What are you trying to do?

602
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay.

603
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm trying to pull that thing with my hand.

604
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You know, I'm trying to pull it so that the parachute will open.

605
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And it will expand.

606
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I think I didn't read the manual right.

607
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Or maybe I didn't read the manual at all.

608
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah, that's a quay start.

609
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah, that would be the quay start too.

610
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Okay.

611
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So what is that?

612
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
What does it open?

613
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I don't know.

614
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It seems like like the handle is stuck.

615
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You know, I'm trying to pull right now.

616
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And I don't have a lot of time, you know?

617
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Okay.

618
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So what are you trying to do?

619
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Just for me to have an idea.

620
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Oh, DSC.

621
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
5.

622
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
6.

623
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
7.

624
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Hello?

625
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Make that 8 if you don't mind.

626
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And stop the girvee.

627
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And stop the girvee.

628
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
To make a motion.

629
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
To practice further around.

630
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Man, there's a engine show.

631
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
To turn its roll around.

632
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's a football front end.

633
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Hey, Adam, how's it going?

634
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's Jersey Todd, the official musical just of the Cha Cha.

635
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Happy day after bum rushed the charts.

636
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You know, as I record this right now, all the stats aren't in.

637
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And I'm sure by the time that this edition of the Daily Source Code airs.

638
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
There's going to be a lot of discussion about the final numbers.

639
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But I got to be honest, I don't care one bit.

640
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Because on March 22, 2007, we did something spectacular.

641
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You see, I've always heard that there wasn't a podcast community.

642
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I've always heard that people were too bogged down in their artificial barriers in their turf to make podcasting anything more than a fad.

643
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
That cannot be said anymore.

644
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
That is the true benefit of March 22, 2007.

645
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Because on that day, we celebrated the fact that on one day for one band, one song,

646
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
we could come together as one giant podcast family.

647
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
On March 22, 2007, we celebrated our musical Independence Day.

648
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But what now? What now? What do we do now?

649
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Well, let me propose this, that every day, be bum rushed the charts day.

650
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Because it's not just about one band.

651
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It's about the thousands and thousands of other bands that are out there.

652
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The bands that have been out there on the Ponsate Music Network from day one and the artists that's just about to load their track today.

653
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's about each and every voice being heard, the podcast or the band, the fan.

654
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And not having a big media tell us what we need to listen to or who to purchase.

655
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I encourage every listener of the Delhi source code, each and every listener of the Delhi source code,

656
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
to go out there today and just purchase music from any artist who's going to stand up there and say,

657
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Hey man, my music kicks ass too.

658
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And let me get you a band that check out as the revolution is re-invigorated.

659
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's South Africa's one-day remains.

660
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
They recently uploaded some tracks and I'm just digging them a lot.

661
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
They're a little harder than what I normally give you on a football Friday.

662
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
But man, oh man, it's good stuff.

663
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So check this out.

664
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It's give it all away by the band one day remains.

665
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Check you later everybody.

666
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
All this time.

667
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
All this time you've been there.

668
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
All this pain.

669
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
All this pain you've made you.

670
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Oh, what you could see inside.

671
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
What you could be in that dough.

672
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
You could see what I can see.

673
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Show me what I can do.

674
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You could see what I can see.

675
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Tell me what you need.

676
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Tell me what you need.

677
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Tell me what you need.

678
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
All this time you've been there.

679
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
All this pain.

680
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
All this pain you've made you.

681
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You could see inside.

682
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What you could be in that dough.

683
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You could see what I can see.

684
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Show me what I can do.

685
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Tell me what you need.

686
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Tell me what you need.

687
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Tell me what you need.

688
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Tell me what you need.

689
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Tell me what you need.

690
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Why don't you tell me that I look at them and they'll go

691
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And I'll try

692
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Show me what I can do to make you see them

693
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Tell me what you need

694
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Tell me what you need

695
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Tell me what you need

696
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Why don't you tell me

697
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Why don't you tell me

698
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
One day remains

699
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
The pod save music network, where the wonderful

700
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Lead in there from Jersey Todd, the official musicologist of the

701
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Chacha, absolutely dude right on

702
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Whatever you want to do with pod casting

703
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Just know that you now have the power

704
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You've got proof, you can show

705
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And disagree a little bit about the community aspect

706
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
This to me was not a pod cast community

707
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Exercise, it was an exercise in audience

708
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Once again, has shown that they actually have something to say

709
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And do give a shit and do like some control and are willing to exercise

710
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
If they feel it's for the right reason

711
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
What's going on here today?

712
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's Friday

713
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
One day Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday

714
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I have a smile on the phone

715
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Wow

716
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So much to talk about as the final thought

717
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
There were he actually

718
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I thought maybe I'd talk about something that's coming up

719
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
In the next couple of weeks and I want to thank some people in advance

720
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And for the hard work they've been doing

721
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And that really is

722
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
The operations and engineering staff at Pod Show

723
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Just let me know

724
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I want to let you know that

725
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
As we have grown exponentially

726
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And of course that's not just the US

727
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But we have services in the UK

728
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And hopefully we'll be going to Germany pretty soon

729
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
There's a lot of decisions that have to be made about the big iron

730
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
About how these sight of this type of scale

731
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Really works with this type of functionality

732
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And really preparing for the future

733
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It takes a shitload of work

734
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
We are in fact going to move over to our own

735
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Colo location

736
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Which means we'll have I just called the Data Barn

737
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And the reason why is because I built one of these in the past

738
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
In 2001, 2002

739
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's a huge project

740
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's very, very complicated

741
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
If you're talking about a live application which would be Pod Show

742
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Plus

743
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And our media delivery

744
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And bandwidth and all this stuff all having to come together

745
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Within three months

746
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
The Pod Show operations and engineering teams

747
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Have really gotten a Colo set up from scratch

748
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So that includes design architecture

749
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Technology selection

750
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Think of the stores and machines load balancers

751
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Network equipment

752
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Contract negotiations with vendors

753
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Equipment ordering installation

754
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Set-up configuration

755
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And somewhere around mid-April

756
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
We're going to switch over from where we are currently

757
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Which was a typical third party outsourced solution

758
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Which I think is pretty much the way everyone starts

759
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But before the proverbial shit hits the fan

760
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
We want to make sure that we're ready

761
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And before we really turn on some interesting marketing initiatives

762
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That should bring a lot more audience into the world of independent media

763
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And so

764
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
There's going to be downtime obviously

765
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It's going to affect a lot more people than downtime

766
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Would have affected a year ago

767
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And I'm talking like huge when you think about it

768
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And you ask shit

769
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I won't be able to upload

770
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I won't be able to download

771
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Ads won't run

772
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Even people just messing around

773
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Really it bucks with you

774
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So we're going to try and put together a really nice package of programming for you to enjoy

775
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Keep you busy

776
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You know, in my space usually does like a little tick-tack-toe game

777
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Or Tetris game

778
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
We're going to try and bring you some cool media

779
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Because it's going to be several hours

780
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm not going to bullshit you

781
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And we're also going to be talking about this more in the weeks to come

782
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
As we ramp up and get ready for this day

783
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm trying

784
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And engineering and operations

785
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I promise me they'll try to make it happen on Friday the 13th

786
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Which is just fabulous

787
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Because if you can't cover it up

788
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You might as well turn it up

789
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
That's one of the Podgeos slogans

790
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So I want to thank the engineers

791
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Both in engineering and in operations

792
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
For helping podgeo grow

793
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And for putting in all these extra hours

794
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And for all the shit you're going to encounter

795
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Because of course, something's always full barred somewhere

796
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Along with that I'll say that

797
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I fully intend to talk to a couple of the engineers and

798
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And ops folks about how things are going

799
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And we'll put it on

800
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Slip off my chair, I'm sorry

801
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And we'll put it on the source code

802
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And we'll kind of enjoy this journey together

803
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And we'll try to make it not too thin foil hat-tick

804
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
If you know what I'm saying

805
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So to those men and women, I salute you

806
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And really, to all the doers of the world

807
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I love it when you get off your ass

808
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And you do something

809
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Even if you just move in your mouth

810
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I'm really going to buy a link for an iTunes song

811
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Have yourselves a great weekend everybody

812
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Bye-bye

813
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Oh yeah, I'll be smoking one for you too

814
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Another Podgeo Podgeos

815
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Stick it in your ear

816
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The best in the brightest

817
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Served up daily by the sharpest minds in content

818
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Delivering Podgeo and limelight
