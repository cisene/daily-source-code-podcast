1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You better be careful out there on next couple of weeks you hear me?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's close the room.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
No.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Two sides.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Some more later.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You better be with us.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I can be with the nearest one family.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
All the places you've got to come to my place.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm done with you!

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Walking Phoenix, Mark Wahlberg,

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
on October 12th.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Get down!

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Two brothers collide.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Maybe you could be killed.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Right?

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Right?

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We all the night rated her.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, to you, O earth and sea.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
For the hot father sent his cast with a gleam.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Because he knows that I'm short.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let him who had understanding reckoned the number of the cast.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
For it is a human number.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Its number is 666.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Well, to you, O earth and sea.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
For the devil sends the beast with wrath.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Because he knows that I'm short.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let him who had understanding reckoned the number of the beast.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
For it is a human number.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Its number is 666.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm testing his battle theory.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I left alone.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My mind was blank.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I needed time to think to get the men with front my mind.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What did I see here?

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Could I believe?

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Just what I saw in my old dreams.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What the reflection saw from how I walked my staring back at me.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Because I left dreams.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's always up.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They've a place that's way slow.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And it brings me to this world.

46
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What I thought back was not what so big back,

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But that just had to sink.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
In the midst of that fingers moment weeping.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What's on this far wheel?

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's just a play in the middle?

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
6, 6, 6,

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The no-one on the beast

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hell and fall

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
With thought to be released

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Tons as praise

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't sacred hands for free

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
As they stop to cry

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
As they're told to start

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In the night

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The fight of the army

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The ritual has begun

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Satan's world has gone

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
6, 6, 6,

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The no-one on the beast

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hell and fall

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
With thought to be released

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The no-one on the beast

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The no-one on the beast

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The no-one on the beast

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The no-one on the beast

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The no-one on the beast

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The no-one on the beast

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The no-one on the beast

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The no-one on the beast

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The no-one on the beast

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The no-one on the beast

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The no-one on the beast

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The no-one on the beast

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The no-one on the beast

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The no-one on the beast

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The no-one on the beast

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The no-one on the beast

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The no-one on the beast

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The no-one on the beast

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The no-one on the beast

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The no-one on the beast

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The no-one on the beast

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The no-one on the beast

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The no-one on this beast

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The no-one on the beast

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The no-one on the beast

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The no-one on the beast

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The no-one on the beast

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And I've always had a boy, I've always had sex

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And I've always had sex

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And I've always had sex, and I've always had sex

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And I've always had sex, and I've always had sex

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And I've always had sex, and I've always had sex

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000

00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,000
And I've always had sex

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I've always had sex

112
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,020
And I have always had sex

113
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,020
And I've always had sex

114
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,000
And I've always had sex

115
00:05:48,900 --> 00:06:02,020
I've always had sex

116
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,020
And I've always had sex

117
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,000
And I've always had sex

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,120
point to a radio station that still plays that will you? Thank you very much. And by the way,

119
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,920
I think, no, I'm quite sure that the actual hearing in my right ear has been diminished since my

120
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,280
first maiden concert. So I don't feel bad about breaking a couple of rules playing that on the

121
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,640
the chat chat. Number six, six. Hey, everybody. How you doing? Coming to you today from the curry

122
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:35,760
manner. It is a beautiful day. Oh my goodness. We were up at seven o'clock. It's crisp. It's cold.

123
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,480
The sky is blue. The sun is shining. Oh, I almost want to get back in the Delta's

124
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:48,560
era and fly. Which I did a little bit of over the past couple of days. I was in Germany. Very briefly,

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,480
flew over Sunday, Sunday night to Frankfurt. Had a meeting Monday morning and then came back. It was

126
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,120
for those of you who were paying attention to the weather yesterday in the Europe. There was a massive

127
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,920
cold front, which stretched from the south of France all the way up to Scandinavia.

128
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,000
And it was, it came in from the sea past over the UK. Actually caused a, a mini little tornado in

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Farneboro. Farneboro is, well, I can almost spit to Farneboro from, from Pharaohs where I have the

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,600
Delta's era. So we saw this coming our way as, as I was preparing to fly back and I knew

131
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,400
well, here here here are the choices. Go over this huge front. Believe me, that's a non-starter.

132
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:42,160
These fronts can go up to 40, even 50,000 feet. You do not want to be in this type of cloud and storm

133
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,440
weather system. Going around it is possible if I wanted to fly home via Stockholm, hitting it and

134
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,120
then returning back. That's always a possibility. And I said, you know, I think just looking at

135
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,600
what's going on, I can go under it. Now, by the way, I was with Captain Yos. He accompanied me

136
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,800
from Rotterdam. So I took the Delta's share over Sunday to, to Rotterdam picked him up and then

137
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:14,400
yeah, he accompanied me to Aglesbach Airport, which is just the most beautiful, beautiful airfield,

138
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,560
fantastic for, for a general aviation airfield. That's one of the best I've been to.

139
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,760
So that was, that was rather exciting. I have to say, before I forget, on the, so I dropped

140
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,480
Yosuf at, at Rotterdam on the way back. Now, we'd already, you know, passed this, this huge

141
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,160
squall line, which made life exciting to say the least. You know, it's kind of fun when you fly

142
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:43,600
into the bottom of a cloud layer. It's raining like shit. And all of a sudden, you start, you know,

143
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,800
going up at 800 feet per minute, even though the stick is fully forward, which means you should be

144
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,640
going down. Oh, yeah, yeah, it gets the blood pumping. So I've met Rotterdam. I call up Rotterdam

145
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,600
ground. You have to request start up. And the controller says, now, okay, number 277 Delta's

146
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,760
share, you're going to click for start up, is this the guy from the podcast? And I'm like,

147
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,960
that's right, everybody. I'm here on the radio. So I shot out to Renee at Rotterdam.

148
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,360
I presume he's not just on ground, that it's on control tower as well, but it's very cool that

149
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,360
he was listening. And maybe feel like, you know, I'm sitting in the cockpit going, yeah, I'm proud.

150
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,240
Now, lots of talk about it being a very special episode. Some of you have sent in some stuff.

151
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:43,360
Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip.

152
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:52,800
Oh, motherfucker, you're listening now to Adam Carey's DSC 666 podcast. And don't

153
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,680
be stupid. Don't listen to the devil. Master of hell. The blogger who is slendering God

154
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:09,680
and stop taking drugs now. I said, now, drugs are part of a problem. Not part of a solution.

155
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,480
You. Hmm. Not quite sure what you're coming from DSC. I'd say alcohol is part of the problem

156
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:27,680
before any drugs are. Anyway, so the big football Friday show, the red pill that I shared with

157
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,800
y'all, of course, invoked quite a lot of response. Here's what I've noticed. First of all,

158
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,560
those of you sending in emails is great, but I can't be reading your emails on the air. So if you

159
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,880
got something to say that we can share with the class, please send it in audio comment or call

160
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,080
the voicemail number or whatever it is. Participate in some way that I can reuse it, please.

161
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Particularly those of you who are saying, who are really pissed off and call me all kinds of

162
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,440
names. Please, please record your anger and send that to me. It's important. Also, you know,

163
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,120
even though I really try to stress this, I have not trying to delve into some kind of conspiracy

164
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,320
theory. And I'm much less interested in how the Twin Towers were demolished as to why. You know,

165
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,720
so, well, everyone's, and I'm sure that if there was a conspiracy, what a great thing to have

166
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,120
the masses focus on, you know, how the Towers collapsed instead of why. You know, why did these planes

167
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:31,360
fly into it? Why? Why is all this taking place? And it's really amazing. For some reason,

168
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,880
and I'm sure television has a lot to do with it. A lot of people basically think that, you know,

169
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,320
that this has never happened in history, that the powerful people who basically owned the money,

170
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,680
that they're not manipulating, that only happened in the past. You know, that happened,

171
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,600
well, the last time that happened was was basically, you know, the Nazis and Germany. That's kind

172
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,080
of the last time that that stuff happened. And media was manipulated. Yeah, I think it's pretty well

173
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:02,560
documented that, that, that, uh, would, what was at the gobbles? Was that, uh, was that Hitler's PR guy?

174
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,280
I think it's pretty much been proven that there was a lot of mass media deception going on. But of course,

175
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,760
that was the lie. It never happened after that. Not for a single minute hasn't happened after that.

176
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,480
It's Ed Loss from Postmouth here with a bit of feedback about episode six, six, five,

177
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,800
and the idea of having a chip implanted and only being able to use money if you have this chip.

178
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,040
Okay, let me just preface this for those of you that didn't hear episode six, six, five.

179
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:36,400
This is zeitgeistmovie.com, which I really enjoyed watching. The premise of this is saying,

180
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,320
actually, they had a, uh, some quote proof, a friend of one of the Rockefellers said that this

181
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:52,000
is what Rockefeller told him that the ultimate goal of, uh, of starting wars and, uh, and taking

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,480
way freedoms was to ultimately have all money flow through embedded RFID chips. So instead of having

183
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,360
a bank card, which is pretty damn close to an RFID chip, by the way. Instead of having a bank card,

184
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,760
you'd have a chip and you just, you know, use this to scan every single science fiction,

185
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,440
futuristic movie portrays this, by the way, which means it's inevitable or it'll never happen.

186
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,760
I think there's a distinct possibility. You know, Mike, my animals are all chipped.

187
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,480
You know, the defra, as they call it here, Department of,

188
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:32,960
Ecaf, Ecaf, Ecaf something in agriculture. Uh, it's, uh, ecology, food, recreation,

189
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,240
agriculture. Don't remember what it's done for. They can scan my animals. They can scan almost

190
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,080
every single animal. That's just a, just a, you know, it's only like 50 centimeters higher,

191
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,600
and then they can inject more of those in me, you know. Uh, so the point is if, uh, all money would also

192
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,760
be, um, communicated through your embedded chip, and if you acted up and didn't play along with

193
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,760
the game plan, what we just turned off your money. So that's what this comment is about.

194
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh, this is episode 666, and obviously people have been sending you a lot of, uh, comments and

195
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:15,040
things about the number, and it all comes from Revelation, chapter 13, verse 16 to 18. And he

196
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,520
calls of all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their

197
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:29,040
right hand or in their foreheads, and that no man might buy or sell, save that he had the mark,

198
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,480
or the name of the beast, or the number of his name, and here is wisdom. Let him that have

199
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,760
understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is

200
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:46,400
603 score and six. So that's where it comes from. It's funny that you were talking about all this, um,

201
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,240
pit chip in the arm, idea for episode 665, don't know whether you actually did that to the

202
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:59,840
divinity, but there you go. 666 is there, the idea of having a chip, or a mark implanted into you,

203
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,160
and you'd not have to buy or sell without it, maybe there's something to that Revelation.

204
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,320
Oh, I like that one. That's a good one. That could start a whole conspiracy theory by itself.

205
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,160
Yeah, as it just coincidents, I started talking about this stuff from an episode 666 or

206
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,920
is there something else going on? You've got to read the book, clearly.

207
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,520
Yeah, all kinds of deception has been happening. That's a read legacy of astials. You'll see

208
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,040
the CIA, and this is from the government. The government has declassified all this paperwork,

209
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,080
you know, this is stuff from the 60s, and before that, even is now out in public domain,

210
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,600
the Freedom of Information Act has provided all this great information. You'll see that the U.S.

211
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,640
certainly has funded terrorists and guerilla movements and tried to start up rising,

212
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,640
and wars, and tried to have dictators killed, and we're not murderers, little bunch.

213
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,320
But of course, all of that ended. We don't do that anymore, do we? Ah, please.

214
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,760
So the only thing I will say is that while lots of people are sending me links to proof to

215
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:12,880
to counter what zeitgeist the movie is saying, why is it that people who are

216
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:21,440
trying to prove evil and conspiracies have all this great video footage of public and

217
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,560
commercial broadcasters that they're able to edit together yet, when someone goes into dispeel all

218
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:34,160
of this, you have to go buy a book like popular mechanics, by the way, part of the herst corporation.

219
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,640
So, you know, a couple people have pointed me to popular mechanics and their study, and

220
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,200
they've got lots of big red words to say fact. But you know, I'm looking for like the video evidence.

221
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,960
I love the video evidence. We live in the video age if you can't show me the video,

222
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,280
or if you're competing against the video, trying to prove a point, you're just going to lose.

223
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,480
Is that simple? But again, I'm not into conspiracy. I'm just saying let's follow the money. Let's

224
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,360
keep our eye on stuff. Uh, it's another book I need to read, uh, head CS sales. We still

225
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,400
crystal me. I need to read the Roth child, uh, which of course is one of the big families, which

226
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:16,080
uh, could possibly maybe maybe be out to expand their empire and influence. Yeah, never, no, do

227
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:24,560
you. A couple of people sent in comments about the TSA, the, uh, transport safety administration.

228
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,560
I think it's a administration agency. Agency, I believe, part of Homeland Security.

229
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,480
Yeah, I thought I had it bad by having to go, uh, go through a kind of a minor, not so, or not so

230
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,480
pleasant experience. Think about people who do this shit professionally.

231
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,240
Hey, Adam is a Robin. Yes, I'm on my way back to the airport for no trip. Well, I can say

232
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:56,720
about the TSA. Welcome to my world, over and over and over, sometimes more than once a day.

233
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,360
The last thing I got jacked up on was the MM50. I take that with me on trips, and uh,

234
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:10,800
they didn't like seeing that in the X-ray machine. So anyway, I feel for you, but I'm living it tailings.

235
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,840
Robin is a, uh, is a captain on a major major US airline. So we have to go through that

236
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,240
crap every single day. Yeah, I can understand, welcome to your world indeed. But still,

237
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,840
you get to sit in that cockpit, man, and fly. I have to tell you, I'm dreaming about it again.

238
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,880
I really, really am. I, you know, I feel so good now in the aircraft. I've really gotten to a

239
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,760
point where I'm, uh, I'm just, I'm feeling, I'm not overconfident, but I'm feeling confident. I still

240
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,160
have great respect for particularly mother nature. Yesterday showed me that again. But I just, yeah,

241
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,280
just, I'm, I'm wearing my plane, which is kind of, I guess the way it should feel. Oh,

242
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,640
that new thing I bought that, uh, the, uh, what is it, uh, portable collision avoidance system?

243
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,480
It works pretty well. Um, I didn't even expect it to pick up military aircraft, but, uh, indeed,

244
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,040
um, see it was flying just over the last bit of Germany before hitting the Netherlands and, uh,

245
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:18,800
a Tomahawk launched. Was it Tomahawk? I think it, not a cruise missile. I think it was a

246
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,000
Tomahawk anyway. Some kind of jet fighter. And, uh, so he was launching right underneath me.

247
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,560
And, uh, and I could pick him up. So he, I didn't realize that those guys had some kind of

248
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:35,360
squawk as well. So I could follow him for about, uh, 3.2 seconds before it's like blasted out.

249
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,000
And, uh, pretty amazing. Yeah, I guess my problem with, uh, with TSA is, you know, I don't mind

250
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,560
airport security. Of course I don't. But when it's stupidity, you know, so here's Robin,

251
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,960
he gets nailed for an MM50, which is one of the first, was one of the first advertisers we had

252
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,160
on the pod show network two years ago. It's a docking station from a Logitech that you, uh, that you

253
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,080
could put an iPod into. Uh, and it's just a metal docking station. You know, and meanwhile,

254
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,800
I'm passing through, you know, they're pulling out my hair gel. Well, I've got transmitters,

255
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:12,560
transceivers. I mean, I could actually jam the radio communications of any flight that I'm on,

256
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,080
because I carry so much shit in my bag. You know, I, and I'm licensed to carry it. I'm a licensed pilot.

257
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,120
I'm licensed to carry my transceiver, you know, and I, I carry along for a number of different

258
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,560
reasons, uh, mainly come too lazy to unpack my entire bag. So, you know, think about that. I could,

259
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,000
I could jam the entire communication system of the plane. Uh, yeah, that's okay. And by the way,

260
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and please take your lighter as well. But, whoa, as me, if you try to take some hair gel.

261
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,560
Hi, this is Sam from San Francisco Bay Area again. Uh, I got cut off. But I was just saying,

262
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,760
you know, when the TSA started, um, they were smart about a few things. They got rid of the stupid

263
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,520
security questions, which never made any sense. It never really accomplished anything. But then,

264
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,320
this stupid liquid thing is the dumbest thing. And I've lost all respect for the TSA with this

265
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,520
liquid crap. There's no way that someone is going to blow up a plane carrying a diet,

266
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:15,680
cober juice box on a plane. And it's completely eliminate my ability to go to go somewhere with

267
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,120
only carry on bags. Oh, you know, that is so true. That, that's the biggest problem I'd have to

268
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,800
say. Think about the time that we're wasting, not just by these, and, you know, long, uh, security lines,

269
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:33,600
which actually are move, I haven't been, okay. So that experience I had from New York to San Francisco,

270
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,200
Suck, then I almost missed my flight. But in general, I have not missed the flight, and I don't

271
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,280
give a shit. I'm, you know, I'm just in zombie mode anyway. But you, you literally, you can't travel

272
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,880
with just hand luggage anymore. You know, so that does take more time. It just takes time to load

273
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,200
stuff up. And of course, there are people that have to then have stuff loaded at the gate. And,

274
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,080
uh, it's debilitating. It really is. And it's okay if we're going to keep to some certain rules.

275
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:05,600
But be consistent. I opened my bag in, uh, in Frankfurt. And there was a, at the bottom of the bag.

276
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,640
They must have missed this. There was a huge canister of hair, a canister of hair spray. So I don't

277
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,400
mind, you know, them putting in their rules and everything. But be fucking consistent and do your job.

278
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,880
So now you're just not doing your job, okay? You suck. Um, and it's just,

279
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:30,080
to most annoying thing possible on airline. So I don't think the TSA has any scientific or any kind of,

280
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:38,480
any good reason why this could ban makes any sense. And I don't think anyone could blow up a plane

281
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:47,600
with a stupid 10-ounce bottle of anything. So as far as I'm concerned, the TSA is full of crap.

282
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,360
So of course it actually never even happened. You know, it was a, it was a threat that was thwarted.

283
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:02,480
I'm willing to believe that. Uh, but there was no actual, uh, explosion created by mixing of liquids

284
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,120
on an aircraft. Ah, let me get off of this. I don't care. I'm flying myself.

285
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,440
You know, it doesn't bother me anymore. I take all my liquids on board, my own plane. I love it.

286
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,880
Had a really good time in Germany. Um, I didn't stay in Darmstadt this time. Stayed, uh,

287
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:29,760
in Frankfort at the, oh, great hotel. The Villa Kennedy, which is on the, uh, the Kennedy Hala.

288
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,600
Um, beautiful, beautiful. But man, I tell you, first of all, you fly over Germany. It is just

289
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,200
absolutely stunningly beautiful. And the sun, the, the couple times have been that the sun is always shining.

290
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,160
But, um, gosh, they, they really know how to, uh, it's something about the German culture.

291
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,040
They really, they are perfectionists. And, uh, the people that we've been, uh, been working with

292
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,120
rattle from will, um, you know, these are just great guys, you know, and then they really want to get

293
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,160
shit done and, and do it right. And I have to say, feels very, um, the work ethic, uh, and dedication

294
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:15,760
feels, um, uh, it's, uh, exemplary. I'd have to say. So it looks like, um,

295
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,440
Podshow Germany will launch in Berlin first. Now, we, we have a couple of options. There's, uh,

296
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,760
and I, and I have learned even though I'd like to get a really cool funky office like we

297
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,320
have in the in London. Man, it's really difficult to get infrastructure if you need phones and

298
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,160
good connectivity. I'm not talking about a DSL line, but something, you know, that we can really

299
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:41,040
use for, for big-ass media files. It's tough. It takes a long time, um, even in the UK, even our

300
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,120
part of here British telecom couldn't, couldn't help us, you know, move things along any faster

301
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,960
because, you know, the roads had to open up and shit. So that's not, uh, that's not really something

302
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,320
that we're going to go for. So there's a couple of business, um, housing opportunities. The Berlin

303
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,360
one, there's actually a Twin Towers in Berlin, which I'd find to be just too static and, yeah,

304
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:08,000
however, a Pulse dump, which is just to the west kind of south west of Berlin. Now, that's a pretty

305
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,320
funky place. And there's some awesome, uh, independent labels, new media companies. There's a lot of

306
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,960
stuff going on over there. So, uh, that's probably where we're going to wind up starting the office.

307
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,760
And I'd say, um, in the new year, we'll probably be, uh, be ready to go. So, uh, very, very excited about

308
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,520
this. And, uh, in the next few weeks, now, we'll be, uh, I'll come up in, uh, in Germany. I guess,

309
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,520
we'll, we'll kind of centralize the meetings to Berlin, kind of what we did here in the UK with

310
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:42,320
our draft and darts. Um, we'll, uh, do a, uh, be on Broadway. And let's talk about some podcast.

311
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Hey, Adam, what's good, man? This is Major and Jay Mack and Fro, man, the staff over here at

312
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,800
hoodhive.com. Just want to say what's up to you, man. Uh, thanks for all the support you've been

313
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,440
showing us. And uh, we just want to let you know to, or we'll have to, uh, listeners know that they

314
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,360
can go to hoodhive.com slash vote and get in the vote for us over for the VH1 hip hop honors award.

315
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,000
We're nominated for best underground website, underground hip hop website. And really,

316
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,320
I mean, this is a big thing for us is big for podcasting in general. We're the only podcast

317
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,360
up there, too, by the way. Yeah, we're, everybody else is just doing the typical, you know, hip

318
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,080
hop website thing. We got a podcast and we're proud of that trying to take the podcast movement

319
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,640
even further. So any hope, any help you could give us, and that regard with the folks.

320
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:39,520
Hope and hope you help. Yeah, definitely, man. So, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I'm going to keep

321
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,720
plugging these guys because I really want them to win. Uh, you know, take that into consideration

322
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:51,760
that this is, uh, the best underground website. Um, and it's got to be hoodhive without a doubt

323
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,280
for the VH1 honors gover to hoodhive.com and find out how you can vote for them. I guess the

324
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,880
voting's done online. So, uh, whereas I typically hate these types of things. If it's a VH1 thing,

325
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,600
come on. Let's go spam those guys. Let's make hoodhive win so that they can mention me in their

326
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,200
acceptance speech. You know, everyone, uh, how, you know, at these award shows, I want to thank

327
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:22,400
God, you know, as long as you just slip my name in, that'll be good. Uh, let's see, uh, of course,

328
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,600
now that we're turning up the heat, uh, on a German friends, cross the border there, questions

329
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,760
are coming in. Edmhy, this is Michael, listener from Germany. I have a technical question about

330
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:43,280
pot-safe music. Um, here in Germany, there are a free radio, so we call free radio's and also

331
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:50,000
free television, um, broadcasters. They're funded by the state, basically, or they get federal money,

332
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,960
or whatever. Usually, they use gamma license, music, because they have a general gamma license,

333
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,960
or maybe. Yeah, that's, uh, that's a German version of the ASCAP BMI. Uh, so I do have a little

334
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,520
bit of knowledge of this. Let's see what the question where it leads. If would. Now, those free

335
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:18,000
radios and free TV broadcasters want to go online, and they want to use podcasts for some of their

336
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:26,960
content. My question is, let me back up a little bit. Um, they asked Gamma if, um, they could use

337
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,920
gamma music on their, or yeah, gamma music on material on their podcast. Gamma says, on streams,

338
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:42,240
yes, on podcast, no. Yeah. In other words, they cannot use gamma music, gamma license music on

339
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:49,760
their podcast. So my question is, is it possible for these broadcasters, both television and free

340
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:58,560
radio to use pot-safe music and under which conditions? Is it the general CC license, do they have to,

341
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,960
uh, say, okay, this is the artist that we play from and link to him. Is that all it takes or is there

342
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,160
other any additional things that needs to be taken into account? Yeah, thank you very much. Yeah,

343
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,320
and uh, I'll listen to the show like that. Thank you. I guess you will. Yeah, so there's of course,

344
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,520
uh, I'm not a lawyer and there's all kinds of opinions and uh, and there's no jurisprudence,

345
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,840
there's no precedence and it's very complicated. So in general, of course, that is the entire

346
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,440
point of the pot-safe music network is every person who uploads their music there has the rights

347
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,360
in one form another to actually do that and uh, gives you, um, producers and podcasters

348
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,160
who are associated with the network who have uh, signed up to the pot-safe music license,

349
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,680
gives you the right to do just that, uh, to uh, to use that work in all kinds of derivatives,

350
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,800
which would include a podcast. Now, um, in uh, many European countries and I believe it's still

351
00:29:52,800 --> 00:30:00,400
the same in Germany, um, the the Gemma, the Golf Echo Mike Alpha, which is their Ask God BMI,

352
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,960
has almost a God-given right. Once you uh, sign up with them and and let them handle the

353
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,960
performance royalties for your work, uh, no one else can be assigned that right, which is kind of

354
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:20,800
twisted, um, now in the US and in other countries around the world, you can always write out a separate

355
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:26,400
license for your music. So I don't know if it really would be enforceable if it went to court.

356
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:33,440
I do know that right now, there's a huge con-con-troversy, uh, going on in the Netherlands,

357
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,400
where yet another rights organization, the Saina Sierra Echo November Alpha, which interestingly

358
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,240
enough, uh, goes after rights of the artists who perform the work. Yeah, it gets crazier.

359
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,280
Uh, they've sent bills to the public broadcasters who've been putting out their radio shows as

360
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,920
podcasts and I'm in significant bills like totally up to maybe 100,000 euros, which as you know,

361
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,120
these days is about eight million dollars. So, um, you know, this has led all the public broadcasters

362
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,280
to stop putting their shows out as podcasts, which of course sucks. And the reason why they will

363
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,960
allow it, uh, streaming, which, of course, again in the States now costs a significant amount of money,

364
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,360
or at least that's what the latest word was. It's all still very, very confusing.

365
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:26,080
Um, you know, it's because they think that you can't copy it, or that people, it's too much

366
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,640
hassle for people to go copy stuff off of streams. When it comes right down to, of course,

367
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:38,000
don't get a shit about copying your crappy music, but that regulation does allow us to do some

368
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,560
very, very interesting things ourselves at Pod Show. Hey, I'm direct, you know, how been like

369
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:50,960
you since, I mean, way back to some use even the cards. But anyway, so, you know, I've been

370
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,320
paying attention that I gotta say I didn't do this one coming. Um, some of you pop it around on the

371
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:03,120
internet and if I hit bookmarks and I go to curie.com and, and I hit your link and it takes me to

372
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:11,200
what is it? Plus TV, is up plus TV.com? Dude, I think you got something here.

373
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:22,800
And see this one coming. I meant to it. Yeah, blue pill. Okay, keep on the blue pill then. Yeah,

374
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,520
this is, so this is, this hasn't even officially launched and I just kind of mapped to go

375
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,560
daddy domain name to it. Oh, by the way, if you're looking for a great deal on a go on a domain name,

376
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:38,720
just go to godaddy.com and use my checkout code, DSC3 for 10% discount across the board and whatever

377
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:46,160
you buy. So I mapped the plus TV.com to our test, which we'll really start ramping up the first

378
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:53,840
of October as we will be broadcasting live from backstage at the digital music awards at the

379
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,800
roundhouse in London. Those of you who are listening, well, no, we did this last year. This year,

380
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:07,040
it's a little bit different. So we've built this system, which I'm very proud of. L to the A,

381
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,080
Lisa has really set this up all by herself under my direction, but God, she's been working on it

382
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:19,520
for six, that will maybe eight or nine months. So we, we have this entire scheduling system,

383
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,080
which is very familiar to me, because it works very similar to that of a, of a radio station.

384
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,680
And we've automated a whole bunch of video that can run through this thing and, and it's on 24,

385
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:37,360
and it's, uh, it's great video music videos. It's a wacky crazy single clip videos. It shows,

386
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,200
all of it has been cleared and run through the pods, the pod show network. So it's all above board.

387
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,200
And of course, because it is streaming, we're actually going to be able to roll out some of the

388
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,480
videos of the, the artists who are nominated for the digital music award. So October 1st, you're

389
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,760
going to see us ramping this up, then October 2nd when the awards take place, we'll be coming to

390
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,040
live backstage, uh, truly is your backstage pass to the digital music awards. How do I know it's

391
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:09,760
going to be the best backstage pass? Well, because we have a free bar, uh, inside the venue, where

392
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,000
our kind of our areas, our stage, our set. And I know one thing for sure, when you want to get musicians

393
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,600
on camera to interview, all you have to do is say, uh, the bar is over here. And that, of course,

394
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,800
is where we have most of the cameras set up. So that'll be fun. Uh, so that kicks off 4 p.m.

395
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:33,440
UK time, uh, which would be about 8 a.m. San Francisco time. Uh, the whole, the shabang lasts about

396
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,080
eight hours. So around midnight, UK time or 1 a.m. We're going to start, we're going to repeat

397
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,560
everything that took place. So those of you, uh, just waking up in the states will be able to, uh,

398
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,200
to witness it. And we'll keep going all the way through, uh, the day after the DMAs, uh, with the,

399
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,760
you know, red carpet. We've got everyone's going to be their Dr. Cockney, OJ, uh,

400
00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:00,000
Nadda.Contin's coming over. Uh, I might even do stuff on camera. But it's, it's going to be fun.

401
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,880
And it's going to be something different. Uh, so this is, you know, someone, someone picked it

402
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,200
up the other day and said, yeah, that, you know, the plus TV dot com, it's kind of, it's kind of like

403
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,800
what, you know, MTV might have been today if they hadn't gone to all the, the long-form programming.

404
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,080
I'm like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

405
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:25,520
Adam, it's being on desert, um, just listening to the DSE and your playing that could, from, uh,

406
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,360
network. And uh, it's kind of reminds me of something different. Ninth, uh, always getting around

407
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:39,360
about it's, uh, little factoid, uh, yeah, that we kind of made up. Basically, it's 1% of the population

408
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:47,760
thinks, 2% of the population think that they think. The other 97% of the population would rather die

409
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:57,440
than think. Think about it. Thanks, bye. Hmm. That's a good one. I might have to write that down.

410
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,840
Let me think about it.

411
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,400
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Gamesweasel. On this week's show, we get plumbing with superpaper mario on the

412
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,440
Wii, but he's very thin this time. We've also got a review of his rivals game, Sonic Rush adventure

413
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,240
on the DS. We've got part two of our Star Wars, the Force Unleashed feature, and you can win

414
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:27,120
copies of Juice 2 for the Xbox 360. That's all on Gamesweasel. To be found at gamesweasel.beteepotshow.com.

415
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:33,520
Soon to be in video version, uh, right now it's audio. Matt Cuddle, the award nominated

416
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,600
for uh, was a GMA, a games media award, awesome dude. Congratulations again. I hope we'll be

417
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,200
awesome if you want it. It's up against some big mainstream properties. It doesn't you live

418
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,600
in the UK, uh, ratios about 20% to 80 from the U.S. So step up the Colin will you let's

419
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,640
didn't expect to get any more comments about my, uh, my iPhone that dropped down the

420
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,080
throat of the porcelain beast, but yep, it is. Hey Adam, I have a question about your iPhone.

421
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,880
After it landed in the toilet, did it sink? So I had to think about this question for

422
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,680
second because I'm like, what does he mean? Did it sink? Of course it sank. It sank to the bottom of

423
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,760
the toilet, but more interesting, um, after I dried it out and stuck it in kitty litter, which is

424
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,680
really true, by the way, people who thought that it might not have actually happened.

425
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,280
It did come back to life. It does sink if that's the kind of sinking you were talking about,

426
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:48,080
uh, but the touchscreen is forever host. Uh, but I'll say it again. I'm not missing it.

427
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:54,320
I missed the pinch technique, but all things, all things remaining the same, the combination from

428
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,800
me of the N800, um, and the E61I. Yes, it's two devices. Yes.

429
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:10,240
Yeah, there's, there's that kind of drawback. Yes, the kind of, um, industrial feeling. Boy,

430
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,520
you can toss those fuckers around. I've dropped these things so many times, uh, and they just

431
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,480
work and they've got everything. Almost everything that I could wish for is working on these two

432
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,080
devices combined. So, uh, I guess I'm, uh, I'm kind of red pilling for, uh, for Nokia there.

433
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,720
Let's do one more comment about, uh, about the evilness of the world and then we'll play another

434
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:37,680
awesome song. Okay, what do you say? Hey Adam, uh, this is JT. Uh, I had to say it bad. You're starting

435
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:46,400
to sound like a really paranoid Democrat, which, uh, stop a really paranoid Democrat. The

436
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,440
fuck you, first of all. You know, I'm, I'm not a Republican or Democrat. I probably lean more

437
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,840
towards Republican than Democrat if you really thought about it, um, but why, why would a Democrat,

438
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,400
why does that have to be a Democrat's thoughts at all? You know, the Democrat right now

439
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:09,360
can suck my dick. You know, it's, big talk, big, big talk, but where's all your power? Where

440
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:16,080
are you changing things? You can't, you know, you should, there's a lot, you know, please, please, please.

441
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:22,320
I'm so disappointed in government in general. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, they're all sucking on the same

442
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:32,000
straws. Trust me. Okay. So, you know, that, that type of name calling, I just will not accept.

443
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,040
It's just ridiculous. I'm an American. I'm a world citizen. Uh, I, I'm concerned and I think

444
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:46,240
and we can have a discussion, but the call me a, a paranoid Democrat screw you. Uh, I know you have

445
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,240
Republican tendencies. So, uh, don't mean that as an insult, just that you're just getting all

446
00:39:52,240 --> 00:40:01,520
back down there. Um, I understand and believe that there is a, uh, definitely, uh, a, a lot of

447
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:08,960
blue pill in the media. And yes, we have been told what they want to know and write down to the reality

448
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,760
TV shows or whatever you want to call them. And uh, the news and all that I can understand and

449
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,280
believe that. Right. Okay. Well, it's not the entire point. And, and, and by the way,

450
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,920
it's just the way the media is made. It's, you know, the whole, the whole point of television is to trick you.

451
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,960
You know, what's, what's Zoom? What's a jump cut? What's a, what's a, what's a fade? It's all,

452
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:40,160
effects, effects by definition are things that can't happen in reality. Uh, I do not believe

453
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,160
that the media is, you know, encouraged with the government. If they were, they wouldn't be

454
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,760
trying to put people out of Iraq. I don't, I, you know, I really don't think that I said that,

455
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:59,840
you know, the government and the media are in codes. I, you know, um, but is it a fact, a historical

456
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,320
fact that the US government has been in Kahoots with certain influential journalists? Absolutely.

457
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,640
And that happens in the commercial sector, too. Look at the, uh, look at the correlation

458
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,480
between Apple and the Wall Street Journal, Steve Jobs and Wald Mossberg. Come on, you know,

459
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,000
you can't tell me that there's no relationship there. Yeah. Of course, Wald has his integrity,

460
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,640
but you know, there's, there's ways to massage these guys. I, I try it all the time.

461
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,840
If you're journalists and you'd like to be massage by the pod father, just give me a jangle.

462
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:41,200
Find a sabotage the troops that are over there. 12 of the, uh, the one government, uh, one

463
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:48,320
world government. I say that's a good thing as long as it's consensual. Now, it's by Conquest. Yeah,

464
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:54,880
that's not a good thing. I don't believe that they're, and I think it's a conspiracy, but, um,

465
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,400
I definitely don't believe that there is a, uh, uh, that, that it's bankers and, um,

466
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:07,760
you know, all of the rich families that are pulling strings and trying to get us into Iraq

467
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,120
and Iran and all of that. Okay. So this, this, I think really is the point that I have to

468
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:20,880
disagree with you because historically, throughout mankind's history, the rich, the powerful,

469
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,760
have always, always tried to protect our own, our own backs, our own families.

470
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,120
You know, when you got a lot of money, you got a lot more to lose, I guess. And, you know, it's all

471
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:39,040
relatives, but come on. This has been going on. What do you think that the royal family here in the

472
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:46,240
UK, they're so influential that they can sit on on UK taxpayers' pounds and have all these

473
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,600
castles and not do anything. And it'll do anything. You know, I think they're important for

474
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:57,360
Britishness and for the culture, but they don't actually do anything. I don't even know how much they

475
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:04,240
own, but you can't tell me that that's not because they have some form of influence. And, you know,

476
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,160
if it, come on. So we have our own version of that in the US. We have our own royalty.

477
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:21,760
And we all know that we worship the dollar. We've even combined the dollar with the Lord in God

478
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:29,600
we trust. It's on our money. So I totally believe that bankers are in charge. This, by the way,

479
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:36,560
would be a good reason to look into Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign from what I understand

480
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,760
I have not done the research myself, but I appreciate anyone who did from what I understand,

481
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:50,160
she is taking a lot of money from hedge funds, i.e. bankers. And these guys, they just don't

482
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,160
invest in stuff for no good reason. They invest to get it back. That's the whole way our system works.

483
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,600
You know, if you have enough money, you can buy enough TV commercials. You can get elected.

484
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,480
It's that give me $300 million. I'll be president tomorrow. And I just feel like

485
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:17,520
people are on edge about all of this and they are just paranoid. Yeah, okay. So we're allowed to be paranoid.

486
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:28,080
It's just, I understand that there are things that are not in our control and there are things that, you know,

487
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:33,680
I wish the government would be more secret about things because the nerve tells the public

488
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:39,520
the more it gets cut around, the more things we get, and the more it sabotages our efforts. There

489
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:50,400
is a terrorism issue. There is an Islamic, you know, radical Islamic uprising against the rest of the world.

490
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:57,120
And it's not going to go away. I don't think. We have to put that into

491
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,800
a situation where we can control it. I don't want to be in control of the word, but I do want to

492
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:11,840
control our state. And so that's something that we need to be aware of. And you cannot control your

493
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:21,680
fate, my friend. Look at Katrina. You cannot control fate. Now all I know is the most logical

494
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,120
reason for the United States and coalition. It's not just the United States that went in,

495
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:32,560
although they seem to be the only one staying as the world's policemen. The reason they went into

496
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,800
Iraq, thank you very much, Alan Greenspan for telling us now after you've left the federal reserve,

497
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:45,840
Cox Sucker, that it, oh, Iraq was all about oil. It does after everyone deflected that and

498
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,760
denied it. Here's a guy who's been on the inside circle for a long time.

499
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:59,600
Conscience catch up to you there, Alan. Of course it was about oil, but not about stealing oil.

500
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,160
It's about protecting the interests, our own interests, controlling our destiny.

501
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,200
And I believe the entire point was to provide stability in the region.

502
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,800
But I think the war machine got the better of us and the profits are soaring and

503
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:23,440
that God knows what I think the dollar is in many ways being kept artificially low, but that's just me.

504
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:30,080
So that was a complete control of your destiny move, but we were lied to.

505
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:36,640
And, you know, it's one thing to say, hey, look, we got to go into the Middle East because we got

506
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,120
to protect our interests and the world needs that oil and we need that oil and this is why we're

507
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,800
going in. That's one thing, but to lie about it and use the oldest tricks in the book. That's

508
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:55,280
fucking lame. And now to be to be standing there and watching a civil war take place.

509
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,600
That's there's something real wrong with that. That's finishes up.

510
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:11,760
I am definitely not a going back clone, but if you want to get a little there,

511
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,360
what I consider more reality, I think you're going back. That may say something about me,

512
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:24,080
but I, I didn't hear what you said. I got to do what?

513
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:31,520
I am definitely not a going back clone, but if you want to get a little there,

514
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:37,040
what I consider more reality, I think you're going back. That may say something about me,

515
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,320
but I, I, I, I, I believe. Anyway, I really wish I, I really wish I understood.

516
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:58,800
I, I, I don't, I don't know what you're saying there at the end, so I don't know what I'm supposed to

517
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,960
look at, but I'll gladly look at anything. And please send me some video montage as of stuff that

518
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,800
the, the dispels all of this and that, you know, we got to look at, is it all religion? Is that what

519
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,960
it comes down to? It's all about religion. There's nothing else. No one else has pissed anybody off.

520
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,120
There's been no back and forth. There's no huge financial gains or losses for any party anywhere in the

521
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,600
world. There could piss someone off. I, I really, I really, I really respectfully have to disagree with that.

522
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:36,160
Before I forget Julian Smith sent me a note for you to check out the alive and Baghdad video

523
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:42,320
podcast, which he says is probably the best political, political one around right now. Apparently

524
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:49,760
seriously short on funds. So they're taking donations alive in Baghdad.org. And if you don't

525
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:56,160
know how to spell Baghdad by now, well, then you can just go to the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

526
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,120
to find out how you spell that. Help to help the brother out there. He's doing some very interesting

527
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,080
stuff. I'm going to play one more song from the pod safe music network. Do,

528
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,720
I'll be back with a final thought before I get out of here and I've got to go to London once again

529
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:16,080
today and Chicago tomorrow. So it's a cha cha in movement.

530
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:43,520
And I vow right now to last time I get in. So to commemorate, I go out and tie one on.

531
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:54,080
I guess I'll quit drinking when you're gone. If I put off jail tomorrow, what I want to get

532
00:49:54,080 --> 00:50:02,640
today? I'll just sit here till the future. Come and slap me in the face. If it don't change my

533
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:10,720
direction and I'll blow it out here in space then you can't say that I've ever lost my way.

534
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:32,960
Do, do, do, do, do, do. At least I thought that's what I told myself I'd do. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

535
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:41,360
Then in a cloud of smoke, my car moved to LA. My girlfriend got pulled away.

536
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:51,520
But if I put off jail tomorrow, what I want to get today? Come on, I'll just sit here till the future.

537
00:50:51,520 --> 00:51:04,480
Come and slap me in the face. If it don't change my direction and I'll blow it out here in space then you can't say that I've ever lost my way.

538
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:51,520
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

539
00:51:51,520 --> 00:52:21,520
do, do, do, do, do do, do, do, do, do, do, don, do, do, do, do, do,

540
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:32,520
But don't change my directions, and I've blown out here in space, and then you can't say that I've ever lost my way.

541
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,520
Nashville's favorite song, and you can't say that I've ever lost my way.

542
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,520
Matthew Ebel's back, we lost my way, brand new on the pot, say anything that worked, you can find a link to that in the show,

543
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,520
no, it's a daily source code dot com.

544
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,520
Hey, I'm coming to Nashville around mid-October.

545
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,520
I'm hoping that I'll have some time to hang out.

546
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,520
So far, these business trips have been pretty unlucky for hooking up with people.

547
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:01,520
So, of course, Berlin is going to be a big one in a couple weeks, and then that'll probably be just before Nashville.

548
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,520
You see, see what my life has become.

549
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,520
I'm like a fucking travel in gypsy.

550
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:11,520
Now, since I have to go to Chicago tomorrow, I have a speech on Thursday.

551
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,520
Here's what I was thinking.

552
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,520
I was thinking, why don't I hop a plane?

553
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,520
I already have way there.

554
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:28,520
Why don't I hop a plane over to California and then head on up to the portable media expo, which I didn't go to last year?

555
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,520
And really, I just like to hook up with people.

556
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:37,520
As all these people who I've known for a couple of years now, some of them I've never met.

557
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,520
I'd love to be meeting them, new people.

558
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,520
I think we've got a couple of party suites going on.

559
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,520
Quite sure Richard Brewer Hay is setting everything up this year.

560
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:58,520
I hope that we'll also be demoing some of the new Pod Show site, which is not really slated to be released until I'd say end of November, beginning of December.

561
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,520
That's when we can start doing some data stuff.

562
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,520
It's very, very different.

563
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:07,520
So, as we move more towards, actually, I have a description for you.

564
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,520
You're going to like this.

565
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,520
It seems for the internet meets LinkedIn for media.

566
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,520
