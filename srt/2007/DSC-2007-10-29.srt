Welcome to DSC 6-7-8.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But it's not a food bar Friday, isn't it?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Not that we're better or angry?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Welcome to DSC 6-7-8.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We're happy it's here.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We just wish it was a food bar Friday, like you promised.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On 67, right Adam?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Welcome to DSC 6-7-8.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A train on a hero's in the fire,

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
cos it will go super close.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There are always the ones that love you,

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
most love you most love you most.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Your love alone is not enough,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
not enough, not enough.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's what you've felt.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's what you said, what you said, what you said.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You said the sky would fall on you,

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
on you, on you, on you.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Through all the pain all right, stay blue.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They say blue, baby blue.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But you love alone, say no more.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You look at the secret of the universe.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Despite all you made it worse.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It left you lonely.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And it has to come.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You stole the sun.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sweet from my heart, from my heart, from my heart.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We've no excuses.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You fell apart, fell apart, fell apart.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Know you won't make a mess.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I've been messing me, messing me.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
For your respite, messing me.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't be, I can't be.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I could just sing for miles and miles.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I couldn't make you feel alive.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I could have placed us in the sun.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I could have ridden all your life.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I could have shown you, I could have shown you.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I could have tried.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If you love alone, say no more.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you love alone, say no more.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I could have shown you.

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, that's the soundtrack of your life.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Man, it's great creatures, they're from Wales.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How would be in the United Kingdom as well?

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Your love alone is not enough.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you live in the United Kingdom, you've probably heard that song before.

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It is now officially on the Podsake Music Network.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It was, isn't that the girl from the Cardigans?

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This has been a big hit over here in the UK.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now officially available for your own independent productions to the Podsake Music Network.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It is daily source code, episode number 678 coming to you from partially overcast

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Guilford, that is of course the affluent suburb of Surrey in the Curry Manor.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I hope you had a good weekend.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, I didn't get to the Friday food bar festivities.

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There was really food bar.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It had to make a quick trip to the hospital, which delayed the whole day.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Luckily, it had already completed the first episode of No Agenda with John C. Dvorak,

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
which is at noagenda.podshow.com.

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The show is exactly what it sounds like.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No Agenda.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But people are already tuning into it.

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's pretty cool.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And by the way, don't ask me to put it in my daily source code feed because I think that's

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
a mistake.

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've tried that over the past several years.

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
People don't like that.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's got its own feed.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Or if you subscribe to Curry.com, you might have gotten the episode automatically.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So has this ever happened to you where you wake up on a Sunday morning?

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's a weekend.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And like, okay, what time is it here?

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh, man, we slept until 10.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
30.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This is pretty late for us.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Pick up the Nokia E61I.

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Turn it on because, of course, I want to lay in bed there leisurely.

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Listen to the Sunday morning love songs on BBC Radio 2.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This probably never happens to you, actually.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And John, the phone, I'm like, this is weird.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The phone is saying it's 9.30.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But it's 10.30.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And it took me about an hour to realize after resetting my clock,

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
then turning back on the network auto time update feature only to find the time was 9.30 again.

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Or at that point 9.40.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What the hell is going on?

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, of course.

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We fell back into the daylight savings time.

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So I said the Patricia said, hey, you know what?

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We got a whole extra hour.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Why don't we go into London?

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's go, let's go hang out.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Let's go to let's go shopping.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Ladies, don't you love it when your man says that?

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I actually said, let's go to herids.

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This of course was all, but a sli-ploy to sneak by

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
235 region street to the Apple store, which is not far from herids on Brompton.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Is it Brompton?

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's Brompton.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
To pick up, yes, I was going to make today the Big Mac is back attack.

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
To pick up a MacBook Pro.

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And today I was actually planning on running a cast blaster on Windows on my MacBook.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Of course things never go.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let's expect them to.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And I've been somewhat disappointed.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
First of all, we had a great, it was kind of like rainy, not really rain rain,

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
but that little fine mist that just kind of drizzles down on top of you

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
that makes you just as freaking wet.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We had a really nice time in London, just the two of us.

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh man, you know, at herids.

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And if you've never been to herids, this is an amazing department store.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
They have every massive major fashion brand known to man in this place.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And although, you know, I'm marginally into this.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Of course, it's the female version of my Mac porn.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And of course, we went to the Apple store first and you had to order it.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And man, are they just like handing this shit out there?

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There must be a thousand people in the store.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
As outrageous, they can't sell the shit fast enough.

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Anyway, so if you want to hear a memory upgraded, then they have to do that in the basement.

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So, oh, I said, I'll come back at the end of the day and get it.

128
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And that was my version of porn.

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Although I don't like having my porn with so many people in my proximity.

130
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And that was off to herids.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Man, oh my goodness.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You know, I, uh, I'm forcing, I know how clothes are made and what it really takes to do it

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and how fashion operates and, uh, what a rip off.

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I couldn't believe it.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The shoes.

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Now, I understand where you can get, you know, if you get a pair of Prada or Jimmy

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Choose or, um, you know, Chanel or, uh, you name it.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You know, there's a, there's a brand there.

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You're going to pay a premium.

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And, uh, look, if you're going to, if you, uh, want to buy those types of shoes,

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
you got to expect to spend four to 500 pounds.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's like a thousand dollars for shoes, which, by the way,

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
my, my wife rarely does.

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
She hates that she can't stand it.

145
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Now, I can understand when you got a brand like that.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And, you know, this shoes, you know, I held in my hand at looking around.

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It sniffed a little bit.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Uh, you know, you have the shoes with a red bottom, which is another thing

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
that everyone has to be wearing these days.

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Uh, the sole is completely red.

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You know, it's, um, I, I understand you pay the premium.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But even for brands that I, that I'd never heard of,

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
shoes, three, four, hundred pounds.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Sandals.

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Just a slab of leather would like a toe strap on it.

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There's 350 pounds, 700 bucks.

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What the fuck is going on?

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's how, that's how outrageous.

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And it's not just the, the, the brands that, you know,

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
that unsophisticated guys like, like myself know.

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I mean, there's all kinds of new brands that I've never heard of.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Even the harrow's house brand shoes are 400 pounds.

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What is going on?

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Uh, maybe that's a topic for Noah Gendus,

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
something I can, uh, can run by, uh,

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Dr. John C.

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Anyway, um,

168
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So, uh, came home and Patricia did buy a couple things.

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
She brought the new, uh, new trendy, uh, elbow high gloves.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That everyone's supposed to be wearing and some new pants.

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And yeah, we had a, we had a good little shopping trip.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That was really nice.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And, uh, of course, you know, I unpacked my porn.

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll unpack the, uh, the MacBook.

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And it has, uh, 10 OS 10 dot four installed.

176
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So then you have to do the upgrade.

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Probably three hours really configuring this thing.

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You know that, you know, you get your fresh Mac and first you got to upgrade to leopard

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and you go through that process.

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And then you got to install office, or at least I have to because we really,

181
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
you know, the power points really have to kind of be the same with the same font.

182
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So we, we do a lot of, uh, power points stuff for presentation to presentation

183
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
to advertisers.

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Uh, there's a burp coming, but it's a wet one.

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So I'll hold it in.

186
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Um, yeah.

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I installed the, I work, um, you know, uh,

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
did a little search to figure out how to synchronize my Nokia, uh,

189
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
E61 eye with eye cal, and then there's an eye cal with G cal,

190
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
seeing.

191
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So I'm doing all this stuff.

192
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And then, of course, I plug in my time machine backup drive.

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Everything's rolling right.

194
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm like, okay.

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This is great.

196
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So everything's installed.

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I've got everything set up the way I wanted to be.

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Uh, okay.

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's a time.

200
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, and of course, some, some updates ran in the background.

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You know, at least a 400 megs of updates, uh, to the OS,

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
which I'm thinking I'm probably should have installed those updates first

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
before going to leopard, at least that's what I'm about to attempt now

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
because you guessed it.

205
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Uh, when I rebooted, um, even though, you know, everything

206
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
had been installed, it kept coming up with the setup assistant.

207
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I could not get out of it.

208
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Even if I completed the setup assistant again,

209
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
it would start over with the setup assistant.

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I was like, fuck, you can't put Cooper,

211
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
you know, you're disappointing me again.

212
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What a lousy experience.

213
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't know.

214
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sure I was just trying to do too much at the same time,

215
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
but, you know, there's not like there's any instructions

216
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
in which order you're supposed to do this stuff.

217
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So this morning, I tried to recover.

218
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I could actually, I know a little bit about max,

219
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
so I get into command line and see what was there.

220
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And it seemed like I just couldn't figure out

221
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
how to get past the OSX assistant.

222
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
In fact, it was bringing up the 10.4 setup assistant.

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So I did what any other brave man would do, fuck it.

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Just erase the whole drive, start over from scratch.

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So I've got like 20 minutes left on the leopard install.

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Then I'm going to reboot and see if it actually

227
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
will go through that sequence before I start installing all my stuff again.

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Ah, luckily though, I got the dot max synchronization setup.

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So I think everything that I had already imported

230
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
because you know, you have to import your address.

231
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hello.

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Can I help you, babe?

233
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What, hold on a second.

234
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What?

235
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah.

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
When I'm done with the show, I hope.

237
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Bye.

238
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No one cares about the show.

239
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You don't care about the show.

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay, about the show.

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay.

242
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll help you later, babe.

243
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
She needs to send off documentation for a passport.

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And I have in the first passport for a driver's license.

245
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh, whoa, is me.

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
My kid's going to be driving an automobile.

247
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And it's time to change in my friends.

248
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You know they are.

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Forget around the world.

250
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Well, the winds have changed to blow in my friend.

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's time to elect a president again.

252
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'd love a spirit of debates.

253
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So I'd be ready for a wait.

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Let's get at them to get the candidate online.

255
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Come on, Adam.

256
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Get the message on the line.

257
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I really want to know what this stand for.

258
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I really want to know what the mean.

259
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Don't you crack the internet and rip it wide open.

260
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Know it's your vote and it's mine.

261
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It'll all be okay.

262
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
If I had my say, I'd love Adam to get the candidate online.

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Come on, Adam.

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Get the message on the line.

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yo.

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So the winds have changed our blowing through this show.

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Even I'm getting a little tired of the political talk.

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I do want to say a couple things.

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I got a whole bunch of responses to the Ron Paul interview from

270
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Daily Source code 677.

271
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
If you haven't heard it, you might want to go check it out.

272
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Here's just one I want to play for.

273
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This is Kevin and go from Florida.

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I just heard your interview with Ron Paul outstanding.

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Listen, here's the problem.

276
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm going to have red pill you my friend.

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay.

278
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The problem with Ron Paul, which isn't a problem, is that we're used to being sold to.

279
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We're used to being manipulated.

280
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We're used to being promoted, pushed.

281
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And Ron Paul's not about that.

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He's just laying it out there for you.

283
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He's, I guess you call it a data dump.

284
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
He's not pushing.

285
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He's not selling it.

286
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He's not promoting it.

287
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
He just is.

288
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It exists.

289
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And it is.

290
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And it always was.

291
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And he's just putting it out there.

292
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And that's why people are having a hard time accepting his message.

293
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But man, I'm right on.

294
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Because I hate being sold or promoted to.

295
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I mean, that's the deal.

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It is what it is.

297
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So hey, take care.

298
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Good interview.

299
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And have sex with you now.

300
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm not going to do that.

301
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But.

302
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah, I will.

303
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And November 5th, of course, I'll be donating my funds to the campaign.

304
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Interesting.

305
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
While I was installing all this shit, I was actually watching the GOP debates.

306
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I think it was someone posted on YouTube.

307
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And there was also a kind of like a compilation, which I don't like.

308
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I hate it when people do compilations about one candidate because it's pretty skewed.

309
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But anyway, there was a compilation of Ron Paul on Fox News after the debate where they had the results of their poll numbers.

310
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And Ron Paul, like stood above all candidates.

311
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Something like 35% approval in this poll.

312
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And it was so funny to watch the Fox News guys.

313
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's like, well, the poll is obviously fucked.

314
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You know, the poll isn't right.

315
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Or, you know, the deck is stacked because Ron Paul supporters are calling in more often than others or whatever it is.

316
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And I was like, well, because clearly they don't manipulate these polls.

317
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Otherwise, this couldn't have happened.

318
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But it was funny.

319
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And they were really doing everything to marginalize it saying the results were off.

320
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It was no good.

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And then Ron Paul got on.

322
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He's like, I love your Fox News audience.

323
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They're clearly very intelligent people.

324
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I was quite funny.

325
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I did learn something though that, you know, when they say,

326
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, how come you don't show up in the national polls?

327
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And apparently he's at least in most of them.

328
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He hasn't been listed as a candidate.

329
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But as a candidate that people can respond to.

330
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So I don't know, man.

331
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I think he, again, I think he had a really clear message.

332
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And I think that the Republican Party outside of, you know,

333
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
what was in the audience in Florida, which apparently included,

334
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
it was like 3,000 people.

335
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Giuliani got 1,000 free tickets.

336
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So a lot of Giuliani supporters.

337
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This thing is all, what this whole system is messed up, man.

338
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's really messed up.

339
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But you will be advertised to about Ron Paul,

340
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
because that's what it's going to start doing with this 5 million

341
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
box.

342
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's going to start advertising.

343
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So hopefully he'll do it with the message.

344
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And for you, my friend, just called in,

345
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
maybe the radio isn't for you.

346
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Maybe radio advertising isn't for you.

347
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Maybe you should just be sticking to independent media.

348
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Hey Adam, Rob Cohn from Western Canada.

349
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Just commenting on your view, the world rugby championships there

350
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
as my old rugby coach.

351
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah, you know, this is, this is my amazement that England versus South Africa

352
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
in the world championships for rugby.

353
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
England lost even though there was a try,

354
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
which is the equivalent of a touchdown or a goal.

355
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That did not count after a video review because the player was out of bounds.

356
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But everyone kind of, you know, it's like orderly.

357
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
All right, shit, we lost.

358
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That really sucks.

359
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We're devastated.

360
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
We're guided.

361
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But no fighting in the stands.

362
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You know, no one's beating each other up.

363
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So what did your coach use to say?

364
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
rugby is a barbarian sport played by gentlemen and soccer,

365
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
aka football is a talent sport played by barbarians.

366
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I just thought you might enjoy that.

367
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And of course, fuck you Adam Kurt.

368
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
God, thank you.

369
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yo, you know what I got to say that I think probably a lot

370
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
of the England football supporters are also England rugby supporters.

371
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So what is it about the game?

372
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What is it about the situation that changes that?

373
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Very interesting to me.

374
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I even though I want to stay away from a lot of the political talk today.

375
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
When this guy calls in, you just can't ignore him.

376
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Let's have a word with the nylon.

377
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Spreading the news with the smile on where the roll is right.

378
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So you'd think, of course, that the nylon would call in be completely

379
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
contrary and say all kinds of shit about the Ron Paul interview about me about

380
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
the show about how much I suck and you know what?

381
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You're right.

382
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Hey Adam, it's the nylon backed by unparalleled demand.

383
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Let's go to the chasing here with Dr. No.

384
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There used to be a day when, you know, you'd walk into a bowling

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
close to curtain, pull the lever and walk out and no one asks you what happened

386
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
back there.

387
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Let's go back to those days.

388
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't really care who you're interested in.

389
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You're mind that your opinions aren't relevant to me.

390
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Maybe just some of the listeners and they're probably relevant to your new

391
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
so-called listeners from the Ron Paul campaign.

392
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You know, that is a good point that nylon makes there.

393
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I recall back in the day when I was just a young girl.

394
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Come on, sit on Grand Paul Adams knee here. I'll tell you a story.

395
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
When I was, I don't know, 5, 6, 7 years old living in the States.

396
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I recall very vividly that people would not talk about whether who they were going to vote

397
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
for or what party affiliation they have.

398
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That definitely changed over the years.

399
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

400
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I think debate and talking about stuff is always good.

401
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And, you know, if you have a viewpoint, I guess it's going to match up with a candidate

402
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
or you'll bring in a candidate.

403
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't know. I understand where you're coming from on that nylon.

404
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But I think it's kind of good that we're all talking about our choices and our ideas and our thoughts.

405
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And it's, you know, we're from the outside.

406
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It may look like, oh, there's a red state blue state and sometimes inside the United States

407
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
as a red state blue state vibe.

408
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But in general, no one gives a shit.

409
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Who are all just Americans?

410
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Who are found a willing sucker in you for their version of one rest of the charts?

411
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I guarantee you, if you stop supporting Ron Paul, stop supporting Steve Kobair,

412
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
which I'm sure that'll be the next thing.

413
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You'll lose those listeners there.

414
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Look, first of all, I don't, you know, I don't make this to gain or lose listeners.

415
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I presume people listen or they don't listen.

416
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And you, let me tell you, I'm a big fan of lots of shows, lots of radio programs.

417
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You just can't listen to everything.

418
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But this, you know, I'll never listen again.

419
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Fine, man.

420
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't buy any of that.

421
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And this is not about winning or losing listeners.

422
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's about doing my show.

423
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And by the way, Steve Kobair is actually more internet savvy than Ron Paul.

424
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So let's move to that one and bore me.

425
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Now, don't worry.

426
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
No danger of that.

427
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So, by the way, this whole thing about bummer is to chill it.

428
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Let's get over this.

429
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
First of all, bummer is the chart.

430
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What are you talking about?

431
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
If you're talking about November 5th, that, you know, Ron Paul supporters are all going to start donating money on November 5th to move the needle.

432
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Which I do believe works.

433
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I said bummer, I said charts.

434
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's, I don't, I don't, I hope they're not calling it that.

435
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Boy, as you know, Joseph Jaffey invented that.

436
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Didn't move.

437
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You're still counting the payments to get WPP or Coke or Johnson Johnson with your time and all as your sponsor.

438
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And you know, I find the army is that before bummer's to chill it, you have sponsors for your show.

439
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Since the needle moves, you have no sponsors.

440
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I think you might want to reevaluate that nylon.

441
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I got plenty of sponsors.

442
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Both in D-gap and fun of the show and inside this program.

443
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
However, I will say that I have turned down quite a few because, or we've not come to terms because of the,

444
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
fuck use at the end of each comment.

445
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Interesting how that needle moves.

446
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
By the way, the needle doesn't need to move from me.

447
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Okay.

448
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's not about me.

449
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Please understand nylon.

450
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Back to Ron Paul.

451
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You two need each other.

452
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
He calls about 1% of the vote.

453
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And I gather this about 100 million iPods out there and you get about 1% of those downloads.

454
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So you two, to me, are the new 1%ers who need each other to try to get to 2%.

455
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And Adam, you're really starting to sound like a cheap, drive, time, talk, radio host.

456
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I like people better when you're signed sell to the podcast about nothing.

457
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
To me, you're losing relatives.

458
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Fits your brain.

459
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Anyway, good luck.

460
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And I'm hoping you and Dr. Ron have a good time.

461
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Bye.

462
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Oh, man.

463
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That would be quite a step back to go to 1%.

464
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But I understand where you're coming from with your sorted lack of knowledge nylon.

465
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Fantastic.

466
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
With Adam Curry.

467
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Hey, Adam.

468
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
For you ready to be stumps.

469
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And I'm going to use the hypnotastic test with young problem.

470
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Hey, Adam.

471
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
This is hit test number 93.

472
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And this is intro number one.

473
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Are you kidding me?

474
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm going to come run to you.

475
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Let's try an Adams.

476
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The Cougar from Vancouver.

477
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And number two.

478
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh, wow.

479
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's...

480
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Could that be my wife?

481
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Who's that lady with my man?

482
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Either that or it's...

483
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And this week's final one is number three.

484
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That's tough.

485
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Didn't anyone want to go want an in my handman?

486
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Algebraus.

487
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Uh...

488
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Moose garden?

489
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Moose garden.

490
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, moose garden.

491
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I think I've got at least two out of three, huh?

492
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And times up and these are the answers for you.

493
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes.

494
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Number one from 1985.

495
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Brian Adams.

496
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You and Dad.

497
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Dad.

498
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't want to see you.

499
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, I don't want to see you.

500
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Cause when they're feeling proud, I'm going away.

501
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I don't want to run to you.

502
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Run to you, Brian Adams is answer number one.

503
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Got that one.

504
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And this is answer number two from 1987.

505
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Oh, man, I'm lucky I got this one right.

506
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah.

507
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And Adam, don't tell me you've fucked this up again.

508
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I don't know.

509
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
This was your wife from 1977.

510
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Patricia, bye.

511
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
With a great song.

512
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Thanks, dude.

513
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Who is the lady with my man?

514
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But final one.

515
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Oh, my god.

516
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Number three.

517
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Algebraus.

518
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Is it?

519
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That's it.

520
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
From 1982.

521
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
This is Roof Garden.

522
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh, I'm gonna go on a walk.

523
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Same in the night band.

524
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Does anyone wanna go back?

525
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Something I'm not a bro.

526
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It's a loop.

527
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's a loop.

528
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah.

529
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You're a stepway fast.

530
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You took a step.

531
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Same on one.

532
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
One walk.

533
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Same in the dark.

534
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
What happened to Algebraus?

535
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm saying.

536
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
One walking dance.

537
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
On one.

538
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And some number three.

539
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Algebraus.

540
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And Roof Garden.

541
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That's from here.

542
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Number nine.

543
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
B3.

544
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah.

545
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
All right.

546
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The Adam.

547
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
How did you do?

548
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Three.

549
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You had them all.

550
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah.

551
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Leave in the second one.

552
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The one by your wife.

553
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah.

554
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I got it.

555
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
All right.

556
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The answer to this hit test.

557
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And also the links to iTunes.

558
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So you can buy these tricks.

559
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Can be found at hittest.potshow.com.

560
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Next week.

561
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'll be back for hit test.

562
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Number 94.

563
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So until then, take care.

564
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And just one final thing.

565
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
If it's still done.

566
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Adam.

567
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Fuck you.

568
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Bye.

569
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Respect test.

570
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The old pa ll

571
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Where?

572
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Teac expansion.

573
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't have sponsors.

574
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Adam Hey,

575
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Stage checks for musicians because in

576
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm listening to dsu

577
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
671.

578
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You just said.

579
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Yeah.

580
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,160
And I thought, are you ever going to like, when you're 60, are you going to like sit back

581
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
and write like the Adam Curry autobiography?

582
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:52,200
Because you got so many freaking stories that you just breeze over and I'm glad as you gave

583
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,400
the whole, you know, blow on a knife part of that, which was kind of cold, but I'm just

584
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
sure there's more to it.

585
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,800
I just ever wondered, have you ever thought about writing a book?

586
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,480
Just curious, a fit from your favorite scruncher, and of course, fuck you.

587
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,280
Yeah, you know how many times have been asked about that or to do that, I can't count

588
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,920
them on two hands anymore.

589
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,920
And of course, I'd love to write a book, but I think I need to wait another 20 years

590
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,840
at least, because when I go, I'm going to really go all out.

591
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,800
I'm going to tell everything, because I need to cleanse myself before I die.

592
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,200
So I'll have a couple more, you know, well, hopefully more than a couple of years and 20 years

593
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
from now.

594
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,400
By the way, Jack Sauer sent me an email, Adam was listening to DSC60, 675 on the

595
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
bus today.

596
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,640
That was two Fridays to go.

597
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,000
Hit test came on.

598
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,680
Every little thing she says is magic started playing when you said, you know the word

599
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
sing along.

600
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,400
I completely forgot I was on the bus and started singing out loud.

601
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,040
After about 30 seconds of singing, I realized everyone on the bus was staring at me.

602
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,120
Only you at him could make someone start singing out loud in public, keep up the

603
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
great work.

604
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,640
I would have to give some props to young pull-out there, because he does know how to

605
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,040
pick him, how but pick in my wife's song, trying to trick me up again, you bastard,

606
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
you bastard.

607
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,840
Adam is Jason Jarrett, call it this and this November the fifth thing you're talking

608
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,840
about wrong calls, can't say, you might not be aware, but remember remember the fifth

609
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
of November.

610
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm going to had a treason and plot.

611
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,440
And, lady, the terrorist link is to do with die force and why he didn't name them

612
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
on November the fifth.

613
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,840
Who knows, take care, Beth, he'll find out.

614
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,040
Yeah, I got a lot of feedback about that people saying, you know, that was probably what

615
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,800
the controversy was about donating money to the Ron Paul campaign on November 5th.

616
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,720
I think it's pretty genius actually, so they need to do some jingles for November, remember

617
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,800
remember the fifth of November gunpowder treason and plot, they'd need to come up with

618
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,440
a new rhyme or something like that.

619
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,360
Hey, Adam, this is Sean J, just have a weird thing happen, sitting at a stoplight, I had

620
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:56,440
both windows open and a butterfly flew through my car in one window and out the other, and

621
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
maybe think of your mom.

622
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,440
So, uh, just send out some love to you, um, keep up the great work, Dr. later.

623
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,760
Oh, man, that's a, that's a beautiful, thank you.

624
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,200
It happened to me the other day when Patricia and I were walking, uh, where were we?

625
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,800
We're on the island of White, and all of a sudden, and it's pretty late in the year

626
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,560
in a butterfly flew past.

627
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,200
Uh, yeah, you know how I believe in that kind of shipment.

628
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,760
I really appreciate you sending that in, makes me feel good.

629
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,360
So, Adam trees from San Diego, uh, been listening to you for quite some time, and now

630
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,640
I'm listening to you trying to open up my mind, make to make a left, and when I shouldn't

631
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:38,680
make a right, well, I took your advice, I made three less, and I was late, so you know

632
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
what that means?

633
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
Fuck you.

634
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
That's a, how do you fuck me?

635
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
Yeah.

636
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,880
No longer fuck you out of, fuck me.

637
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Hey.

638
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,360
I'm telling you, it does work, it's really good for your brain to do something out of the

639
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,360
routine.

640
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,360
Particularly those things you do with incredible routine, like picking up your tea cup,

641
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,360
pick up with a left hand instead of the right hand or right if you're left handed.

642
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,840
Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't make it, didn't want to make it late, did it work though, did

643
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
you feel that better?

644
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
Did you do it?

645
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
It's a lie.

646
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,200
You must have felt someone better.

647
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,200
First cause roll, now Gina Villalobos, somebody saved me.

648
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:38,680
Is next door, I think I'm gonna move on, I've been done with you, but I'm the CEO, you can't

649
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:45,960
