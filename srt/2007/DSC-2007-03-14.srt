Adam Curry's Daily source code is the program that started the new media revolution,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
where listeners and producers party together.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Adam is getting from the Zedeshon Keptown, South Africa.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Good morning, Adam.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Good morning, Adam.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Good morning, Adam.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Good morning, Adam.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Happy Thursday, Adam.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
How you doing?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Adam Curry.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How are you doing?

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm here.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Adam, it's all again from Kurt The Washington.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
With a cast of contributors from around the globe,

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and a passion at worldwide audience,

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
it's no wonder that the Daily Source Code was featured in Time magazine

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and made cover story news in Wired.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The Daily Source Code with Adam Curry.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's my arm.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Being able to choose the music that I want to play for you is

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
virtually Nirvana.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's low.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're supposed to be my trophy wife.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And I can just see it now.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's sweaty.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You really want to look that leg?

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's me the butt.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Good.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's geeky goodness.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I mean, just start this thing up on a command line

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and lock that puppy down.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You know, that's about all that's needed in it's all for you.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's my job to entertain you.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And if that means going to jail,

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
so be it.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Delta share a Charlie 5-6-2.

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
On the casting, it's out of curry.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Payman and Paris in 94.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I wasn't 95.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She was there studying abroad.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He was on tour.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Playing in another dive.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
They partied hard in the pocketweights.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
A little north of the sand.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He dreamed about her in so many ways.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She dreamed about her in French.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, she knows what to do with my call.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She knows how to make him feel.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And he's the one.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He's the mother son.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Not like anyone.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He just needs time to heal.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They met in New York a few months later.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He was still living alone.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hugging the ball and masturbating.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Never answered his phone.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The first date was a movie together.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Outside it Brian Pock.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We're the spirit of St. Louis.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Just went on forever until they drank wine.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Until they saw us cause.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Well, she knows what to do with my call.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
She knows how to make him feel.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That he's the one.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He's the mother son.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Not like anyone.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He just needs time to heal.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They finally hooked up for the first time.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The night before the Fourth of July.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He felt so awkward saying goodbye to the girl who just changed his life.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Now my friend, they are inseparable.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
She even gets that boy to go to the gym.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Now if you don't think that's love, you must be cynical.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh, maybe man, you're just dreaming in French.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, because she knows what to do with my call.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
She knows how to make him feel.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That he's the one.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He's the mother son.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He just needs time to heal.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, she knows what to do with my call.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
She knows how to make him feel.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That he's the one.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He's the mother son.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Not like anyone.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He just needs time to heal.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, he's the one.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He's the mother son.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Not like anyone.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He just needs time to heal.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He just needs time to heal.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What to do with Michael?

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's daily source code episode five, six, two coming to you.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Almost live from New York.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Everybody, you're doing it.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What are we now?

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Wednesday, the 14th.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Technically, of course, it's Wednesday, although from me it's Tuesday nights.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Still on that night.

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We schedule even though I'm on the on the East Coast.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But it's only actually the only time I can do the show.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's been another crazy day in New York.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But I love this city, the energy.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And you know, it's so easy to get around from from office to office.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And from meeting to meeting, you know, it's just it's, it's a town made for business.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I got to tell you.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I love it.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And what a fantastic day.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It started way too early.

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Of course.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I was embedded.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
See after the show last night.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't know.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I started to want or something like that in the alarm when it's 630.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's just not enough sleep for a growing boy.

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But of course, I, when I'm in the hotel here, I do really literally go to sleep.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
When I get in bed because the porn is horrible.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's really no good.

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And they have, yeah.

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's just like the standard service porn service and all the hotels in New York.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Isn't it good?

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Just no good porn.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Anyway, not the you care.

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So breakfast at like 715, you know, off to the first meetings it ate.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, yes, pounding the pavement.

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let me see, um, or some of the fun things that happened today.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yes.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I had a, had a meeting over at Marie Claire at the, at the Hearst,

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hearst Publishing Building.

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Marie Claire, of course, we produce the mast head,

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
which is behind the scenes at Mary.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Do we, I don't know if it's Marie Claire or Mary Claire.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, Joanna, who's the editor and chief and also star of the, star of the show.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It says Marie Claire.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So I met her.

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I met the publisher.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Uh, our main contact who is, you know, basically our,

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
our counterpart.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, well, can you tell I'm tired.

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Our counterpoint for production.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Uh, let me tell you.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sorry.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Up in those offices.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Man, it's like,

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, estrogen spill on 105.

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Man, oh, man.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's some powerful women.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And they know what they want.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, boy.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That was a lot of fun.

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Actually, I, and it was really great meeting Joanna, man.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
She's a, she's just as dynamic in person.

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
She, yeah, she's on the show.

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And I understand why she's kicking ass on that magazine.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But here is something incredibly cool.

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So I was, we're planning out the next couple of episodes.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Um, there's an interview planned both for the magazine,

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
but also for the show with Angelina Jolie.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah.

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes, who's going to be doing special executive producing on the set that day, huh?

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes.

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I, it's either April 4th or May 4th.

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't care which one.

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm, I'm, I'm caching in my virgin Atlantic miles.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And, uh, I'll be there.

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So that was, uh, without a doubt, highlight of the day.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And, uh, I was actually, um,

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll check in my email on the, uh, on the good old Nokia tablet.

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Um, in the back of the cab on the way to an appointment.

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And I saw an email come in from Eric Bergen's mom.

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Now, you remember Eric is, uh,

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
uh, the a podcaster, or I know him as a podcaster from Green Room Radio.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Come, sorry.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm just so tired.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Um, and he invited me to come see the Jersey Boys as the production was in San Francisco.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And it turns out he's one of the leading as one of the leading roles.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And it was really good.

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And I enjoyed it immensely.

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And, uh, his mom has a podcaster.

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And, uh, I think at one point probably in the back and forth conversation,

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I asked if his mom was hot.

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I got a, uh, I got a voicemail comment from Eric's mom today.

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And I was listening to this on my, on my tablet.

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And I was cracking up.

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's fantastic.

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Check it out.

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Mr. Adam Curry.

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I thought I needed to leave you a little voicemail.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This is Alison Lee, the host of CraftCast www.craftcast.com.

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Also better known as Eric Bergen's mother.

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I guess that makes me a Jersey mother.

198
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah.

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Something along those lines.

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah, baby.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Anyway, I listened to my son's call in comment.

202
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And as much as I appreciate, obviously, my son giving me a big play on air.

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He sort of played up that whole domesticated thing in a way that made me feel.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hmm.

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Now, what do you think so far?

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Does she sound hot or what?

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Eric, I called you here, Eric.

208
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
This is not for you, okay?

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Pretty cool voice, huh?

210
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Not so hot, actually.

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm not that a son should really think of their mother as hot.

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Frankly, I had to call in and set the record straight.

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So, you know, even when you do crafts and are domesticated,

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
you can be sort of hot.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think you should check us out.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And guess what, Adam?

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What, baby?

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're really hot.

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Bye.

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Thanks for your show.

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, man.

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What kind of hum did you have?

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You had a hum or Eric's mom?

224
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You've got to fix your mic.

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Get Eric to fix your mic.

226
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You sound hot.

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Definitely.

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hmm.

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, I don't know what to say.

230
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm kind of flabbergasted.

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But, you know, I knew that your mom was hot.

232
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, you know, as a wise man once said,

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
you only really have to look at the branch to know what the beauty of the tree will be.

234
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Adam, check this out.

235
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
More evidence that DSC listeners love to spank it.

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And no, no, no, calm down, calm down.

237
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Don't want to get you all excited.

238
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Like that time, the John Norris showed up to work.

239
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We're in that t-shirt that said mustache rides 25 cents.

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No, what I mean is that there are DSC listeners out there who can play

241
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
some mean mother fucking guitar right on.

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This one comes to us courtesy of John Walker,

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
who sent in the solo section from a song from his band,

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Logan Var.

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I believe it's pronounced.

246
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Logan Var could be lock and var.

247
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Isn't that what the deft leopard say on Rock of Ages?

248
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Definitely.

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You go and flip.

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Logan Var.

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The way it sounds like some kind of medical instrument they use during surgery.

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What I like is he says in his email.

253
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It was recorded in his home studio in one take between conference calls.

254
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Take that corporate America.

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And if you listen to a close, you can hear how he uses the wall up pedal.

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And like that kind of like halfway down position and get like a really cool,

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
like semi-wall tone in there.

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah, you know, all about to halfway down and semi-mark.

259
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Really kind of nice.

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So Adam get ready.

261
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Rock out with your cock out.

262
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Spring notes all over the place with his band lock and var.

263
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is John Walker.

264
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll tell you, take some of that blue scale stuff and crank it up.

265
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It always sounds good to me.

266
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Hey, John says the gear used in this solo is a THD Univalve.

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And I've been as tube screamer a cry baby.

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And his blaze strat.

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I know to those of you out there don't care anything about musical gear.

270
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I might as well just to say.

271
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So thank you, John Walker.

272
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And you can find lock and var at the pot safe music network at music.potcho.com.

273
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Or you can find their CD fire eyes at CDbaby.com.

274
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Hey, if any other DSC listeners out there have a guitar solo that they want to share.

275
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't care if it's rock or it's blues or it's jazz or blue grass or, you know,

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
you just picking away on an acoustic guitar send it to me at house of tone house of tone.

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
All one word at gmail.com.

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Adam, thank you again for playing this.

279
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
My brother and just want to let you know that every day we keep the guitar solo alive

280
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
is another day that we strike tyranny in the hearts of boy bands everywhere.

281
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't know idea what I'm saying.

282
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But anyway, thanks again.

283
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And I'll catch you next week with another guitar solo on house of tone.

284
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Later, keep in the axe.

285
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Wank alive.

286
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Mark Hiroshima to name cough.

287
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
All right.

288
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Mark, thank you.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Hey, gmail update.

290
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You know, I was popping my mail.

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So literally using the pop 3 protocol to get mail from one gmail account to the other.

292
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Which, of course, is kind of ridiculous because, you know, with like a couple of keystrokes.

293
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
All that mail should be able to point it to to be pointed to a different account.

294
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
When did I start this?

295
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
When did I leave Friday?

296
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Because it does like 200 mails at a time.

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And it only will do this a couple times an hour.

298
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So far, I've gotten about 8%.

299
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And it's just an ongoing process.

300
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It just keeps popping this mail over.

301
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
8% of my old Gmail account is now in my new Google apps 10 gigabyte account.

302
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Now, here's what really slays me.

303
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So in the middle of all this yesterday, I noticed that my standard Gmail account, all of a sudden, went to 10 gigs.

304
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Can you believe that?

305
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So I don't know if that's a part of having gotten Google apps.

306
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I mean, I don't recall ever saying, you know, add this old account to it or something.

307
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I have no idea what happened.

308
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But now I have 10 gigs on the old account.

309
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
10 gigs on the new account.

310
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And I guess basically I'm just going to leave the pop process going.

311
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Because now it's just fun to watch how long it takes to move.

312
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
How long it takes Google to make you move four gigs of data.

313
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You know, it's we're moving on four to five days now.

314
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's nuts.

315
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Hey, Adam writes Bart Floohles.

316
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's just from the Oklahoma Department of Transportation.

317
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The Oakland Department of Transportation.

318
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Interesting.

319
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Adam, I'm shopping around for a Mike preamp and heard on the Daily Source Code.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You're using a personas for your New York setup.

321
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Can you tell me what kind?

322
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Sounded really sweet.

323
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, this is that new box that I got.

324
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Let me see.

325
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The hotel phone is on top of it.

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Let me just.

327
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The hotel phone has a core that is just too short to move it anywhere except where they put it on the desk, which is dumb.

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah.

329
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I don't know if they make these anymore.

330
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I actually picked it up second hand at Anderton's music in Guilford.

331
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's the, and it is pre-son as PRA pop aroma echoes Sierra Oscar November, uniform Sierra.

332
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's called the smart.

333
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's the blue max smart compressor.

334
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And it says a little stereo compressor.

335
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It doesn't even, there's no limiter in it.

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So you can overmodulate it.

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But very simple.

338
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's got some presets on there.

339
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm, right now, I'm using preset stereo one preset.

340
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You can set it manually, but I kind of like the way this sounded.

341
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And you have got your input, your ratio, and your attack, and your release.

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And it's beautiful.

343
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And the nice thing about it doesn't have an external power supply.

344
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You plug, you know, a cord, an AC cord right into the back of it.

345
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Because the power supply is what kills me, man.

346
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I have a bag that is literally just for power supplies.

347
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You know what, I haven't suggested anything.

348
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I haven't endorsed anything.

349
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:44,000
All I did was I said, look, when I saw an inconvenience,

350
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I talked about that.

351
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And now I saw this movie.

352
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There was a channel for movie.

353
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And it's called The Great Global Warming Swing.

354
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't let it refutes everything that we, that is common,

355
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I guess common knowledge about global warming,

356
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and the cause of it being CO2 emissions.

357
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And how are all going to die?

358
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Die, I tell you.

359
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We're going to die.

360
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I guarantee you, 100% you're going to die.

361
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's just maybe not during the global warming.

362
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And I haven't gotten a lot of hate mail, actually.

363
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You know, I've gotten mail people saying you don't know what to tell you talking about,

364
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
but I'm not talking, I don't know what I'm talking about.

365
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm just a messenger.

366
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
A messenger that's used to getting shot, by the way.

367
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
When you have these sort of polarizing arguments,

368
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
one of the things I like to look at is sort of the solitary,

369
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
with which people will, you know, kind of defend their stance

370
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
without really addressing the counter bailing evidence,

371
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
for instance, with this global warming swindle documentary.

372
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It seems, on my end, it seems like a very compelling data

373
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
that, you know, hey, maybe this big hot,

374
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
sphere called the Sun, which is many thousand times

375
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
the size of the Earth might actually, you know,

376
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
have a little bit to do with how hot our planet is,

377
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
rather than, you know, carbon dioxide emissions from man.

378
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So, you know, I think rather than jumping on either side of the data,

379
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I think what we need to do is look at the data,

380
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and, you know, I have to be in truth,

381
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and I have watched this great global warming swindle,

382
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
you know, I would say that the BBC show,

383
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
so, you know, very compelling evidence,

384
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and I think that people want to say that global warming does exist

385
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
that they do need to discount some of this evidence,

386
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
such that, you know, solar activity may have something

387
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
to do with the temperature here on Earth.

388
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So, do I want to go on too long?

389
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes.

390
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
All right, perfect time to stop.

391
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Folder scruncher? No, none of that.

392
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah, exactly.

393
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's, and it wasn't a BBC documentary,

394
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
it was Channel 4, and in show notes from,

395
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
or was it yesterday, the day or Friday, from football Friday,

396
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
you can, or just uncurry.com, I think,

397
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
is where I put it.

398
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You can find a link to see to watch this on a YouTube,

399
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
or Google video.

400
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's actually, I wonder.

401
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Is it still on Google video?

402
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Now that Viacom has, I love that story.

403
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Viacom suing YouTube slash Google for $1 billion.

404
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah, that is a negotiating tactic.

405
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Okay, that's, that's the way the big boys do business,

406
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and believe me, Google is not going to pay

407
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm going to pay out of billion dollars.

408
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
They're going to work something out.

409
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But, of course, the real losers in all of this are us.

410
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You know, we now figure it out already, guys.

411
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Will you please?

412
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But, wow, you know, that when, when Google and public

413
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
and in their perspectives, Larry and Sarah, Sarah Gay,

414
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Sarah Gay, Sarah Gay, Sarah Gay, Sarah Gay.

415
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I said that they would do no evil.

416
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It wasn't dope be evil, by the way.

417
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It was do no evil.

418
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Big difference.

419
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I see it even the New York Times is quoting that one.

420
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's just going to come flying back in their face.

421
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Now, you, you can almost predict it's going to happen.

422
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But, fun story to follow.

423
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's for sure.

424
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Fun to see, as actually, I haven't, I've looked,

425
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I've watched a little bit of news that watched

426
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
American Idol tonight, which I thought was an all-time low.

427
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What a horrible show.

428
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And, you know, I don't know if you saw this one with, with

429
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

430
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:21,280
little bit of a bit of confusion about a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of. Okay. Oh yeah. Nice. You got to do this. got to do this now. You didn't have to do it up yet too. So first thing about the huge open space. So one thing I do to suggest you have to be kind of enjoyable moments. Yeah. That is atenium wondering if you didn't have to do it up in a little bit outside or something or a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of some food that I always forget is did didる at your end. hurts for later hardly everything.

431
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:37,440
1, 3, 7, 5, 3, plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.

432
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Sorry about that.

433
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,600
Man, it's good to have been talking all day.

434
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,600
I haven't saved any for you, honey, I'm so sorry.

435
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,440
Hey Adam, it's the New Yorker in London, the nylon and momentan.

436
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,760
I just wanted to get a look for your heads up.

437
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,440
Current TV, UK, something that new to USV was,

438
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,360
but it's starting here today, Monday on Channel 229 on Sky TV.

439
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,080
And it's kind of you to meet mainstream media

440
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,680
with user-generated content on the television set.

441
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,200
Now you can go to their website and figure out

442
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,640
how you do it, because you put it on the site,

443
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,440
people vote on it, and they put it on the TV.

444
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,040
But it's very interesting, because convergence is not just technology,

445
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,320
but media.

446
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,160
And it'll be curious to see just how this takes off

447
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,160
and the impact on podcasting, for example.

448
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,240
And video casting, as well as the YouTube generation,

449
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,760
as it hits mainstream.

450
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,720
So just to learn to do that, if you haven't been aware,

451
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,960
and your listeners, if they haven't been aware,

452
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,080
and it'll be interesting trend,

453
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,520
that's current TV on Sky 2-2-9.

454
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,960
Yep, bye.

455
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,000
All right, nylon, thank you.

456
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,920
It's a guy from New York and London, nylon.

457
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,960
We're just gonna call you nylon from nylon, okay?

458
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,400
Nylon.

459
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,800
Yeah, I've seen previews of this.

460
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,320
I was not very impressed.

461
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,240
You know, it feels forced to me,

462
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,960
and this whole voting thing,

463
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,800
why does everything that is generated by independence

464
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,000
have to be denigrated to contests

465
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,400
of American idol like format.

466
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,960
You know, it's boring.

467
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,280
I had a conversation with,

468
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,760
I'm not gonna tell you who that was,

469
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,200
but with a media buyer.

470
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,000
And that's what I'll tell you,

471
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,920
was for the, for Doritos.

472
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,600
And it's a big ass brand, Doritos is huge,

473
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,240
and I would love to have them on the network.

474
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,200
But you know, the first idea,

475
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,640
now maybe we could do a contest,

476
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,520
and I'm so sick and tired of contest.

477
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Let's not do a contest.

478
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,440
Why don't you just sponsor some damn good media?

479
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,800
That's exactly the way I've been talking

480
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,960
this week in New York.

481
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,760
It's been a very liberating

482
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,360
and I've gotten good responses.

483
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,320
So yeah, everything seems to have to be a contest

484
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,840
when it's not mainstream.

485
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,560
It's like such a separation.

486
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,360
And we've done it too,

487
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,720
but I'm a little tired of it at this point.

488
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,200
Just everything is like,

489
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,800
create the commercial, you know,

490
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,120
where were you?

491
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,920
In the 2005, man, we've been there done that.

492
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,440
Oh, before I forget, let me thank my sponsors for this show

493
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,080
that being folders.

494
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,960
I have been drinking a lot of folders coffee

495
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,080
because I don't like waiting for room service.

496
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,880
So I've got, well, it's not the gourmet stuff.

497
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
It's instant.

498
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,400
So I have that here in my hotel room.

499
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,240
And of course, whenever I see it on the table,

500
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,040
I always reach for the splendor,

501
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,600
because, you know, those two,

502
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,520
it just makes for a perfect combination

503
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,320
and a perfect taste.

504
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,160
Yes.

505
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,600
A serious satellite star is one or two listeners.

506
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,080
That's it for you for today.

507
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,240
Those of you still hang around.

508
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,080
Thank you.

509
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,920
Listen to this.

510
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,760
It's not often we get a comment from France.

511
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,480
France, of course, is a very interesting country

512
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,880
when it comes to media.

513
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,880
And their nationalistic view and a way protectionistic view

514
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,520
or stance on media, you know,

515
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,280
there are rules about how much foreign versus national content

516
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,040
is portrayed, displayed, and played on any form of mainstream media.

517
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,440
And the French, right?

518
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,600
OK, so listen to this.

519
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,560
Hello, hello.

520
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:23,760
Hello.

521
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,440
Good afternoon, from France.

522
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,680
I'm listening to the G.S.C.

523
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,080
5, 6, oh, it's talking out there in the morning.

524
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,720
You see, on Clarison, about the global war,

525
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:47,840
I think you might try to get your hands on a book.

526
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,360
I think it came out two years ago.

527
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,760
It's called State of Fear.

528
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,200
It's a book written by Michael Christon,

529
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,000
not guy who wrote Jurassic Park on goal.

530
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
All those great books.

531
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,240
It's something like science.

532
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,680
It's a fiction, science fiction.

533
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,200
It's quite interesting.

534
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,680
Try to read that book.

535
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,960
Hey, it got an R.U.A. scrunched or a full day.

536
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,120
So I'm listening to that.

537
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,360
And by the way, I appreciate it, Edgar,

538
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,760
because I have seen state of fear.

539
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,360
People have told me about it.

540
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,040
And I would, of course, that's going to be fiction.

541
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,960
And I'm really a little bit into the nonfiction these days.

542
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
But anytime you've got a book,

543
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
you want to recommend to me.

544
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,080
I really appreciate that.

545
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,040
And of course, I do the same when I read a good book for you guys.

546
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,240
But listening to Edgar's voice, I'm like,

547
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,560
I know this guy.

548
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,960
I know him from somewhere.

549
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,920
So I hunted around on my first gen iPod.

550
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,160
And I found it.

551
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,760
It's him.

552
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,040
It's Edgar.

553
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Check it out.

554
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,280
I don't like Edgar.

555
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,200
Edgar, come on in my friend.

556
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,280
My friend from France.

557
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,320
I got a caption for you quantities.

558
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,960
No what?

559
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,240
That makes you uncomfortable.

560
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,560
Fuck you.

561
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,480
I'm the re-endrover, you're driving on.

562
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Yeah.

563
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
Oh, my man.

564
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,200
Fuck your sub convertible.

565
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,960
And the fuck get twice weekly trips to the analyst.

566
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,160
Still with a lot of fuck.

567
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,240
Fuck the harm done.

568
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Me, no.

569
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,160
I'm blind festin' south of France.

570
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,160
I'm here to ask for God, more cash done, God, I can't come.

571
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
So I don't do just a thing.

572
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,160
That's just right.

573
00:27:51,160 --> 00:28:01,160
I'm sure the death on your damn design of David from my doucheys.

574
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,160
No cholesterol, naturally.

575
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,160
You're a big old son that knew we are times.

576
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Fuck no odds, keep turning up.

577
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
And newsweek.

578
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:29,160
And a lot, including nation, village voice, radiate, and the rest.

579
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,160
To be set up, religion, motherfuckers.

580
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Take this passion over to have one of Tarleton movies.

581
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,160
One of Tarleton movies.

582
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
And fuck, if you can.

583
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:58,160
You're a pencil thin, deviant drinking, calorie counting, caffeine limiting.

584
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:06,160
So the I'm sparing, new dress sweet, sweetening, rear view mirror of a preening.

585
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Cara, nibbling, body.

586
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:16,160
So the drone in a leg comes like, cool, fucker.

587
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,160
I got cash.

588
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,160
What else matters?

589
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
I got cash.

590
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Slavery.

591
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Fuck your fencing school, yes, fuck yo.

592
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,160
It's on your fullo, onion, a variety.

593
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:51,160
Oh fuck, all that shit to call me, the content to enjoy.

594
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Got cash.

595
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,160
And I got cash.

596
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
I'm gonna have you with that.

597
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,160
Oh, go sit down, yes, cure.

598
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,160
On the Tarleton, of course.

599
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,160
We let your political correct, as you.

600
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,160
But I think you're at big also.

601
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,160
And you don't ask for it.

602
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,160
And you're idea of multiculturalism.

603
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
Japanese restaurant on Monday.

604
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,160
In the untaused day.

605
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,160
And I'm Wednesday, Caribbean.

606
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Not too spicy, please.

607
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Well, I got cash.

608
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
I got cash.

609
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,160
One is in the family for generations.

610
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
I'm afraid to break.

611
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
I'm trying to find the need to buy.

612
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
Telling you, it's the unpleasant.

613
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
You're not forgot.

614
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,160
I got cash, motherfucker.

615
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
And you can't tell whether or not I'm joking.

616
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
Can you?

617
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Don't fuck.

618
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
What's playing on?

619
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
At least first.

620
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Oh, man, I got cash.

621
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Fuck you.

622
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Quantities.

623
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
It's got to be Edgar from France.

624
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Thank you for calling in my friend.

625
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,160
And of course, that's another track of Adam's first gen.

626
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
I bought.

627
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,160
It's been on there for something like five years.

628
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Tom's hooting.

629
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
Send me actually a copy.

630
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
Two weeks ago.

631
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
And it was just so coincidental.

632
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
But there you go.

633
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Completely our friend from France.

634
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
Edgar, feel free to call on any time, buddy.

635
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
I'll play it on.

636
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Adam's first gen.

637
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
I bought.

638
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Hello, Adam.

639
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,160
It's Mike Turner here from Bristol.

640
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
In the UK.

641
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,160
Just third year or two by Friday's podcast.

642
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,160
You're talking about a portable rig for cashblaster.

643
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
I've just been listening to audio courses.

644
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
57 podcasts.

645
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
It's came out this weekend.

646
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
These uses cashblasters.

647
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,160
I'll let's Chris Hamley and he's from the UK as well.

648
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
The audio courses.com.

649
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Please talk about the ST software plugins for cashblaster.

650
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I don't think cashblaster has got any facility here.

651
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
The moment I saw that plugin.

652
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
So I'm presumably the cashblaster.

653
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Mike, listen to the daily source code as well.

654
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
I guess he does.

655
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,160
My deal solution for a mobile rig for a portable cashblaster.

656
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Especially if you're off to a New York safe car and two lamps.

657
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,160
You know he's gay and whatever you can't run.

658
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,160
And we've given the facilities of modern processes.

659
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
There's only this sort of stuff coming handled in real time.

660
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
In software it is handled in stuff like.

661
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Potholes and other record and few base and other recording devices.

662
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Which actually does handling real time.

663
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
There's only this would be an option for cashblaster.

664
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
That's all that I'm just about to do this.

665
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Cheers.

666
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,160
I really like that comment.

667
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Of course that was about cashblaster.

668
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
It's the software that I use to create the daily source code.

669
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
You can find it at cashblaster.com.

670
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,160
And this is the VST plugin architecture.

671
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,160
It's very interesting indeed because there are some great plugins.

672
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,160
And you could literally before the Mike channel and for the music and effects channel.

673
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,160
You could put on reverb or compression or whatever you want.

674
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,160
And it would be a perfect thing for for cashblaster pro.

675
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,160
But I hope Mike still listens.

676
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
I think he does.

677
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,160
I think the problem though is that you're going to build in a delay.

678
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
Because it's still you know it's a digital process.

679
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,160
The audio is being processed.

680
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,160
And for me the way I work I want to be able to hear the ends.

681
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,160
You know it's like I think the computer fan is on or something.

682
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
It's making a horrible hum.

683
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
I got a hum.

684
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,160
See is that any better?

685
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Not much.

686
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Whenever you introduce something into the chain essentially that is software.

687
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Not hardware based and VST plugins are software based.

688
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
It's going to give you a delay.

689
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,160
And then it's you start to talk funny because you hear yourself.

690
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:58,160
Like a couple milliseconds later than the words are coming out of your mouth.

691
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,160
So I don't think it's technically possible.

692
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,160
At least not in the way that the cashblaster was designed to be used.

693
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
Hey Adam this is Blake Morgan in New York City.

694
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,160
I just want to drop you a quick thank you for the tremendous support you've given me.

695
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,160
And the other artists on my label engine company records.

696
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Every time you've played any of our material whether it's my stuff or Leslie Gores or Mike Aracos.

697
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:27,160
We've immediately seen a major bump in our sales on iTunes off of our artists websites and off of the record company website.

698
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,160
It's not an accident when it happens.

699
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,160
It's completely clear that it's a direct result of daily source code spinning our music.

700
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
So I'm here to tell you that podcasts, pod safe music network.

701
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,160
It's making a direct impact on the success of our music and independent music in general.

702
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,160
I came from a major record label that I ditched to start my own national record company.

703
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,160
So believe me when I tell you I know what I'm talking about.

704
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
So please keep doing what you're doing.

705
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,160
Spread the word about great new music. We truly appreciate what you're trying to do.

706
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,160
And I think that not only are you refusing to appeal to the lowest common denominator.

707
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
You've become a major factor in raising it.

708
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,160
So keep the music coming. I'm a big fan and I hope to talk to you soon.

709
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Take care Adam. Thank you Blake. I really appreciate that.

710
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,160
In the old days and if you've seen pictures of Adam's attic at the curry manner.

711
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,160
You would get like a gold record. You know, that was kind of the thing.

712
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,160
That was the way the record companies and the artists would say thanks for helping out.

713
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,160
Of course, because you're not really on the real, on the real goods, you know, with the real money's flowing.

714
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,160
As a VJ or DJ, you don't see any in that.

715
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,160
So you get a gold record, which of course it's nice. You know, it's cool. It really is.

716
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,160
Although I must say somewhere in the mid 90s, the gold records were the qualities complete crap.

717
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,160
You know, I've taken these records out and they don't play.

718
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,160
You know, the old ones that Patricia has are really gold plated and if you play him, you can actually hear that the song is on him.

719
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:02,160
I'm not allowed to demonstrate that anymore because the last time I did that, we couldn't get the frame back together perfectly.

720
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,160
And so it's kind of like that gold record of hers is always kind of crooked and she's really pissed off about it.

721
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,160
But it's cool because it literally is, what's not really, you know, a goal. It's um, it's guess it's to think the call it the mother master is that what it is.

722
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,160
So you actually have to play it backwards on a turntable in order to hear the song.

723
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
But it really was the song.

724
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:41,160
And then after a while that it just became kind of a joke and you know, they put the stick cassettes in there before CDs and the cassette, you know, they're like the little gold spray painted cassette would, you know, the glue would come undone and then, you know, that would kind of like one end would like tilt down and, you know, or completely fall to the bottom of the frame.

725
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:50,160
But for you to say that, that means a lot to me and it means a lot to me that it's working because it's kind of we, we set out to do, you know.

726
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,160
A Blake's also a musician, by the way.

727
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,160
The perfect splendor sponsorship, saccharine.

728
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Whatever, I'm not supposed to be so clever, I'm not supposed to be together.

729
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:47,160
And the anger in my second skill feels real.

730
00:38:49,160 --> 00:39:02,160
And the cancer in my second skill feels real.

731
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,160
It feels real.

732
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,160
It feels real.

733
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,160
It feels real.

734
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:36,160
For give me fever, I'm not sick enough.

735
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:47,160
For give me weather, I'm not well enough.

736
00:39:48,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Whatever, I'm not supposed to be so clever, I'm not supposed to be together.

737
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:13,160
And the anger in my second skill feels real.

738
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:28,160
And the cancer in my second skill feels real.

739
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,160
It feels real.

740
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,160
It feels real.

741
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:45,160
It feels real.

742
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:30,160
Whatever, I'm not supposed to be so clever, I'm not supposed to be together.

743
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:40,160
And the anger in my second skill feels real.

744
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:50,160
And the cancer in my second skill feels real.

745
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:59,160
It feels real.

746
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:10,160
It feels real.

747
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:20,160
And the anger in my second skill feels real.

748
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Awesome.

749
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Great pipes, Blake, awesome dude, I really like that.

750
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:35,160
Let me see if I have that right, hold on.

751
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:44,160
The Brian Leslie Gore, who is performing in Chicago at the American Airlines concert hall in Illinois Chicago 7 p.m.

752
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:54,160
On the 17th, just so you know, let's see, I'm really bummed because PD loves sent me an opener for the show.

753
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:01,160
And he sent the email and he sent the link to Jersey Jung, he said, you know, play some Jersey Jung on the show, man.

754
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,160
But then he forgot to attach the opener, which is a real bummer because I hate it when he puts a work into stuff and I can't use it.

755
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,160
So I'm like just sitting here clicking refresh on my Gmail and see if it comes in.

756
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Okay, I'm sorry. Oh, look at this.

757
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
This is interesting.

758
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,160
Time sensitive PSA for families united against hate.

759
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,160
Play this on your podcast playing this on your podcast will be very helpful.

760
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Oh, it's from Rebecca from Trini Recradio.

761
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,160
I think, yeah, Trini Recradio, right?

762
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,160
Trini Rec.com, shall we listen?

763
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,160
I've had bad experiences while on the road and just playing stuff without pre-listening.

764
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,160
Let's live dangerously shall we? Let me see what this is, hold on.

765
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,160
Sounds like shit.

766
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,160
Hi folks. My name is Ethan St. Pierre and I am working with an LGBT organization called Family United Against Hate.

767
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,160
You can go to their website at www.fuah.org.

768
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,160
That's fuah.org.

769
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:14,160
Family United Against Hate offers support guidance and assistance to families and individuals dealing with incidents based on bias

770
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,160
and to the people organizations and agencies who serve and support them.

771
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:28,160
We are getting a group of LGBT hate crimes survivors to stand side by side and lobby Congress and support of an explicitly inclusive hate crimes bill

772
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,160
and to send the message that anything less is unacceptable.

773
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
We do not want to leave anyone out of this event.

774
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,160
If you, as someone you know, has either suffered a loss or experienced anti LGBT violence

775
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:49,160
and would like to be a part of this lobby event, please contact me at radical guy at gmail.com.

776
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,160
Families united against hate and the trans FM internet broadcasting network will be sponsoring a fundraising event

777
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:04,160
to help to fray the cost of the travel and or hotel expense to those who cannot afford to make the trip on their own.

778
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,160
Fundraising event will begin at 10 p.m. on Friday night.

779
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,160
Oh man, look, this is not the way to do this public service announcement. It's just only not even halfway through yet.

780
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:23,160
No, no, no, no, no. You got to get people to go to web page that will, you know, with all the details who gives us shit about what time.

781
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,160
That sounds like like you're like you're on to something though.

782
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:37,160
The hate crime in general, it doesn't even have to be against gay lesbian by transgender, whatever GLBT stands for.

783
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,160
That doesn't have to be. It can be any hate crime in general.

784
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,160
Do we not have a log in hate crime? Come on. Is that, do we not?

785
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,160
Do we not have a log in hate crime? That's that doesn't sound right to me.

786
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:56,160
All right. Okay. It's time for me to go to bed. I've had it.

787
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,160
No, open it from PD love. Unfortunately.

788
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,160
Daily source code dot com, add them to podshow dot com if you want to email me something.

789
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,160
And of course, although I don't really want to say it, you can obviously attach something these days.

790
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,160
Because, you know, I've got that wonderful 10 gig limit now, my Gmail.

791
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:24,160
And if I could just find, where is it? A crap. Oh, man. Oh, here it is.

792
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,160
Very important before I say goodbye. Talk to you tomorrow. Take care.

793
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:38,160
Another podshow podcast. Stick it in your ear.
