Headbanging.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Move, raise it.

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,840
Seeker's cracking.

8
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,000
Slow dance and hip, raise it.

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,040
Beat, slamming.

10
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,480
Trouble, tweaked.

11
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,520
Dooms.

12
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,880
That's 25.

13
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,680
Breathe.

14
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,720
And be free.

15
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,000

Hotshow.com.

17
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,840
Don and Drew's show.

18
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,320
No, that was really bad.

19
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,680
And do that again.

20
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,160
Even for all of this, any other fucking.

21
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,160
Don and Drew's show is 646.

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,600
Get ready baby.

23
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,560
Yeah.

24
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:38,960
Yeah.

25
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,920
The Don and Drew's show.

26
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,480
Hey, everyone.

27
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,280
It's Don, Miss Ellie.

28
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,480
And Drew, Don and Chris.

29
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,400
And Adam Klee.

30
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,000
For the first time ever, somehow we have Adam Kuri on the show.

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Somehow, well, you happen to be in my room.

32
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

33
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,160
Jowing the fruits of my friendships.

34
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,520
That sounds so hot.

35
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,040
You know, it is.

36
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,320
We were on the three year waiting list.

37
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,480
Yeah.

38
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,960
Yeah, people don't know that with Patrick,

39
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,440
you have to wait three years for me with Adam.

40
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,160
We haven't done a show together ever.

41
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,120
Have we done a Skype thing, never?

42
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,480
No.

43
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,320
Double-endor?

44
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,840
Never?

45
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,960
Well, we did the double-endor.

46
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,600
Yeah.

47
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Not audio.

48
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Yeah, all right.

49
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,640
That was just our private time.

50
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,840
So, well, thanks for letting me on you show.

51
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,360
Thanks for being with him.

52
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
Yeah.

53
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,720
Um, so we're at the portable media

54
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,260
the expo in the lovely butthole city of Ontario, California.

55
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,460
This is really the pits. It really is, you know what I'm talking about here.

56
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,100
Well, it's just like everything is completely wrong.

57
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,620
It's like take this room for instance, you know, it's like you get a sweet, but there's no

58
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,620
mini bar.

59
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,620
Right.

60
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,620
It gets a water.

61
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,320
It's the little things, the little things that irritate.

62
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,040
Got a huge flat screen TV, and then, you know, but like no electrical outlet, let's

63
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
have that anywhere.

64
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,040
It's like I can't plug anything in.

65
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
It's wrong.

66
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
It's just wrong.

67
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,040
But you are going to be able to plug in your USB lava lamp.

68
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Well, yeah, but it plugs into the computer.

69
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
I know.

70
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Let's skip G. That's the one thing I like about being here.

71
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,040
If you do, you meet some of the listeners. You guys do this all the time.

72
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,040
So, yeah, you meet all your minions.

73
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
Because we're of the people.

74
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
You are of the people.

75
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
Yeah.

76
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Of course, I'm above the law.

77
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
Yeah, right.

78
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
So skip G. He's written in.

79
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
I think he's called an a comment.

80
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Um, but that was it's really touching when someone gives you a gift that they really

81
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
thought about.

82
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
That's why I was asked for books.

83
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
It says, what do you want to give me a book?

84
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Because you know, whatever you give me tells me more about you and what you think of me.

85
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,040
I'm going to send you such dirty books.

86
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,040
In Europe, we'd call you a dirty woman.

87
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,040
They call me that worldwide.

88
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,040
It's just a matter of time.

89
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
The dirty woman.

90
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
Yes, she's dirty.

91
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Yeah.

92
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
So you gave me a butt plug.

93
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
There you go.

94
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
A glitter butt plug.

95
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,040
It's a, it's a lava lamp that runs on USB.

96
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
That's cool.

97
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
That's, he knows me.

98
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
He gets you.

99
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Yeah, he does.

100
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
He knows that you need a little pizzazz.

101
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Very nice.

102
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Didn't we do, didn't we do a show?

103
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Was that a blogger con?

104
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Remember we sat in a room with Dave Weiner?

105
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
We didn't record it.

106
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
No, we should have.

107
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
I really busted Dave that time.

108
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,040
I walked in when he said, oh, we're totally fucked on.

109
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
What?

110
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Yeah, Dave just said that.

111
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
And I was like, I don't remember that.

112
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Oh, he told us that.

113
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
Yeah.

114
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
I was like, oh, what'd you write?

115
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Yeah, it was like a slide right in.

116
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Hello.

117
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
Busty.

118
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
What was he talking about?

119
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Fucking me.

120
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Like as insects or business.

121
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
No, sex.

122
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,040
You really?

123
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
I'm going to sign our dish.

124
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
Should contract.

125
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
No, it's like sugar over.

126
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
That's what I was saying.

127
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
I know.

128
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
I felt like you're shit.

129
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,040
I thought you were talking about sex.

130
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
No.

131
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,040
And now I'm doing this show for three years.

132
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Oh.

133
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Yeah.

134
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Sign in blood.

135
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,040
I forget what happened after that though.

136
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
I was probably like, you wish.

137
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Okay.

138
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
That was a long time ago.

139
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,040
That was actually the first time that we met you.

140
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,040
I decided that I liked you right away because you said you would totally go to the 3D

141
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
porn with us.

142
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Well, I did.

143
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
I know.

144
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
But like you weren't like, hmm, should I?

145
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
No, I was right there.

146
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
No, I was always honest.

147
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
No hesitation.

148
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
And I'm like, this is a guy we can work with.

149
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,040
And I don't socialize with many people for anything.

150
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
But that was such a great combination.

151
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
You guys in 3D porn.

152
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Remember that guy was doing like porn trivia.

153
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Yeah.

154
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
It's beginning.

155
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
And I knew nothing.

156
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,040
Did it.

157
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,040
One of you win a prize?

158
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Was it Sam?

159
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Sam was with you.

160
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
I thought you wanted CD.

161
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
No.

162
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
No.

163
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Okay.

164
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
I thought somebody wanted a prize.

165
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
A thing of mince that no one could open.

166
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
It might have been Sam.

167
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
That's right.

168
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
The thing of mince.

169
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Yeah.

170
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
So I didn't recall.

171
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Did we all spend 20 minutes being like, this fucking mince.

172
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Yeah.

173
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
No, in 2 months, that was 3 years.

174
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Wow.

175
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Wow.

176
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
Did you guys still have them fun?

177
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Yeah.

178
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Can you tell?

179
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Yeah.

180
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
I don't know.

181
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Just check them.

182
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
You can sure.

183
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
So the expo is always kind of interesting.

184
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,040
This year it feels like they're not up.

185
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,040
They don't want any shenanigans here.

186
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
The hotels.

187
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Oh, yes.

188
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
Yeah, more security.

189
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
It's the rowdy podcasters though.

190
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Well, they probably thought we don't need any security for the other

191
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
thing.

192
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,040
I know that the pod show specifically has, you know, that the word is out within a three-mile

193
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
radius.

194
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Don't let them do anything.

195
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,040
I don't give them hotel rooms.

196
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Nothing.

197
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
You know.

198
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
So.

199
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Yeah.

200
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
What kind of say?

201
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
That's your fault.

202
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
You're the riffrath.

203
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,040
That's funny because if you go to, like,

204
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Comdex, you know, or any other trade show.

205
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
And I have to say Vegas.

206
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
You'll see when the show goes to Vegas.

207
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Everyone's going to just be partying because that's what trade shows are.

208
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Yeah.

209
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Yeah.

210
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
You go party.

211
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm sorry.

212
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
But, you know, the award show.

213
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
That wasn't a party to me.

214
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,040
That, you know, we went to the award show here.

215
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
Yeah.

216
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,040
And it was like, kind of, like a photo op.

217
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
It really was.

218
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
So it couldn't hear anything.

219
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
No.

220
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
The room was way too big.

221
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Yeah.

222
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
The room was too big for the acoustics.

223
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Yeah.

224
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
They weren't on stage.

225
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
I mean, that's good.

226
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
You couldn't see anything.

227
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
Right.

228
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,040
If anything, I would feel quite insulted if I had come here to receive an award.

229
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
I'm like, fuck that.

230
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Yeah.

231
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
No red carpet.

232
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
It was fucking Joan Rivers.

233
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,040
I had to talk about my outfit.

234
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
There you go.

235
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
No, it's damn.

236
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
That's no good.

237
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
No.

238
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,040
This was, it seemed like just a little, you know, sight thought.

239
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Like, oh, yeah.

240
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
We got to do the awards.

241
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
This took him in the corner.

242
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
Yeah.

243
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
Yeah.

244
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Because I went, you know, for, for show girls.

245
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Right.

246
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
I wanted to be like clapping and chair and in shape.

247
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
Nice.

248
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Well, honestly, we went too late.

249
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
We missed the actual award.

250
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
But.

251
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
But.

252
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
That was the restaurant's fall.

253
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Yeah.

254
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
That's kind of disappointed.

255
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
So maybe in Vegas.

256
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
It'll be different.

257
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
Yeah.

258
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
I think it's going to be.

259
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Uncontrollable in Vegas.

260
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
I don't know.

261
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Because it's incredible.

262
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,040
I mean, what actually happens?

263
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I mean, did you guys go to any, you didn't go to any of the keynotes or anything?

264
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
No.

265
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Do a lot of people show up for that.

266
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
I mean, I went last year to one.

267
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
And it was a fall.

268
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
It was pretty full.

269
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Yeah.

270
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
I think it was Jason Calcanas.

271
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Right.

272
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Right.

273
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
So I remember going there was the, with Michael actually going.

274
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
But it was a full room.

275
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
So.

276
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Nice.

277
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
She's.

278
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
You don't like that?

279
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
I'm not sure.

280
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Now you don't.

281
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
You're the like one of the girls that doesn't like first.

282
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
No.

283
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,040
I was expecting actually to do like the thing where you put your hand on your forehead in the last place.

284
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
No, it's first.

285
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
No.

286
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
I wasn't sure.

287
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,040
But that would've been really funny if I would've just totally punched you.

288
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
My girls do that.

289
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Patricia.

290
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Patricia.

291
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
That's like the thing on the forehead.

292
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
She does.

293
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Yeah.

294
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Yeah.

295
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
That's a table one night.

296
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
And Patricia can bounce like a fucking truck.

297
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
I see it.

298
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
But.

299
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
And I'm like.

300
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
See.

301
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
That's what I think.

302
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Christina went like that.

303
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Can you get the memo that this game was on here?

304
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Did they find you?

305
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
It's.

306
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
They punched me all the time.

307
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
She's my mother-in-law punches me.

308
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
She really hits me hard.

309
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
And arm all the time.

310
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
That's like a Greek thing.

311
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Maybe you're fun to punch.

312
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
No.

313
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
I don't have the meat your man does.

314
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
I don't.

315
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
He's like a fucking.

316
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
He's chisel.

317
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
He's got.

318
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
He didn't take me much, but I'm lazy.

319
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Yeah.

320
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
No.

321
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
I mean, you've got it.

322
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
You can see that you don't have to.

323
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
He just happens.

324
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Yeah.

325
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
He's like a few worker.

326
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
So we were at the zoo.

327
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
He does.

328
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
We were to do.

329
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
And they had this thing where you can test against.

330
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Like the strength of an orangutan.

331
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Uh-huh.

332
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
And so he beat the orangutan.

333
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
It was easy.

334
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
I was just like it would go right to the top.

335
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
I was squeezing it as hard as I could.

336
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
And I could not even get it 20%.

337
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
I really like it when you squeeze it.

338
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Yeah.

339
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,040
So it's a man with extras.

340
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Yeah.

341
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,040
So, um, are you having fun here at him?

342
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,040
You're having lots of friends, I see.

343
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Making me get jealous left and right.

344
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,040
It is nice to see some women here.

345
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Yeah.

346
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
It did.

347
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,040
The blooddress rushes away from my brain.

348
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
Yeah.

349
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
No, it's nice.

350
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
But, you know, first of all, I love all women.

351
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
You know that.

352
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
I really do.

353
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
I've had to learn to accept it.

354
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
You know, like so.

355
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Yeah, but.

356
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
You have an open relationship.

357
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Yeah.

358
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
It is awkward.

359
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
No, just any woman.

360
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
I love all women.

361
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,040
And particularly when the ratio is still got to be maybe 20%.

362
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,040
I mean, this is a lot less women here than the nerdy guys.

363
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,040
So you kind of like looking and seeing it, scoping out the room who's here.

364
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
And they all just look really beautiful.

365
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Well, next to all these men, yes.

366
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
No.

367
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
bodies.

368
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,040
So, but, you know, and it's kind of, it goes a little bit deeper.

369
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Because, you know, you hear these people.

370
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,040
You have kind of back and forth banter like with you or with Angie.

371
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,040
You know, so then hang out and hug each other.

372
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Yeah.

373
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
I need that.

374
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
I'm tired.

375
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
I'm an old tired dude.

376
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
I need hugs.

377
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
A big time.

378
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Angie swung by and grabbed me in the ass.

379
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
And that needs you.

380
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
But she, okay, so it's not like special.

381
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
I thought I was like the only one.

382
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Sorry.

383
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
I think we're all.

384
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
I got that.

385
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
I was the only one.

386
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Then I was going to hit Don.

387
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
It's Angie.

388
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Does she live with Ryan?

389
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
I have no idea.

390
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
This is like.

391
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
I got to figure this out.

392
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
Are they on item?

393
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
I don't know.

394
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
I think so.

395
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
She was.

396
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
I've always thought so.

397
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
She saw.

398
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
So that's real talking to him.

399
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
And she went right over and busted it up.

400
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Really?

401
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
I almost kneeled behind her.

402
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
No, she's going to put it up.

403
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Did you do that?

404
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Yeah.

405
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Well, I've to ask her.

406
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
So I'll say, like, I'll make it really awkward for her.

407
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,040
I'll say, yeah, that was crazy when you pinch my bottom.

408
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,040
I'll make so are you with that guy?

409
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Yeah.

410
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
It's just like, don't do it to those wingers.

411
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Yeah.

412
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,040
And I'll say, you know, Adam loves tears.

413
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
And we're all really close.

414
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Yeah.

415
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
It's been friends for three years.

416
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Uh-huh.

417
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
I don't know.

418
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Yeah.

419
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Well, that's actually, you know.

420
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Well, you know, that's how I got the contract.

421
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
People wonder.

422
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Yeah.

423
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
That's what they all speculate.

424
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
So what have you seen?

425
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
Have you seen it?

426
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Have you got a minion army?

427
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,040
Do you guys did a dinner in an outburger?

428
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
A little lunch thing.

429
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Yeah.

430
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
Yeah.

431
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
It was really casual.

432
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Everyone.

433
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
We didn't know what our schedule would be like.

434
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Oh, excuse me.

435
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
We'll schedule this.

436
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Well, you know, sometimes there's things to do.

437
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
But this year, it's really chill.

438
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Well, I mean, yeah, there isn't much to do.

439
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Right.

440
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Are there any events?

441
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
So everyone's going to the pool party now.

442
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
That's what they're at right now.

443
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Actually, there's a that culture catch.

444
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
They used to make the same room.

445
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
What is that?

446
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
It was putting who's sponsored.

447
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
I think extreme prizes part of that too.

448
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
There's a bunch of sponsors.

449
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
There's a ton of people.

450
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,040
And it's going to be, I'm kind of interested to see how they're going to do this.

451
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Because it's also like a party that would be cool in San Francisco.

452
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,040
And I'm not sure if they'll be able to execute it in Ontario.

453
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
So what is it like performance arts?

454
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,040
There's going to be a, yeah, there's going to be a band.

455
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,040
There's going to be belly dancers and trepies with tissue.

456
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
I saw on the ceiling.

457
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
And it's going to be in that in that small room.

458
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,040
So they better have a lot of, because it's going to look really lame in that in the

459
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
size.

460
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
And you know how the bands are being too big.

461
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
Yeah.

462
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
And you got to have a lot of talent.

463
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
So that is not it.

464
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,040
It's probably his other girlfriend.

465
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
You think, let's speculate.

466
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Did you say speculate?

467
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,040
I'm sorry.

468
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,040
I'm sorry.

469
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
Okay.

470
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,040
Very much.

471
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
All right.

472
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,040
He's totally.

473
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
So peanut paper.

474
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
I'm like.

475
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
He's not smoking.

476
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
He's not smoking.

477
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
I don't know why they put me in a non smoking floor.

478
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,040
And it doesn't smell of pot or anything.

479
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,040
And the guy's like, actually, this makes a lot of sense.

480
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
So we're smoking pot in my room.

481
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Guy knocks on the door and says, chocolate.

482
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,040
I mean, is this awesome hotel?

483
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Why?

484
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
And here's that chocolate.

485
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
And I'm like, what the fuck is he saying?

486
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
He said, chocolate.

487
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Help him up.

488
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
He says, chocolate.

489
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
It's really good.

490
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Yeah.

491
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
What is this?

492
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
It's nice.

493
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
It's minty.

494
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
It's minty.

495
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
It's so refreshing.

496
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Yeah.

497
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
Rottie.

498
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,040
Yeah.

499
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
There's candy here.

500
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Right now, everyone's like, I wonder if Andy's on a new sponsor for this.

501
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Yeah.

502
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Yeah.

503
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Totally man.

504
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Those guys like ruin in the show was advertised.

505
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
Yeah.

506
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
It was somebody's like, it sounds good.

507
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
Yeah.

508
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
And this is what I have yours right here.

509
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
The fourth one is right here.

510
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
There's one more for you guys.

511
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
I'm going to take all that back.

512
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
That's it about the hotel.

513
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
No, right here.

514
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Don't eat your chocolate.

515
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Mm-hmm.

516
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
It's probably here to do turn down.

517
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Yeah.

518
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,040
I guess for him, you know, he doesn't actually turn on the bed.

519
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
It just throws him chocolate on.

520
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Any wake up, you think you should sit yourself.

521
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
I never happened to you in a hotel.

522
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
I thought she was like that.

523
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Probably sleep on the fucking chocolate.

524
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Yeah.

525
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
Oh yeah.

526
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
That's really bad.

527
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Right after you went to the Bean Burrito store.

528
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Yeah.

529
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Yeah.

530
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Yeah.

531
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Yeah.

532
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
Yeah.

533
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
I want to have to share because the mini bars.

534
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Oh.

535
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Oh.

536
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Thank you.

537
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Oh.

538
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
All right.

539
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Chocolate ice cream.

540
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
That was pretty good.

541
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Yeah.

542
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Dark chocolate.

543
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
You guys didn't stop recording it, did you?

544
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
No.

545
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
No.

546
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
How long did you frozen this?

547
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Yeah.

548
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Excuse me.

549
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
How long did you frozen this?

550
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
About 25 minutes.

551
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Something like that.

552
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Yeah.

553
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
It goes with the flow.

554
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Sometimes I feel like it can go longer.

555
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
Sometimes you can't.

556
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Sometimes you have to cut the show short.

557
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
No, not often.

558
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Very rarely.

559
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Yeah.

560
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Nice.

561
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
So, okay.

562
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
You've been podcasting longer than mostly everybody here.

563
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Although you're catching up to me 6.46.

564
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
I know.

565
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Yeah.

566
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
I just can't.

567
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
This really bumps me out.

568
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
That's the one thing I really hate.

569
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
I just don't have the time.

570
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,040
And really the energy after the number hours to do a show.

571
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Right.

572
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
Really pisses me off.

573
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,040
But I mean, you're building the company.

574
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,040
So the other people can do it.

575
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
Agreed.

576
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
But you just finished 6.6 right?

577
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
Yeah.

578
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,040
But even for that, you know, I would have loved to know a lot more production and stuff like that.

579
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
I just don't have the time.

580
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
I just don't have the time.

581
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
I want to do something.

582
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Yeah.

583
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
We're 20 away from you.

584
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
We should get on that now.

585
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Let's have videos.

586
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
We don't count the numbers on the videos.

587
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Yeah.

588
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Yeah.

589
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
I heard you did really nice on the San Francisco office.

590
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
I haven't seen it yet.

591
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
I want some people mention that.

592
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
You were in it.

593
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
But you had your back to us.

594
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Yeah.

595
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
You were with Moody.

596
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Oh, really?

597
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
In Wisconsin.

598
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Yeah.

599
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
Yeah.

600
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm like, I'm Rock Moody.

601
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,040
After I saw that, I thought, why didn't I just bang on the door and be like,

602
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
I love you.

603
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
I'm angry.

604
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Really?

605
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Because I would have tunged you.

606
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Yeah.

607
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
No, totally.

608
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
But you know, I get to the office.

609
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,040
And I get kind of intimidated because it's so professional and so business-like.

610
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Really?

611
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
You think so?

612
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,040
I mean, everyone's working.

613
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
Not stuffy.

614
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
No.

615
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
No.

616
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Everyone's working.

617
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Yeah.

618
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
I mean, they're busy.

619
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
But everyone's excited when you guys come.

620
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
I mean, that's like two days ahead of time.

621
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
I want to run it around like you don't do a cop.

622
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
I'm not kidding.

623
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
It was really exciting.

624
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
I don't know.

625
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
I don't know.

626
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,040
Yeah.

627
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
I don't know.

628
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
It means to like engineers.

629
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,040
They're building shit that, you know, we don't want to think about.

630
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
You know, shit just kind of works.

631
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Kind of.

632
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
Right.

633
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
And you see a lot of people that do that.

634
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Yeah.

635
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
But we've seen the demo of the what the stuff they're working on.

636
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
So it's like a new stuff.

637
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Yeah.

638
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Yeah.

639
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
So for you guys, for them to present that.

640
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
That's a big deal.

641
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
You know?

642
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
That's a good connection.

643
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,040
I wish I could get more.

644
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,040
And more of the talent and stuff like that together with the company.

645
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,040
And it's just geographically challenging.

646
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
Sure.

647
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
And just the time that goes into it.

648
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,040
But there's a lot of people at work trying to.

649
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Trying to make it easier for us.

650
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
Better.

651
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Don, you're looking at me like.

652
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Fuck this.

653
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
No.

654
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
I'm just like listening.

655
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Good.

656
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Give me a look.

657
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
No.

658
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
Everyone who don't totally was awesome.

659
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Going this award show because I felt so unhappy about walking.

660
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
It's not.

661
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Yeah.

662
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
I know everyone wants to say something.

663
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
And you know what's the talk.

664
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
And then someone else interrupts.

665
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,040
And then, you know, just feel, you know what it is.

666
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
Yeah.

667
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
It's weird.

668
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
It's very difficult.

669
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
But then we kind of walked in arm and arm.

670
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
And that was like that.

671
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Just let us alone.

672
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
It's nice.

673
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
You know, I'm like Adam.

674
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
It's like we're at prom.

675
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Yeah.

676
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Totally.

677
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Totally.

678
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Yeah.

679
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Just strange.

680
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
So do you.

681
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
So when we're at the expo.

682
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
Like tang out with you.

683
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
We usually have to hang out in small groups.

684
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Yeah.

685
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
I don't usually see them big like clusters and stuff.

686
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Because it just disappoints everyone.

687
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
And tires me out.

688
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Sure.

689
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Totally.

690
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Yeah.

691
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
You can't just everyone wants to say something.

692
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
They'll be waiting and hovering.

693
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
And you know.

694
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
And then people are recording your conversations.

695
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
These.

696
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Yeah.

697
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
This is pretty weird.

698
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
The video like two.

699
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Five video cameras.

700
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Well, I just talk into someone.

701
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
That's really uncomfortable.

702
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Right.

703
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Yeah.

704
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
I'm not having a real conversation.

705
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
I'm totally posing for the camera.

706
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
I'm looking like the pod father.

707
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,040
You know, I'm not actually listening about the fuck you say it.

708
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,040
So that's hard.

709
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Yeah.

710
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
But some people even have their rigs.

711
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Like that justine girl.

712
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Mm-hmm.

713
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,040
He's like sending it right there.

714
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Yeah.

715
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
She's live all the chicken.

716
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
What's your purse?

717
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
She got a fucking backpack.

718
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Yeah.

719
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Like a whole wife.

720
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
I know she's like transmitting it.

721
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
And I'm thinking like.

722
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Yeah.

723
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Yeah.

724
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
I want to be though because it was like she's shooting from the worst angle.

725
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
First of all.

726
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
Yeah.

727
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
She's not very tall.

728
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Yeah.

729
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
And then.

730
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
She's shooting it from like so low.

731
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Yeah.

732
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
And I thought.

733
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Oh, that's going to look fucking at you.

734
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
That's a little light situation.

735
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Yeah.

736
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
I don't know if that was going to work at all.

737
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
But she's cute, right?

738
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
She wants everybody to look worse.

739
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
No.

740
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
She's, I don't think it was light there.

741
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
True.

742
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Well, the other guy wears it on his hat.

743
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Yeah.

744
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
So it's like eye level.

745
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Just like girls.

746
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
I bet girls wouldn't do that.

747
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
She, I think, had it on a half a while.

748
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
But you're right.

749
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,040
I mean, it's a very shy morgue.

750
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Yeah.

751
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Yeah.

752
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Yeah.

753
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Yeah.

754
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Yeah.

755
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Yeah.

756
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Yeah.

757
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Yeah.

758
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Yeah.

759
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
Yeah.

760
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Yeah.

761
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
Yeah.

762
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Yeah.

763
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Yeah.

764
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
Yeah.

765
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Yeah.

766
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Yeah.

767
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
Yeah.

768
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Yeah.

769
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Yeah.

770
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Yeah.

771
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Yeah.

772
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Yeah.

773
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Yeah.

774
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Yeah.

775
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Yeah.

776
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
Yeah.

777
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Yeah.

778
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
Yeah.

779
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Yeah.

780
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
And I think it's like a real blue tooth head set.

781
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
And it actually exists.

782
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,040
And we're actually kind of getting that way.

783
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
I mean, we live in science fiction.

784
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Sure.

785
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
For real.

786
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Yeah.

787
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Totally.

788
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Yeah.

789
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
or just D&TV?

790
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
I don't.

791
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
No.

792
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
I've looked a few times, you know.

793
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,040
I'll watch it for a while, but I mean, it's been a while.

794
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
I don't think anyone's ever, whenever I see it.

795
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
No one's doing anything that's that interesting.

796
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
They're just sitting in front of the computer.

797
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Right.

798
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Or even at a party to take your kid off at least.

799
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Do something.

800
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
Yeah.

801
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
I don't know.

802
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
They wanted us to do something.

803
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
You know?

804
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
One of us that run a camera.

805
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,040
I don't want to, I don't want to do video all the time like that.

806
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
No.

807
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
It's just two.

808
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,040
It's, I barely have privacy as it is.

809
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Really?

810
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Yeah.

811
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
I mean, like, I'm talking about my life all the time.

812
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Everyone knows, like, I was sick for a while.

813
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
I don't know how many people I've come up to say, like,

814
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
How's the hepatitis A?

815
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
And I'm like, oh, what?

816
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
I'm like, yeah.

817
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
I eat like a sick thing.

818
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Really?

819
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
You ate that?

820
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
I was so sick.

821
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
But it's so good.

822
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
But it's so good.

823
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
What did you call it?

824
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Hepalomode.

825
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
That's what the A's for.

826
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Hepalvan.

827
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
You're probably getting it.

828
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
You're getting it.

829
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,040
I got it from butt-munching, Drew.

830
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Yeah.

831
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Nice.

832
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
Nice.

833
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Have you ever given him the BJ all the way?

834
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Yeah.

835
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Okay.

836
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
I thought it was, yeah.

837
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
I remember him begging for it.

838
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
He always does it.

839
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Exactly.

840
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
If he had ten floor jobs a day, he'd still be like,

841
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Can I have another?

842
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Thank you, man.

843
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Thank you.

844
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Yeah.

845
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Oh, sir.

846
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Oh, you guys killed me.

847
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
You wacky kids.

848
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
All right.

849
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
I'm sure that you're always saying that.

850
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Like, oh, why if I'm back from San Francisco?

851
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
I'm too tired.

852
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Are you ever home?

853
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Yeah.

854
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Yeah.

855
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
How was home last week?

856
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
No.

857
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Oh, well.

858
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,040
But, you know, look.

859
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Now is a good time to do this.

860
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,040
You know, because Christina's 17, you know,

861
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Yeah, I'm home and like, you know, she has, she lives in an apartment in her house.

862
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Basically, you know, so she's got her own life.

863
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
And Patricia has, you know, she got all kinds of shit.

864
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
She's traveling.

865
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
She's doing her.

866
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,040
She's putting together a big band, like a 17 piece.

867
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Oh, yeah.

868
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
Yeah.

869
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
She has a whole show in mind.

870
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
We've married for 21 years, you know.

871
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,040
It's like, she's okay if I fuck off for a while.

872
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
I was home for three months.

873
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
I was home for a long time.

874
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
Okay.

875
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
But, you know, every single day in the London office,

876
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
we really had to get that going.

877
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
And you come home at four o'clock.

878
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
San Francisco wakes up.

879
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
So you're still on the phone until midnight.

880
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Yeah.

881
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
But, uh, out the fuck.

882
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
I'm saying to come check that off.

883
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Is that, you know, she got a car.

884
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
She totally come.

885
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
We're going to.

886
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Get, we have a plan for that, yeah.

887
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
We're making a calendar up.

888
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
I'm going to write a book.

889
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Yeah.

890
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
I'm a pageal press.

891
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
For a pageal press?

892
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Yep.

893
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Excellent.

894
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
That's, I really believe in that.

895
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
And that's going to be incredibly successful.

896
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
I want your story, actually.

897
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Would you write my story?

898
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
Well, you have to tell me what you say.

899
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Are you serious?

900
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
You just, I just-

901
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
No, let's say it.

902
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
No, this book is about losing your virginity.

903
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
And I'm-

904
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Oh, I got a great deal of losing your virginity story.

905
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Oh, I'm so awesome.

906
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,040
Well, then we'll have to put in the book.

907
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Great idea.

908
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
Yeah.

909
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
And so, hi.

910
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
So, we're going to do audio version.

911
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
We're going to do a podcast that builds up to it.

912
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
And we had a meeting today with Mark.

913
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
You took a meeting.

914
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
I took a meeting.

915
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,040
We took a meeting with Mark.

916
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Yeah.

917
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
And, uh, we're talking about the release and stuff.

918
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,040
And I was like, I had to get out of the story in the book.

919
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Mm-hmm.

920
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
So.

921
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
I was 15.

922
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Does it now?

923
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Yeah.

924
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Okay.

925
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
I just remembered that.

926
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
I remember her name, too.

927
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Okay.

928
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Before we write the book.

929
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Okay.

930
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
We need submissions.

931
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Yeah.

932
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
But we'll be talking about that.

933
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
This was actually-

934
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
I mean, I got to tell a little about story.

935
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
All right.

936
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Give me a little bit.

937
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Just the tip.

938
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
But it was-

939
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
I think-

940
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
The tip is pretty broad.

941
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
I like to hear that.

942
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Yeah.

943
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
I'm trying-

944
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Without giving it all away, it was one of these.

945
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Uh, I had a buddy and-

946
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
And he was older than I was.

947
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
And he had a, um, a girlfriend.

948
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
And he set me up.

949
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,040
So that could, you know.

950
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,040
Have sex with his girlfriend.

951
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Uh, but I had never told him that I'd never done it.

952
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,040
But she figured it out pretty quickly.

953
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Yeah.

954
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Women have that intuition.

955
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Yeah.

956
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
You're fucking the mattress.

957
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Hey, don't-

958
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,040
It was not that bad.

959
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
That's my knee.

960
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
But-

961
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
But one thing I will say.

962
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Did you read that?

963
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,040
It was a girl who writes for new New Yorker magazine, I think.

964
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
And it was-

965
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,040
It kind of flowed through the internet a week or two or so ago.

966
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,040
She wrote this thing that nerds make the best lovers.

967
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Yeah.

968
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,040
And it was a line in there that really agree with, you know,

969
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,040
was it one of the reasons why nerds make really great lovers is because they don't mind reading the manual.

970
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,040
That's so true.

971
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Boy, did I study that shit?

972
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
I got really good at it.

973
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Well, we're going to have to find out all the details.

974
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Oh, yeah.

975
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
For the book.

976
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
I'm all for that.

977
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Very good.

978
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
I think that'll be extremely successful.

979
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
I think so too.

980
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
I'm excited.

981
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
My meeting was very productive.

982
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
We should also do a masturbation book.

983
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Oh, totally.

984
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
I mean, it's like it's endless.

985
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
For really, yeah.

986
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Yeah.

987
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Yeah.

988
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Yeah.

989
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
And that's really-

990
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
There it goes.

991
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
It's in the works.

992
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Cool.

993
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,040
I think Mark's trying to get it done for June.

994
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
Really?

995
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,040
The book has to be done by June?

996
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Yeah.

997
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
More than it all winter.

998
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Okay.

999
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Nice.

1000
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Who else are you going to talk to?

1001
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
A lot.

1002
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
I'm just going to talk to tons of people.

1003
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,040
I want to make sure that I even get a good generation gap too.

1004
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Like I would like to talk to you.

1005
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Just again.

1006
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Yeah.

1007
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,040
I want to get into the slash of the elders.

1008
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
This is wrong.

1009
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
Nice.

1010
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
True.

1011
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
See, Drew can't take my words.

1012
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,040
See, you want some celebrities too?

1013
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Yeah.

1014
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
I mean, well, I just want interesting stories.

1015
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
We just got one.

1016
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
What are you talking about?

1017
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
No.

1018
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
And I'm curious.

1019
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Let me think.

1020
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Yeah.

1021
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
We work on it.

1022
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,040
What's going to be right in the celebrities kind of less important.

1023
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
This is the good story is really what you want.

1024
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
Right.

1025
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
I wonder how many different stories there are.

1026
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
I must be tons.

1027
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Everybody's got one.

1028
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Yeah.

1029
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
How about you?

1030
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Me.

1031
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
Yeah.

1032
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
I got sorry for the book.

1033
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Thank you.

1034
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Thank you.

1035
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
All right.

1036
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Well, we got to get out of here.

1037
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
We got to get out of here.

1038
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
We got to let Adam get back to making the way source code.

1039
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Yeah.

1040
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
That was a slight point.

1041
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Yeah.

1042
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Yeah.

1043
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
This has been awkward since you didn't have pants on.

1044
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,040
And you're dripping the whole time.

1045
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Oh.

1046
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Oh.

1047
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
You're dripping the whole time.

1048
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Oh.

1049
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Well, thank you for the chocolate.

1050
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Sure.

1051
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
And the water.

1052
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Great.

1053
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
That's pod shows.

1054
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Maybe we have a chocolate.

1055
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
It's a water.

1056
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,040
If you're a pod guest, you're in your thinking about signing with pod gel.

1057
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Just think about the water and chocolate.

1058
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,040
You'll get.

1059
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,040
And you can be best friends with Adam Curry, which comes with every single contract.

1060
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Right.

1061
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
We had to add that, remember.

1062
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Oh, that was our clause.

1063
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah.

1064
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
We got to be best friends.

1065
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
You guys are great.

1066
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
And I appreciate it.

1067
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
What you've done.

1068
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Seriously.

1069
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Thank you.

1070
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Thank you.

1071
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Yeah.

1072
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Did that sounds interesting?

1073
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Yeah.

1074
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Okay.

1075
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
Not too.

1076
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
Just somewhat sincere.

1077
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
All right.

1078
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
You guys.

1079
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Well, thanks for listening.

1080
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Adam, thank you so much for being on the show.

1081
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Thank you guys.

1082
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
We have to promote anything.

1083
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Do you want to promote your show?

1084
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Yeah.

1085
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Do you have a podcast?

1086
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Don't we have a sponsor?

1087
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
No.

1088
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
We don't have any sponsors.

1089
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
We have a sponsor?

1090
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
No.

1091
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
I can't believe you paid you guys.

1092
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
I know.

1093
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
That's what we're always saying.

1094
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
Please.

1095
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
We have some tequila thing coming up.

1096
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Yeah.

1097
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Oh, that's going to be cool.

1098
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
I heard the sponsor that today.

1099
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
It's going to be pretty cool.

1100
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Don't we have some...

1101
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
There's some other...

1102
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,040
There's a lot coming down.

1103
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
You know, we...

1104
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Now we have 8 to the B.

1105
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
And we've got...

1106
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Yeah, we're...

1107
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Our shit's kind of squaring up a little bit.

1108
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
You know, we've...

1109
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
There's...

1110
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
It's not as painful.

1111
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,040
It's the square peg in the round ball thing.

1112
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
I see more like the star hole.

1113
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
I see the star.

1114
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Can I see that?

1115
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,040
I did a hypoxia test.

1116
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Do you know what that is?

1117
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
No.

1118
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
What a hypoxia is.

1119
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Is if you fly above 10,000 feet for...

1120
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
I don't know if you go even higher than it happens quicker.

1121
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
It's one that's just no oxygen.

1122
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
And you eventually you die.

1123
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
See, it's no big deal.

1124
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
I mean, that's...

1125
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
That's why your...

1126
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Your plane is pressurized and everything.

1127
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,040
And if you're above 10,000 feet or like a 10 or 12,000,

1128
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
you shouldn't do it for more than 30 minutes.

1129
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Legally, I think, and you have to go back down to 7 or 8.

1130
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
Okay.

1131
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Because there's less...

1132
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
You know, the air is thinner.

1133
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,040
So there's less actual oxygen.

1134
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,040
And what happens is you start to get really stupid.

1135
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
And it's really dangerous because, you know,

1136
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
you can be in flying in there's a situation.

1137
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
It's like being stone.

1138
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
You kind of sit there and like...

1139
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Okay.

1140
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
You know, so they give you the...

1141
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
the square in the peg game.

1142
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,040
We'll have to like, three minutes, right?

1143
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Okay.

1144
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
Now put the pegs in the right hole.

1145
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
You're like...

1146
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Like, yeah, I could totally not fly.

1147
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
No, I could fly.

1148
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
I know I could fly.

1149
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
You know, so...

1150
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Anyway.

1151
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
So how'd you do in the test?

1152
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Well, no, it's three minutes and then you're stupid.

1153
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Then they put you back on oxygen.

1154
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Otherwise, you're just, you know, you'll pass out.

1155
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,040
Yeah.

1156
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
You know, that's happened.

1157
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
That happens to me when I fly.

1158
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
No.

1159
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Every time I wake up, what's it called?

1160
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
Well, even just take off.

1161
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,040
I just have to...

1162
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Any kind of bank.

1163
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
You pass out of it.

1164
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
Really?

1165
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
I'm always like this whole catcher from hitting the head of the side.

1166
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Every time.

1167
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
Every time we fly.

1168
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
As soon as I feel the bank, I got a really...

1169
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
I just lack of...

1170
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
You're not afraid of flying the world yet.

1171
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
No, no.

1172
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
No, it's not either the panic thing.

1173
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
No, just...

1174
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
I just can't...

1175
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Stay awake.

1176
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
No.

1177
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
I just said the blood to the other bank.

1178
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Really?

1179
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
My doctors are perplexed.

1180
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
Oh.

1181
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
But they're like, well, just don't become a pilot.

1182
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Yeah.

1183
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
I'm like, okay.

1184
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
No worries then.

1185
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
All right.

1186
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
So...

1187
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
All right.

1188
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
We'll let you get back to...

1189
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
So, six, six, six.

1190
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
We tried.

1191
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
We shoot for London.

1192
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Okay.

1193
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
Don't tease me like that.

1194
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Oh.

1195
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
We're in 20 shows.

1196
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
That's four weeks.

1197
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Okay.

1198
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
Something like that.

1199
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Okay.

1200
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
I don't think we can...

1201
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
You'll like back...

1202
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Five, six hundred.

1203
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Okay.

1204
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Six, nine, do nine.

1205
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
We'll shoot for London.

1206
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
All right.

1207
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Well, that would be cool.

1208
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
Or we're in.

1209
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Because it's right around Halloween, actually.

1210
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Six, six.

1211
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
We're trying to make it Halloween.

1212
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
All right.

1213
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
We'll...

1214
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
We'll make it happen somehow.

1215
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
For that show.

1216
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
All right, sweetie.

1217
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Thanks for being the show.

1218
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
