00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey, this is Michael Butler from the Rock and Roll Geek Show.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Check out one of my favorite TV shows this summer,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Bow Dog Music Battle of the Band.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's a competition with Johnny Rotten as one of the judges,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and that is quality television, my friends.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Find out more at bowdog.tv slash battle.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And now a man who's not afraid to dig through shit for technology.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Adam Curry in the DSC 650 set.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm just kidding.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's Adam Curry.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You've got a boatman in the back home, and I tell the fuck for you.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I need love, love.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Take ease, my man.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I need to find a man.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Someone to call, man.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But mama said, okay, hurry, love.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, you just have to wait.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
She said it out, don't go easy.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a game of give and take.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You're okay, hurry, love.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No, you just have to wait.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You gotta trust, give the time.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't matter.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If I'm wrong, it takes me a little bit.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That keeps me hanging on me for a minute.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
To let me live again.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Right now, we know nothing.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That keeps me hanging on.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
When I feel my skin.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, it's almost done.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I remember mama said.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She said it out, don't go easy.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You know, it's a game of give and take.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're along the highway.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm much more than I take.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If I'm wrong, it takes me a little bit.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're okay, hurry, love.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, you just have to wait.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That keeps me hanging on me for a minute.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I know information for a lot.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
To come on.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But when I feel the eye.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't go.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
These precious words keep me hanging on.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I remember mama said.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Cover your mouth, okay?

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wake well, breathe out and take mix.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That keeps me hanging on.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't get me for a family

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
To let me live again

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Right, I'll leave all of my life

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That keeps me hanging on it

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But I feel my skin

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, it's almost over

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I remember my mistakes

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh my god

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh my god

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
DJ Early Bird

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Mashes it up

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Discovered on mashuptown.com

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's a classic mashup

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I have to say it took me a little while to get used to it

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But I know I just can't get this thing out of my head

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In fact, that's exactly what it says

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
On the posting on mashuptown.com

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Queens, a hard life

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And the Supremes, you can't hurry

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Love and you heard it here on episode number

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What do we?

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
657 of the daily source code coming to you

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
From the affluent suburb of Surrey

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Known as Gilford on the west side of G-town

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
In the curry manner

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I got to adjust a little bit of my microphone settings here

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I was at...

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hold on a second

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let me just do this

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay, how's that?

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's a little better

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, and Mark Yoshimura Namcoff is doing some kind of musical

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And he's asking lots of people around the network

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
To sing songs and he gave me some like a boy band song

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
To sing and so I've been reconfiguring my entire studio

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
To basically come up with a better recording of me sounding like shit

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And off-key

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Patricia came up the other night

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Say what the hell are you doing?

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Because you know, I'd smartly close the doors

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I'd locked everything down

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I'd like...

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't want the actual singer in the household

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
To hear what I'm doing

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
She said, you know what it is?

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're not sure of yourself

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And you really...

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
When I'm gone and she's gone right now, by the way

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's when you just got a way loud and see if you can really

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Just put the emotion into the song

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Well, I can't wait to do that

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's gonna be...

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What is it?

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hellway musical too

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Something like that

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't know what he's up to

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But the song's pretty funny

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So I'm definitely gonna be a part of that

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Sorry about yesterday I'd forewarned you

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That I probably wasn't gonna come up with a show

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And of course that prediction held true man

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He was busy, I was in London

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I met up with my...

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
My new buddy Ray Santilly Ray

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I gotta get Ray on this show

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He is without a doubt

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
A savant of conspiracy

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And he puts out...

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
In fact, Ray Santilly, if you google this guy

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You'll see that he was the mastermind

126
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Behind the alien autopsy video

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you remember that film

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I think it was fox that aired it in a big special

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It was aired around the world huge

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Huge publicity he made a ton of money on it

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And he to this day he's still not tell anyone

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Including myself whether it was really true or not

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I think from looking at it it was pretty clear

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Wasn't

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But he's got all kinds of awesome stuff

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And you were working on the Lost Elvis Diaries with him

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So how to nice lunch with him

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And then actually you put together two shows

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That are going to air here in the UK

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
One which will be very applicable

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Particularly also for expats

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you're interested in UK sports

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Bill Bradley who's pretty well known

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Newspaper editor, sports editor

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He's going to do a show for his kicking off

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
End of September I think beginning of October

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And another one which I'm very excited about

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Is the star babes

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The daily star

150
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a, I'd call it a tabloid newspaper

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That comes out daily here in the UK

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And they've got, you know, just like the sun has a

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
A beautiful babe on page three

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And we're going to be doing a show about all of these page three

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Babes

156
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now it's not only that

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
There is, I mean I'm not going to tell you about it

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But it's good

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I think it'll go beyond the traditional slow moes

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Of half naked chicks

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Which of course is a big part of the format

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But there's more to it when I entirely that shallow

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hey out of my love you

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I have, you're kind of a contrast rate with the trencha

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You just got a letter B

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hang, you're always imposing this

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That I'm a correctiner

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
2007 man

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He's got a letter E D

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
B

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
B

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
B

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
B

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
B

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
B

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I was thinking about that

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't think really do I come across that way

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
When the lady and I are on the show

179
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And then I kind of came to the conclusion

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, particularly Sunday show

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Now here's what happens, you know, but we are

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Without a doubt

183
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Completely

184
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We're sparring partners

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And, you know, Patricia will sit down sometimes

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
By the way, she sits down with the full intent

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Just to fuck with me and get me angry

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And she'll tell me later

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, I was just fucking with you

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Get angry because it's so funny when you're angry

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And I think that

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That we essentially

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We're always sparring against each other

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So maybe that on the show

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I was trying to drag some kind of response out of her

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's a possibility

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And also I have to say that you know

198
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Having been on vacation with my sister for a week

199
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Patricia was speaking full on Dutch

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
With with Willow

201
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I think that the language in the house was pretty much Dutch

202
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Some English

203
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And it does take a while to kind of get back into it

204
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So I was maybe trying to prod her along

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And poke her a little bit

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And you know, and just elicit some form of response

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Which I think I was successful at once again

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Because I really did like the show

209
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But believe me, man

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I got none to say around here

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
My wife is totally in charge of everything

212
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Ruhiro Sart

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Ruhiro Sart

214
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Has been tracking Google counts of the word podcast for me

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Ever since the word came out

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And if you've been around long enough

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You remember about two or three years ago

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Google would consistently say

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Could not find the word podcast

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And it would say did you mean broadcast

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And it mean while there were millions of hits

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Today the word podcast results in 128 million

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Google hits

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The word pod show

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
1.3 million Google hits

226
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Adam Curry does a respectable 2.35 million

227
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And what iPhone

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
1.46 million

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes, let's talk about that for a second

230
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So the iPhone still

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Has not completely come back to life

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Other than that everything seems to be working

233
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I can call it it'll indicate it'll ring

234
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I can't answer because the touch screen

235
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No longer functions

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And I have a feeling the touch screen is not going to come back

237
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That thing is so sensitive

238
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If there's some moisture stuck somewhere on the side of the screen

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
In between the casing or some of the connectors

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That I'm sure everything got wet

241
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No doubt about that

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Maybe that's just turning to crud and sludge

243
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Because you know it was a pre-flushed drop

244
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So

245
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
They just may never come back to life

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
However

247
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I must say

248
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Apple's coming out with a big announcement

249
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Was it September 5th

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So that would be Wednesday

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And everyone is saying this is going to be the new iPods

252
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And I'm thinking to myself

253
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And this is a part of a bigger

254
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
A bigger statement

255
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I want to make about how much I miss web browsing on the iPhone

256
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Would it be possible that Apple would put together an iPod

257
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That has the same touch screen technology

258
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Has

259
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You know all the fantastic new iPod features in interface

260
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That I like quite a bit on on the iPhone

261
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But also just throwing a Wi-Fi transceiver

262
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Of course it'll be an OS 10-based iPod

263
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I would presume it's going to be based on the new operating system

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They know how to put it into a small little box

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And

266
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And just give us some surfing capabilities

267
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And then maybe

268
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You know maybe open it up a little bit

269
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So we could load some other apps

270
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Wouldn't that be interesting

271
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So just give me the iPod with the web browsing

272
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
With Wi-Fi

273
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And enable developers to develop

274
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Just like they've been doing for OS X in general

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh man, would that make me happy

276
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I believe that I would go for probably

277
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It would be a little bit bigger than the iPhone

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I would presume

279
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Just a little bigger area

280
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Screen size

281
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I would totally go for that

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I would use two devices

283
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't have to have the phone in the iPhone

284
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
In fact if anything that's the part that

285
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I kind of like the least

286
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Although a phone is a phone

287
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's not that big a deal

288
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But going back to the Nokia E61I

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Has been

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well this is where you see

291
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It really is in the small little detail

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So first of all let me just say

293
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm a full believer in

294
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
In a mobile web browser

295
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That shows you the context of the entire page

296
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You've gone to

297
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But easily lets you navigate and zoom in

298
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
On pieces that are relevant

299
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Because going back to the old way

300
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And looking at the

301
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You know at the especially

302
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Formatted for your device screens

303
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Oh man it just does not give you the context

304
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Even email

305
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Even though I know it's

306
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You know emails the same

307
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's the same basic thing

308
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But not being able to see

309
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You know a big portion of the inbox

310
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
At the same you know at one glance

311
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And I keep seeing my left hand

312
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Or my right hand

313
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Reach out to the screen

314
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I want to do the pinch move

315
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
To zoom in on something

316
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Or just double tap something

317
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And it's just a no go

318
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I must say there is some solace

319
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You see who sent me this

320
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It was

321
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh crap

322
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We finally find it

323
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Andrew Harron

324
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Andrew

325
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Awesome dude

326
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He sent me a link to

327
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The new mini opera

328
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Beta

329
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Version of the opera browser

330
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I've actually

331
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I've installed the mini opera

332
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Browser on the on the Nokia before

333
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The new beta version has

334
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Well has

335
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You know one of those kind of like features

336
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a bit like the iPhone

337
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Where if you go to a page

338
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It shows you the entire page

339
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And you have a little box that's connected to your

340
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
To your cursor to your mouse

341
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Which you control with the

342
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You know the foresighted button in the middle

343
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So you can serve to a spot

344
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Click on it

345
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And it will just like the iPhone

346
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
iPhone zoom into that spot

347
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And if you click back it then

348
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Zoom's out

349
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And it's not exactly the same

350
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But it does give you that context

351
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And I have to say

352
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm liking that a lot

353
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Of course the the opera mini browser

354
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Give you no way to import your existing bookmarks

355
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Which sucks

356
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't understand why they wouldn't just put that in there

357
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Make it so much easier

358
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So I'm going to try this for a while

359
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Because I've been feeling that the iPhone

360
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's not going to come back to life

361
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And I'm probably going to wait until after

362
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
September 5th to see what this big announcement

363
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Is before I invest in an iPhone

364
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
In a secondary unit

365
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Looks like someone's

366
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Like a couple of people

367
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I've got some software to unlock it

368
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So you can put it on to a different network

369
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's kind of cool

370
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
We knew that was coming

371
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It'll be very interesting to see what happens

372
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
September 5th

373
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
If there's going to be something beyond

374
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Just another iPod

375
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If there's going to be something special to it

376
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Because really

377
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That web browsing

378
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I miss it

379
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's all it's the little things that make life so enjoyable

380
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
With Apple products in general

381
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I have to say it's just the finesse

382
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's just the rounded edges

383
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It is the walnut dashboard

384
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Or fascia

385
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
As we would say in the automobile business

386
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It is the leather custom fittings

387
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's all about that

388
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's about how the Wi-Fi seamlessly

389
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Switches back and forth between the 3G network

390
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Or the edge network

391
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Who gives a shit?

392
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The mobile network

393
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That ease the way it just happens

394
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And Nokia

395
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Here's the one thing I hate

396
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
This is the nuance

397
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Whenever

398
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Let's say I'm in the bathroom

399
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Of course the most dangerous place for any mobile phone

400
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And I'm looking at web pages

401
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And I'm just on the edge of my Wi-Fi coverage

402
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
When it can't connect

403
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It'll give you a beep

404
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's not like a nice little tone

405
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Just a beep

406
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Just a horrible, horrible sound

407
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If it disconnects you go

408
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It just rotates

409
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's those little things

410
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And don't pop up this dialogue box

411
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I can't click away for three seconds

412
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
All that stuff is just shit

413
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And that of course is it's not Nokia per se

414
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's the symbion operating system

415
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's a lot left to be desired

416
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But really it is all about those

417
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Those little teeny-winny things

418
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm really really missing the web browsing

419
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And I'm going to play around with this

420
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Opera mini

421
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I have to say

422
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The Opera browser in general seems to be much better

423
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
than what comes a bundled standard

424
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So it could probably get me through the rough spots

425
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Because I am having a hard time

426
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I really do miss my iPhone

427
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Even for all its shortcomings

428
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh man

429
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What is up with that?

430
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Really

431
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm trying to process it

432
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm trying to figure out why

433
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't know

434
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It is something just about the finishing touches

435
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It is all about the little pieces of interface

436
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And I am apparently willing to take on less functionality

437
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Just to be able to get the nice little finishing touches

438
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Curious stuff

439
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I had a big program

440
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I hear from San Francisco

441
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Happy birthday to Christina

442
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It is also my birthday

443
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And I woke up this month

444
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Give a call

445
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
At New London Time

446
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I live in for lunch

447
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Anyway, have a good day

448
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Cheers

449
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Well happy birthday

450
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
For a living program

451
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
To your mom

452
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, Christina had a nice birthday

453
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You know what kind of low key

454
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Most people weren't back from vacation

455
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
On the day of her birthday

456
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It was the bank holiday

457
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So that is kind of a bummer

458
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It is like me

459
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
My birthday is Monday

460
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Which was at Labor Day in the States

461
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And I have always had the same thing

462
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You know, either we weren't back at school yet

463
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Or we just were back at school

464
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And there are always new kids

465
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And I was definitely a little introvert and shy

466
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And so I really wouldn't say anything about it

467
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You didn't know anyone

468
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You couldn't invite anybody over for a party

469
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So kind of like those Virgo babies

470
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
End of August beginning of September

471
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
They all know what I'm talking about

472
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And also you are either precisely the youngest

473
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Or you are going to be precisely the oldest

474
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And in any schooling system

475
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And there you have it

476
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I gave away the fact that I'm traveling on Monday

477
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Not Saturday, not Sunday

478
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Which means yes indeed

479
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The Delta Sierra is done

480
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Hopefully she's going to be brought back on Saturday

481
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So I can do a bit of flying arm

482
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Man, I'm looking forward to that

483
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Now let's open up the phone lines

484
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You know we have a US number in a UK number

485
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And Jingles to go with them

486
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Let's see what's in the voice mail box today

487
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That wasn't anything, how about this?

488
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Hi, this is Christine John with the Defense Department

489
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I had sent a couple of emails

490
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
To Adam about being a keynote speaker

491
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
In our June 4th or 5th

492
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The 2008 conference on the evening and podcasting

493
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I have not heard back yet or nay

494
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Defense Department

495
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah, let's not do the phone number

496
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Hold on a second

497
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
One

498
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Is that it?

499
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Defense Department

500
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I didn't receive any emails from the Defense Department

501
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That's the man

502
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Hold on

503
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Defense

504
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm doing a Gmail search as we speak

505
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Defense Department, let me see

506
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No

507
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
No, no, no, no

508
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I wonder what he sent the email to

509
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Probably adamaccurry.com

510
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Fool

511
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Doesn't the CIA have better information on me than that?

512
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
All right, I will definitely call that guy back

513
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
See what's going on

514
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That could be pretty interesting

515
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm more about

516
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Nokia

517
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
If you have an N95 or an N800

518
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
There's something that we've been working on for a while

519
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't even know what's supposed to talk about this yet

520
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But you should take a look

521
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Especially those of you that have an N95

522
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It seems to be a lot of you

523
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm going to Nokia

524
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Nokia.podshow.com

525
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Take a look at some of the feeds there

526
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I think you want to actually access the

527
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
RSS feed links that are attached to the channels that we made there

528
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But this content

529
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Some of our top shows

530
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It automatically gets transcoded into a suitable format

531
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And I think it works in the video center

532
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
For the N95 has some kind of, I don't have one

533
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So it has some kind of video center

534
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Excuse me

535
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And the N800 I know has one

536
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Whether it's out or not, I'm not sure

537
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So we're testing stuff

538
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
If anyone asks you about that, let's just pretend you didn't hear it from me

539
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay

540
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Back to that

541
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Last Elvis Diaries

542
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So I played you just a little bit of that the other day

543
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't want to play any more of it

544
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But the Diaries start off when Elvis is very young

545
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And what's been very difficult

546
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Has been to find because we basically cast

547
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
The voice of the older Elvis

548
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
In case you were confused, it was actually him

549
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We're looking for a younger Elvis sound alike

550
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And it's been really hard

551
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And before we go out and basically spam Craig's list

552
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
If you think you can do a younger Elvis

553
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm talking like the 20 year old Elvis

554
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If you think you can do his voice, let us know

555
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Because we got a fun project for you to work on

556
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh and you'll get paid

557
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
In peanuts

558
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
For sure

559
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Hi Adam, this is Gilbert

560
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Down in Georgia

561
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm looking to your dilemma with the iPhone

562
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I too have dropped mine many times

563
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Unfortunately for me not into the toilet

564
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But I have dropped it since the slide very easily

565
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Anyway

566
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't know about your

567
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
If you've purchased it by credit card

568
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I know my credit card is such that if I break something

569
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Or lose something or step on it

570
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Or someone steals it with him

571
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
The first

572
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't know

573
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Power many months

574
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Certainly

575
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
For six months

576
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
They will replace it

577
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I have had them replace my card

578
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
For that very reason

579
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So you might check into that

580
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And see if that might solve your problem

581
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But you know

582
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I think the slow motion moment

583
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
As it was

584
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, I'll believe me

585
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Was it a slow motion moment

586
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Big time

587
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Before we get the water

588
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Hey you know what

589
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I've never gotten any of those

590
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I never get the protection stuff on credit cards

591
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah yeah

592
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Thank you buddy

593
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Never

594
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm a firm believer

595
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You probably wind up paying for the device twice

596
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Before something actually happens to it

597
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Christina got a new phone yesterday

598
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Which was a birthday present

599
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And I tried to get it

600
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I tried to push an N95 on

601
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I said look this is what all the cool kids have

602
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
This has got all the shit you want

603
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The great camera etc

604
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And of course

605
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The thing she said was

606
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Is it pink

607
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And I don't believe it comes in pink

608
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Nokey and not known for its stylish pink

609
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Although

610
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Wait a minute

611
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Patricia has a nice stylish pink

612
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Phone

613
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The one that's dicey uses on East Enders

614
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So what did she wind up getting?

615
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It was pretty interesting

616
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's a touch screen phone

617
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh it's a it was of course a

618
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Prada touch screen phone

619
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Made by LG

620
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It feels pretty cheap and kind of plasticky to the touch

621
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But and it doesn't have a

622
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You know the touch screen is really just it

623
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Touch screen no dragging or anything like that

624
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Although you can use the scroll bar

625
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Through touch

626
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But she's really happy with it

627
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
She's like this is like my my my my my my fake iPhone

628
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's a and is and she's really happy with it

629
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
That's pretty interesting

630
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I think that things are the changes are a foot for how we perceive a mobile device

631
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The whole idea of a touch screen

632
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Where you can actually interact with what's going on

633
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Maybe it's even like the multi touch screen

634
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Where do you call them like the the iPhone

635
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We have the pinched drag you know zoom and stuff

636
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I know what

637
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Here's here's what I'm feeling

638
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm feeling

639
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That I'm ready to move back to Apple pretty soon

640
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Now that I can happily run windows

641
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I really only need windows

642
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
100% of every single day

643
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
To use cast blaster

644
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So that we're that'll work fine with with parallels

645
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And and all the other stuff you know the speed now on the new intel

646
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Duo core thing mobile

647
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
He seems to be fine

648
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Um, they're still a bit heavy

649
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I really like the light weightiness of the of the via

650
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But man it just it makes me feel good

651
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I had that's what it is it makes me feel happy and proud to be a computer owner

652
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I can't put it any other way

653
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Maybe it'll happen after the September 5th now

654
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
From the pod sake music network now

655
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You know sometimes

656
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm so far away from your darling

657
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Eli paperboy read and the true love

658
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That's what I want you to do

659
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
While I'm gone

660
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You want to take my love with you

661
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Everywhere you go

662
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I want to take my love baby

663
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Everywhere you go

664
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I want to take my love baby

665
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Everywhere you go

666
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
In a street

667
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And a cry

668
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
When you're alone

669
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
All alone

670
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You want to take my love with you

671
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Everywhere you go

672
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
When I'm gone

673
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So far away

674
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
In your heart

675
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I want to stay

676
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So baby

677
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Keep your mind on me

678
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And we'll have a love

679
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And it's me

680
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
For I don't temptation

681
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Can't surround

682
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But you know how I always go around

683
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You're just gonna take my love with you

684
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Everywhere you go

685
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Come on baby

686
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Take my love with you

687
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Everywhere you go

688
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I want to take my love with you

689
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Everywhere you go

690
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Everywhere you go

691
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Everywhere you go

692
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Everywhere you go

693
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
In a street

694
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And a cry

695
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
When you're alone

696
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
All alone

697
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You've got to take my love with you

698
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Everywhere you go

699
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
All alone

700
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You've got to take my love with you

701
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Everywhere you go

702
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Everywhere you go

703
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Everywhere you go

704
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Everywhere you go

705
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I love you, for what if it's me, but you desire

706
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
All we can make it gone and throw it back

707
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You know you're just not to take my love with you

708
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Everywhere you go, wow, you're on the train

709
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
My love baby, everywhere you go, come on baby

710
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Everywhere you go, you know you need to stop and take my love baby

711
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And now bad for a white boy from Massachusetts, huh?

712
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
He like paper boy Reeve from Boston

713
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
He's got two songs up on the Podsight Music Network

714
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Pretty cool, give him a listen

715
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It is kind of like back to the old days and so

716
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah, like boy, go

717
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
All right, so tomorrow's going to be another nutty day

718
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Because we're just we're kicking ass over here

719
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And it's good because once the asses is kicked everything's in motion

720
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It gives me the time to go piss off for two weeks in the US

721
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Which I'm also really looking forward to there

722
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Once again so many new people at Pod Show

723
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But probably even more exciting

724
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The meeting all the new people and by the way my office is gone

725
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's been taken over, I think they've got five people in there now from QA

726
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
We're still trying to find a suitable new office space for our growth

727
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And the new PodShow.com which has been in development for

728
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Well really from over two and a half years

729
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But I've been playing around with some of the development stuff

730
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I've got access to it from here

731
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You know what, it's really blowing me away

732
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I think that the whole channel editor, the whole cheddar exercise

733
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Really inspired a lot of people it feels like

734
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
There's a vision now

735
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And when you look at this thing

736
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You're going to say this is just like

737
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And you won't be able to compare it to anything

738
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You've never seen anything like it before

739
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
The best part of the whole interface

740
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Well besides that it's a great discovery mechanism

741
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You can see how you're connected to content

742
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And who else is connected to it

743
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So you really, you can visualize the community around the show

744
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Which is freaking awesome

745
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But also there's this pervasive play thing going on

746
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And if anything, I've always wanted to have something like this

747
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Where you can be playing a show

748
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It can be audio, it can be video

749
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It doesn't take videos in example

750
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And you want to surf around and find other stuff

751
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So you're looking at the show notes

752
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Just doing tons of other things

753
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I've always despised the fact that I would have to open up another tab

754
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Or open a new window to go look at things

755
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And of course invariably if you click on the link or something's playing

756
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It stops playing

757
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And when you go back you have to find where you were

758
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You know all that crap right

759
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I think we've really looked that problem

760
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And you'll see a lot of, oh man you'll see it

761
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You'll see it

762
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I don't know, it's probably going to be

763
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm going to be careful

764
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'd say it's, they've got a good another two months of work

765
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
At least but maybe some of this stuff will start slipping out in the meantime

766
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And I'm really excited about it

767
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It is taking, it is really taking podshow.com to a whole new level

768
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And it'll work of course for the entire internet

769
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And that's all kinds of cool shit in there

770
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So I'm looking forward to hooking up with the team

771
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And doing some brainstorming

772
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But it's just looking awesome, I'm very excited about this

773
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Alright everybody

774
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So tomorrow as I said it's going to be pretty busy

775
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
All the way through the evening I probably won't get home until 10

776
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Friday should be okay

777
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
If not there's always the weekend

778
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And if I get in Monday night

779
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Maybe Monday night I think we're going to work on the night shift

780
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
For the shows from San Francisco

781
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So Monday night I'll do one for Tuesday

782
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And then maybe before I leave Sunday I'll do one for Monday

783
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Something like that

784
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And I'm going to have lots to talk about

785
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
A guarantee it

786
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
