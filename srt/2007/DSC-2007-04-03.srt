6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Fantastic, it's Adam Curry.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello!

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Adam!

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't know who this is.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't know who this is.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I don't know who this is.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't know who this is.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't know who this is.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know who this is.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't know who this is.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't know who this is.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't know who this is.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't know who this is.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't know who this is.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know who this is.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't know who this is.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know who this is.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't know who this is.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't know who this is.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't know who this is.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,520
I won't hold on to your under

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,520
I never thought of you the guy in fear

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,360
Me, the guy in fear

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:19,640
With lover to the ashes

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,640
I don't know all the eyes

36
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,640
I don't know the eyes

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,640
I don't know the eyes

38
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,640
I don't know the eyes

39
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,640
I don't know the eyes

40
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
I don't know the eyes

41
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
I don't know the eyes

42
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,640
I don't know the eyes

43
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
I don't know the eyes

44
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,640
I don't know the eyes

45
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,640
I don't know the eyes

46
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
I don't know the eyes

47
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
I don't know the eyes

48
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,640
I don't know the eyes

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
But about the past, about the head

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,640
But maybe the light comes shining down on me

51
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Just shining out of you

52
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,640
Just shining out of you

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,640
I'm not of you to make near us know

54
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,640
A roar of all the knowledge comes in the earth

55
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,640
A roar of all the things in the earth

56
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,640
And my life, I run so far away

57
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,640
I just run, I run all my life

58
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Couldn't get away

59
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,640
I run so far away

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Couldn't get away

61
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,640
Couldn't get away

62
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Couldn't get away

63
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Couldn't get away

64
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,640
We've got a hand touch your face

65
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
And there's only this and there

66
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,640
And from my the earth

67
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,640
And there's come my the earth

68
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,640
We've got a hand to try again

69
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,640
I'm holding it in a theme of life with the earth

70
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,640
We know life with the earth

71
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,640
And I run, I run so far away

72
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,640
I run so far away

73
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,640
I just run, I run all my life

74
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:55,640
And I run, I run so far away

75
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,640
I just run, I run all my life

76
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,640
You know that song is 25 years old?

77
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Yeah, I believe it

78
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,640
Block off sea goals, I run

79
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Picking off today is Charlie for obvious reasons

80
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:23,640
If you follow in the news at all about the UK service men and woman

81
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Being held in Iran

82
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,640
But of course they meant I ran, I ran so far away

83
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,640
And why is it that for some reason I think

84
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Steve Case from AOL was in flock of sea goals

85
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,640
I know it's just maybe it's fatigue

86
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Hey everybody, how you doing coming to you from a very crisp northern California from the Curry condo

87
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,640
It is now just about 11 o'clock Monday night

88
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,640
So Tuesday everywhere else in the world more or less

89
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
And Thursday I think in Australia

90
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Welcome everyone down under the tower of death

91
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,640
As I looked, I'm sorry

92
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Don't have anything quite, quite adjusted the way I wanted to be

93
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Hold on let me just, there we go

94
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,640
We reset some of the levels here

95
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,640
Sounds like we're breaking up

96
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,640
The tower of death to my left here that would be for you listeners to your right

97
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,640
It seems like another eight stories have been added since one was that last year

98
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Two weeks ago it's unbelievable

99
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,640
One rink and hill tower of extravaganza

100
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,640
And they're still at it 11 p.m.

101
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Still working on it, never stops

102
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Never never ceases

103
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Ah, so had a pretty uneventful flight on virgin upper class

104
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,640
As per usual

105
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Actually slept about five hours of the ten in transit

106
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
I was pretty tired

107
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Had to get up right in early this morning

108
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
And of course, I was busy late last night

109
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,640
In the attic with the lady Patricia

110
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,640
And then I had my serious sad light stuff to do

111
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
And I had just all kinds of stuff

112
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Production work, you know

113
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,640
So I was tired, went to bed late

114
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,640
It was funny though on the way to the airport in the car

115
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,640
I had radio well the driver had put on the radio

116
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,640
I said put on radio four so I could just listen to people talking

117
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,640
And apparently when we see I have a new story about it here

118
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,640
I put it in my Google notebook

119
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Here we go

120
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
I want to read a verbatim

121
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
I don't want to get it wrong

122
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
I was unbelievable

123
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,640
It was like I was in the virgin car service

124
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
On my way for a virgin flight

125
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
And on the BBC

126
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,640
Comes a report that an airline pilot has been arrested

127
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,640
On suspicion of being above the alcohol limit

128
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,640
On board a plane due to flight to New York

129
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Ah

130
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
He was a virgin Atlantic pilot

131
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Okay, okay, that may be feel really good there

132
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Anyway, so a good flight as I expected

133
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
And I did have one meeting today

134
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
At four on the afternoon at the office

135
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
So is in the condo around three went to the office

136
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,640
I'll tell you more about the meeting that I had and why I had it

137
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,640
And of course I'm pretty tired as you can imagine

138
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Even though I'd asleep a couple hours

139
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
And I want to go to bed desperately

140
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
And I didn't have a lot of things to say

141
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Because you know what I'm going to tell you

142
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
I've been on an airplane for 10 hours

143
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Luckily you guys have come through with all kinds of wacky shit you've sent me

144
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Hey Adam, how's it going?

145
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
This is uh

146
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Well, I'm not going to tell you who this is

147
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Oh, yeah, no, no, no, no, here I-

148
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
This is a Charlie listener

149
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
That's right, I'm a DSE listener

150
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
I'm actually a podcaster

151
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,640
But I'm not going to disclose my name or my podcast

152
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Only because I know you've been talking about how you would

153
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
I'd rather would listen to

154
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,640
Listeners rather than podcasters

155
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,640
Even though I got to tell you I've just reached episode

156
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Number 20 in my own episode

157
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,640
And I was so excited that I wasn't going to give you a call to let you know

158
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
That thanks to you

159
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,640
I did my 20th episode

160
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Yes, I saved thanks to you because I started to listen to you for a set

161
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,640
For a while now, a couple of years, maybe a year, a couple of months

162
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,640
And when I first started listening to you, you were promoting

163
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Hey, if you got something to say, you should do your own podcast

164
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
And guess what I did

165
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,640
And now that seems like

166
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,640
You've not taken

167
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Uh, liking too much for other podcasts

168
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,640
But anyways, I still continue to be a

169
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Listener

170
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,640
So anyways, I just wanted to chime in

171
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
Say hello, hey, you know what?

172
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
I want to contribute on a regular basis

173
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
So I'll probably be sending you some more of these

174
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,640
MP3 files so that you can play on your show

175
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,640
But for now, I will just go back to recording my show

176
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,640
For my one listener

177
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Me

178
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Yeah, I guess I'm just practicing social masturbation

179
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Yes

180
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
All right

181
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640

Awesome

Congratulations Scott, that's very cool, dude

203
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
I mean, it's like, it's almost like

204
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
We knew it was gonna happen

205
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,640
And what did he, he was, let me see what the numbers are

206
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,640
Top the charts, Amazon's number one in sci-fi horror

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,640
And genre fiction lists

208
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640

And sister held the number set number seven spot

210
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640

Number seven, I'm fucking believable

212
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Following only Harry Potter

213
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,640
And the deadly hallows in fiction

214
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
That's fantastic

215
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Oh man, so cool

216
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
Let me just see what else

217
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
I've got, I've got all kinds of, all kinds of stuff

218
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,640
This is a really nice one that I read just before I left

219
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
This morning

220
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
From Thomas Hoffman

221
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Hey Adam, just want to thank you

222
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Thank you for saving my sanity

223
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm an American expat teaching in China

224
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,640
In a city that has virtually no English-speaking community

225
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Except for college students who dabble in the language

226
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Oh

227
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
What city is it, man?

228
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,640
I discovered the DSC when I loaded up my iPod

229
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,640
For the ridiculously long international flight to get here

230
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
I love your style

231
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
You save me from the watered down

232
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,640
Politically correct English TV station here in China

233
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,640
Yes, there's only one English TV station for the entire country

234
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Dude

235
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
No satellite, can't you get anything on satellite there?

236
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
Must must be able to

237
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
And if you got broadband

238
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
There's always juiced

239
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,640
I don't hear much about juiced anymore

240
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
I grabbed the DSC every day

241
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
Listen to it religiously to remind myself

242
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
That whitty English sounds like

243
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Your entertaining is hell

244
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
He both the great work Thomas

245
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Thanks, dude

246
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
I'd love to know more about what you're doing over there

247
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
It sounds fascinating

248
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,640
And of course, big news today

249
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Hey Adam, how are you doing

250
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,640
I'm from SLV podcast

251
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,640
Just so I would give you a good bell

252
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Because I've just seen on the on the TV

253
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,640
All of the news that I've probably seen

254
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,640
So if anybody else has probably seen this

255
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,640
But yeah, my doing a deal with Apple

256
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,640
To get rid of the DRM on some of their tracks

257
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
It's not all of their tracks

258
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
I'm telling you now, mate

259
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
The revolution

260
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
I want the revolution has stopped

261
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
Bring it on

262
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Note to self

263
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,640
When saying something prolific like

264
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
The revolution has started

265
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Note to self not to stumble over words

266
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
Yeah, this is very cool

267
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,640
I'm actually I'm not sure how much difference

268
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,640
It's going to make for EMI

269
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
I mean you'll see

270
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Mark my words

271
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
We've been yelling and screaming about DRM

272
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
And get it off

273
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
And I don't think it's going to make any difference

274
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
In their sales

275
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,640
They still only have so many artists they can promote

276
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,640
And it's much better for us

277
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,640
I love it, you know

278
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
By something I can easily put it on any device

279
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
I want that's obviously fantastic

280
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,640
And of course we're getting higher resolution

281
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
It's about time

282
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
And I really mean that

283
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
So what's it going to be

284
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,640
325 kilobit sample rate I believe

285
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,640
Of course it'll be in the AAC format

286
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Which although an open format I guess you still have to

287
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,640
Transcoded to MP3 if you really wanted to go on all devices

288
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,640
So I think most devices these days will play AACs

289
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,640
But just not the enhanced version

290
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Or maybe some of them will do the enhanced version

291
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Sorry

292
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,640
So a buck 29 is that what it is

293
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,640
For a high grade version high grade copy

294
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Or high resolution if they're calling it

295
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,640
And so the 99 sense stuff will be just crab

296
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
And it'll be low resolution

297
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Which it's always been 128 kilobit sample rate I think

298
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
So that is pretty it is

299
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,640
I mean you have no idea how much we're missing really

300
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,640
And the entire generation of kids growing up listening to

301
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,640
Inferior sound quality

302
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,640
Yeah

303
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
So we'll see what that goes

304
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
Keep my eye on for sure

305
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Oh my goodness

306
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Yes

307
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Yes it made a appearance quite a while

308
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Heat up everybody

309
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,640
For satellite repair man coming after you

310
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
For satellite repair man

311
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
What's he gonna do?

312
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,640
He'll fix your misconceptions and answer questions too

313
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Nothing in the universe

314
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
And he can't do for you

315
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
For satellite repair man

316
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,640
For satellite repair man

317
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Yeah

318
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
I want to

319
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,640
Hey Adam PW

320
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,640
And with all due respect to the originator of this expression

321
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
You

322
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,640
I apologize for being among the silent on the issue of how to solve the kitchen TV problem

323
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,640
What I would have recommended was exactly what you did

324
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
But hey you're a folder

325
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,640
It was interesting to hear you talk about the delay though

326
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,640
I have a similar situation here in my home

327
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,640
The fancy digital HD home theater setup is very close to the master bedroom

328
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,640
I just need to set some of this up

329
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Heat up is referring to the sling box that I hooked up for Patricia

330
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,640
So she can watch the television in the kitchen

331
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
On her iMac

332
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Therefore removing

333
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,640
When negating the need for the television that was next to the iMac

334
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Which of course

335
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Makes sense to only have one monitor in there

336
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,640
By the way, I tried to access my sling box

337
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,640
I guess I thought I had it all set up probably

338
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,640
I guess the NAT or whatever the firewall and the router is blocking it

339
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
So I can't watch it unfortunately

340
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Anyway, so that's what Peter was going to suggest trying the sling box as well

341
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,640
And I guess he has the story of his own

342
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,640
And the TV in the bedroom is just an analog connection

343
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:36,640
And the result is about a four second delay between the bedroom and the HD setup

344
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,640
But the real result is that whenever Ros goes to bed before me she demands

345
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,640
That I switched from my beautiful HD signal to the low Res analog version

346
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,640
Because she kids they're hearing the delayed audio coming from the other room

347
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,640
That's where she talks

348
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,640
You're going to get your ass kicked if she hears that

349
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:09,640
I know man, all wives sound like that at one point or another

350
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,320
Hey, if you had a collar on Friday that claimed not to like the Folger's coffees he sampled,

351
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:23,640
the members of the Fenton Household are coffee freaks. We grind our own beans and we make our coffee

352
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,840
strong. We love coffee. So when I ordered my free coffee sample from Folger's, I picked out the

353
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,200
Colombian blend that I figured would be the closest to my favorite style of coffee.

354
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,120
When it came in the mail, I stuck it in the cabinet so I could try it at some other time without forcing

355
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,320
Roz to try it at the same time. When I went to look for it one day, it wasn't there.

356
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,960
So later in the evening, I said to Roz, do you know what happened to that coffee sample I got in the

357
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:01,960
mail? And she says, yeah, we drank at this morning. So I guess I liked it every bit as much as my

358
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:11,240
more expensive whole beans. You mean, you went, we drank it this morning. So I may have to switch from being

359
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:19,560
a grinder to being a Folger. Sorry, I couldn't resist. Later Adam and oh, Tricia, please do more

360
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:26,840
shows. I'd get into it deeper, but you are after all the boss's wife. You'll

361
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,640
well, Pida one things for sure. She will not hear your plea. I think that's pretty clear.

362
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,680
Yeah, I got a couple of responses. I love this when when people push back on the sponsors,

363
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,560
the show, and of course, Folger has been sponsoring a large part of the network for a while.

364
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,600
I think actually their sponsorship ended. It doesn't matter because the conversation is interesting.

365
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:59,240
So I got an email saying, the guy hated the coffee. He couldn't even finish one cup, and that

366
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,400
did elicit some response. Hi, Adam. This is Tim Stanton from Stanton Coffee and Indianapolis.

367
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,640
We are coffee roasters. I'd like to comment to regard why your caller David Peterson

368
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,040
probably did not enjoy his Folger's sample of coffee. Part of the education behind it is coffee

369
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:24,280
technically goes stale after about 14 days of roasting it. So anything that is pre-grounded in a

370
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:31,560
sample pack is most likely stale. Part of the reason that he enjoys the experience of grinding,

371
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,440
releasing that aroma, probably no matter what type of coffee it whether it's a regular roaster

372
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,560
or french roast as he alluded to. He's going to have a much better experience.

373
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,920
What we have done ourselves is to educate the people in the independent coffee industry because of

374
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:56,360
the influence of corporate coffee like Starbucks and other chains. We try to help them on a daily basis

375
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:02,360
make their coffee taste better. And we'd like to say thank you, Adam, once again, for actually

376
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,760
helping us develop the independent coffee.org website. And as part of that, you know, like I said,

377
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,200
all part of you and Pods show. We have started producing podcasts. So thank you again, Adam,

378
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,520
keep up the great work. Love your show. Oh, you confused me there for a second. I was like,

379
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,760
I don't did a help out with that website. I can't remember that. But you're podcasting too. Okay,

380
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,400
and that's cool. I'll go check that out. More response to Folger. Yeah, it's Bard and Oklahoma

381
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,880
City. How's it going? Just want to say a quick thank you because yesterday I received in the mail

382
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:39,480
free of charge my Folger's gourmet selection. And Folger's hooked me up with a little package called

383
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,520
lively Colombian medium roast. So I thought I'd check it out together with you here. Hold on.

384
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:51,160
Oh, it's a sound seeing tour. Oh, this is quite nice, guys. This is this is pretty good.

385
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,800
lively Colombian medium roast. It's probably fantastic also because it has a little bit of

386
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:02,200
splendid in it. Yeah, it's great. Thanks, Adam. Thank you, Folger's. Thank you, Splenda.

387
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,280
It's a double shot. I love it. Thank you. Let me let me see one of the, uh, I think it just ended

388
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:16,520
their sponsorship. They, uh, they, they up to twice, I think. Uh, let me see. Yeah,

389
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,160
oh, here we go. A message from Matt at Pods show HQ. I appreciate all of your hard work during

390
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,760
the Folger's campaign. Just want to send a reminder. Campaign, uh, end date is 331. When you have

391
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,920
the opportunity, please send along your fun reporting for the campaign. Oh, okay. I, it doesn't matter.

392
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:40,760
I still like the coffee. And if you do, let me know. It's a really cool, you, and Splenda's

393
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:47,960
ended as well. Holy crap. Okay, Tylenol PM still sponsoring to show excellent and more to come.

394
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:56,520
You know, Sandy Shaw wrote about me. Do you remember Sandy Shaw? She's the, uh,

395
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:03,640
how are the original, um, Brit chicks from the 60s? And she had a huge hit with puppet on a string

396
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,480
and turns out she's always really controlled her entire career and just went pod safe with the

397
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,560
new version of puppet on a string. Pop, it's got a brand new string, which I think is very funny.

398
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:21,160
And so she wrote about, uh, about me playing her song on, uh, on the Charlie and, uh, about pod casting.

399
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:27,240
And, um, I guess I didn't read the entire site, but, uh, she wrote about some other things that are

400
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,240
very cool to me. I had a list of very advanced licks from the after-and-sovers of, sorry,

401
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,240
known as Rodgey. Um, I was supposed to link to the Sandy Shaw website and we're, uh,

402
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,400
asking me through the details of the biography. I'm pretty sure that you haven't spotted this,

403
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,880
or I'm sure you can mention it. It says in 2003, how has been so many past this climate attack?

404
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,240
And they bought us the first plane of Rodgey's, uh, when he allowed for Lima Lima,

405
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:02,440
Yankietta, um, they bought it to fly around the UK. And it says in 2005, uh,

406
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,760
certainly buys a second plane of Trinidad and the next part to fly around Europe.

407
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,320
Anyway, I thought you'd appreciate the show recently, like, flag noise. I was, uh, given the

408
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,400
she's a grandmother, would that make her a gill? Anyone, hold on.

409
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,560
Considering she's a grandmother, does that make her a gill? I don't, that's sick, man.

410
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,120
Nah, I put her squarely in the milk category still. Gill.

411
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,480
It is cool. They have a Trinidad. That's a serious airplane. I don't know if it's the 10 or the 20.

412
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,680
But that's like a 235 knots, a 25,000 feet. That's a, that's a nice aircraft. Wow.

413
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,560
We'll have to find out what the, um, what the call sign is and find out where she, where she keeps it.

414
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,960
I can, we can do a flying with Sandy Shaw.

415
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:57,160
Hey, it's taken, uh, I don't know about, uh, a year to get the show on the air. But finally,

416
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,120
it's going to happen. No, it, it's, it's already dropped. Uh, it's already started.

417
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,680
Our first game show.

418
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,880
You know, I was thinking, I'm pretty good at trivia. Oh, yes, as who says me?

419
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,560
I know I can book your asshole, man. Yeah, maybe if I don't take my meds.

420
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,200
You think you could take me on? I think those cold northeast winters of frozen your brain.

421
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,480
If you think it can beat me. All right, Grandpa, you're on.

422
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,520
But it's grandpa now. When I'm done with you, it'll give a whole new meaning to the term Boston

423
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,760
Massacre. Oh, yeah. There's only one way to settle this.

424
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:41,080
Bone.podshow.com. See you there, April 1st, and you better bring a hand key to life away your

425
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,720
tears. You better bring a diaper, baby. I should have saved an extra diaper.

426
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,920
Oh, yeah.

427
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,440
Bone.podshow.com. Yeah, we've been working on this show.

428
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,160
It's swear to God. It feels like a year almost. Maybe it's been half a year. At least six months.

429
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,400
And all kinds of reasons why we didn't, we didn't get it on the air. And, uh, you know, we did a number

430
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,360
of pilots and, uh, internal didn't even publish them. Uh, we're happy with some.

431
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,600
hated some others. And, uh, I think we've got, uh, we think we've got a pretty interesting formula.

432
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,200
And, uh, there are actual prizes to be won. And so the first SmackDown is between the

433
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,880
Uber podcasters, CC Chapman and P.W. Fenton. Better known as the Satellite Repairman.

434
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:36,200
Yo, Adam. Yo. Trucker Tom here. I was listening to your latest podcast and, uh, you said

435
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:43,480
something about a 24 hour a day, seven day week, uh, podshow video channel, which I think is actually

436
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:50,120
quite an excellent idea. Uh, I've got a suggestion that would go right along with it. Uh, why not

437
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:57,560
set it up so that people can chat about what's playing, uh, in the, in the, in the, in the channel,

438
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,640
what's playing, what's happening, what's happening and streaming right now in the channel.

439
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,520
I think that would be, uh, sort of an added attraction to get people to come to the website.

440
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,720
So that's my suggestion, uh, hope your family's doing great. You can find me, of course,

441
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,880
at Trucker Tom podcast.com. Catch you later. No, Trucker Tom, you're going to be a part of it, my

442
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,960
friend for sure. Yeah, sometimes, at some point last year, I came up with a very simple idea and I,

443
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,400
I wrote up a business plan and, uh, kind of a concept for something called the plus.

444
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:39,000
And the plus, uh, really was a throwback to, um, or is a throwback to my radio days and my

445
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,840
knowledge of programming a radio station and an MTV as well. My television work. What I really

446
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:52,520
wanted is I, I want to have, um, a nonstop 24 hour a day video channel. So let's just call that a

447
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:58,280
stream, which, uh, well, I mean, we're starting out really, really small, uh, just one stream, but,

448
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,720
something that I wouldn't intend to go to multiple time zone streams later on just because it

449
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:10,120
makes so much more sense because I really want to program videos. Um, and these can be music videos,

450
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,840
but there's also an entire universe of single shot hilarious, uh, awesome, amazing viral videos.

451
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:26,120
And, um, and so part of the plan was, uh, a methodology, uh, to acquire these videos. So they

452
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,960
basically, um, acquiring the rights to put them into rotation, which just about everybody wants to do

453
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,800
because they, everyone just wants to grow an audience. Um, but the hardest part really is automating

454
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:44,600
this because I know how MTV, um, used to put their signal together, if you will, they had guys

455
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,960
literally sitting 24 hours a day at something called the NOC, which was the network operations center,

456
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,680
the uplink and Babylon, New York. Of course, we know what an NOC is today, but it has a different

457
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,760
type of meaning. And they would literally play one clip after another and then insert the promos,

458
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:07,560
the, um, you know, all the wacky little animations, um, top of the hours, the commercials, the

459
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:14,520
VJ segments, all on a schedule. And, uh, that's one part that's hard, but imagine actually programming

460
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,840
that. See, with most television, it's like, okay, so we're going to have it's our prime time

461
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:26,040
hour. So from 8 to 830, we'll have, um, I don't know, CSI. Oh, that's actually from 8 to 9 and then from 9 to 930,

462
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,440
we'll have everybody loves Raymond. You know, it's not all that hard when you're dealing with

463
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,200
half hours and only a very limited amount of time that we're really counts. If you want to do 24 hours

464
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,520
a day and you want to have, see, I think, um, and some of our samples, we've done 71 elements

465
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:48,200
individual elements in one hour. Um, and this has to remain fresh. So stuff has to rotate. Well,

466
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:54,040
there, you know, there's a methodology for doing that in radio. Um, and they're software,

467
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,320
but there was really no one has ever put all those pieces together for television and specifically

468
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:05,080
for the web. Uh, so we've been doing that. And Vincent is team of, uh, been putting together

469
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,320
the technology. That's why that was the meeting I had today at four o'clock to see this thing. It was

470
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:17,080
absolutely amazing where, you know, we just a couple of mouse clicks and it put together a full hour

471
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:23,080
of programming and, uh, the minute we put it together, it was streaming it out, uh, transitions,

472
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:29,960
titles, everything. It's, it's amazing. Um, I'm just, it was like, wow, this is kind of what I

473
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,520
dreamed of. It's not perfect yet. There's, you know, there's all kinds of stuff yet to be done with,

474
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:40,360
with the transitions, et cetera. Um, but I think within a couple of weeks, um, I'll take about

475
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,240
a week to fix some of the, the bugs that we identified today. So let's call that two weeks then.

476
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,520
Yeah, maybe two, three weeks and we'll have it up and running. Oh, man. It's going to be so incredibly

477
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:59,080
exciting. Let's see what we have 29 minutes. Uh, I got a little more juice left in me.

478
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,080
You know, I mean, SOS, Sultan of the Savans.

479
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:20,040
Programmer here again from San Francisco. Well, thank you for playing me comment on DSC 573 on

480
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:27,800
Puber Friday. Had some thoughts on the SMS controversy on the DSC at the moment. Oh, yes. Oh,

481
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:33,080
yes, prolific programmer. Those words are flowing out and it's controversy. Thank you very much.

482
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:41,640
It varies by provider. How much is charged when you receive or send? And I had a provider called

483
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:48,520
SOSCOM before. And they depend on pre-paid or when you're in contract.

484
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:57,560
My, um, this WISCOM service I had was called not-tell easy pre-paid. It was a pre-paid service.

485
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,280
Wait a minute, man. I got to write all this down. You give me so much information, prolific

486
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,840
programmer. I'm still trying to figure out that you were all you sent me at the other day.

487
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,440
Uh, that just really should be a recurring thing. I lied for a worldwide roaming. No call. No

488
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:19,320
cost receiving either calls or text messages. Um, it was great. Unfortunately, it was this continued

489
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,880
a few years ago. Since then, I've been getting local sims wherever I go and because for the

490
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:33,560
reasons you've stated, I know I couldn't really have a Spanish sim, a UK sim. Hey, uh, what

491
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:39,160
is talking about is a sim card. Um, and yeah, but that's not really the solution. I want people to

492
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:46,040
just have one number to reach me on. Uh, and, and, and you just can't do it. There is no global

493
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,520
global plan that is just within any reason. You know, if, if you're not paying for your incoming

494
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:57,720
calls and your text messages, then you're paying, uh, it was a pound per gig, no per megabyte of

495
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,920
data transfers. It's just ripped off. I mean, I don't know. I'm sure it's in settlement somewhere.

496
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,000
You know, if I'm using vote of phone in the UK, they're probably ripping off singular here in the

497
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:16,040
US. I mean, it just gets passed along to me. Uh, Argentine sim, wherever I go, I get them because I

498
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,960
ain't saying touch because as you noted, the call calling calling from a broad and receiving calls

499
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:29,960
abroad is very expensive. There is a solution I, I sort of discovered by accident. I have a service

500
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,880
called bonded at home, and you can essentially take your modem, you see, voice over IP service.

501
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,720
You can take your modem along with you when you travel. And thereby, you can receive calls from

502
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:48,920
people, say, if someone's a call you, Patricia or Christina, they can call you on a UK number

503
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:56,280
and get you wherever you are. That's all kids. Yeah, I know that. You know what? Actually,

504
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,200
I set the girls up with Jaja. I've talked about them before, I think.

505
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,680
J, A, H, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J,

506
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:14,840
except they pronounce a Jaja, but at home, we say, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, and they have a very

507
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,840
interesting system where on a web page, which, of course, is convenient, as you know, the lady

508
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,720
Patricia has her eye mac and the kitchen and little phone book, it's all all our calls or

509
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,080
all our favorite numbers are all filled out. And she just clicks on whoever she wants to call

510
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:38,760
and then either her mobile or cell phone or the, the home phone will ring, it will display the

511
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,440
number that she's calling. So the caller ID is actually passed through, you pick up and then it says

512
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:56,840
one moment, Jaja is connecting you. Excuse me, I don't know. And then you hear it ringing and then the

513
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:04,440
other party sees your number up here, the caller ID works there as well. They pick up, you connect

514
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:11,960
and you're paying virtually the same rates as Skype or Gizmo or any of these other.

515
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,680
In fact, they sometimes can even get a better rate because I guess they have some kind of

516
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,480
switching technotechnology and they can get the cheapest minutes for you and it works. I mean,

517
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,440
I load this thing up for Patricia, Patricia calls her mom and her sister every single day.

518
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,200
Many, many times a day. And I think our phone bill when we first moved to the UK was

519
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:39,800
easily 900 pounds in a month. And that's when I got really interested in voice over IP, believe

520
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:46,680
me. That's just, that's just obscene. That's 1800 bucks. And now it's like I loaded up 50 bucks.

521
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,960
I don't hear, I don't hear anything from them for two, three months. It's just amazing.

522
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:58,440
Hello, I was TJ for a user. I had to just stop listening and call. I was listening to a

523
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,200
horrific program, but shouting out is URL. We should make them an item for a very fixed program

524
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:11,880
or a scripting web pages. Anyway, I didn't know if you saw the comments on your blog post,

525
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,760
but even I got myself an NH under thanks to you. So we do definitely get yourself a no-check on

526
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,080
All right, that's it. I'm a traffic on Brussels, so just going to be sure very good. We can't

527
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:31,880
cheers, bye. No, man. I don't need a contract for everything. I just like their shit.

528
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,280
That's for sure. Hey, let me see. Oh, man, did I forget to load that one up? No, I didn't

529
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:45,560
luckily. Well, let's have a word with the nylon spread and the news with the smile on where

530
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:52,920
the wrong old right window for light. Let's listen world around to the nylon. Hey Adam, it's the

531
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:59,960
New Yorker in London for nylon. Wow, the 15 soldiers. Let me first say, you know, I, I wish

532
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,440
their families, all my prayers. And I hope we get these guys and lady back. I think the US should

533
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,640
be blockcating Iranian ports disrupting the oil supply. Of course, that was shooted up to $100

534
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:18,120
a barrel and they're come to the bio diesel industry. So I am not condoning this at all, but there

535
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:23,880
is one question that I think has the BS, which I think is being asked in the US, not here. Why

536
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,080
didn't those guys defend themselves? Now, before someone jumps in me, that quote is from Lieutenant

537
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:34,200
Commander Horner, who is the executive officer of the USS Underwood, which is the American

538
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:41,960
frigate that works at the HNS Cornwall. Why did the Cornwall command to send two boats out

539
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,600
with no backup in highly contestant waters? But if they did get in trouble, there was no way to

540
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:57,560
support them. Why didn't they provoke a hold off? Stand off waiting for American air planes to arrive,

541
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,280
surround them, create some sort of standoff but stop them from being taken hostage. So I think

542
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,360
the loser engagement has to be questioned. I think the Commander on the Cornwall really has

543
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:13,080
to answer as to why he sent two boats out, people lightly on and ribs, rapid inflatable boats,

544
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:18,440
and no backup possible is something that go pear-shaped as they say here. Nothing about 15

545
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:25,800
sailors, but I think the US implies, you know, the macho thing, that they would not have been taking

546
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,600
hostage. But I think there is a question to be asked about was there no way to

547
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,880
at least a Volca standoff and why they were sent to board about with no possibility of being

548
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,080
backed up. Finally, I'll let you know. I'm a closet scruncher with folder tendencies.

549
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,120
Cheers. Yeah, it doesn't surprise me. The nylon ladies and gentlemen,

550
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:53,800
as part of our stable of savants, nylon, I'm a little disappointed by your take on all this.

551
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,600
First of all, I believe I think I heard a snippet of news somewhere that

552
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,840
was there an apology, which is really what Iran is asking for it? I'm disappointed in nylon,

553
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:10,680
is that you didn't cite the history between the UK and Iran, or actually it's a Persia,

554
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:19,880
because the brits have been in that region since 1902 or 1903, I think in 1908,

555
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,840
and they've been displacing governments and shas and putting people in place because of BP,

556
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:34,040
of course, British petroleum, which may at one point have even been British Persian petroleum.

557
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,920
I can't quite remember where the name came from. Maybe it was always just British petroleum,

558
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:44,280
but they had a Persian partner and then at one point the government wanted, or the shy,

559
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,040
I think wanted to nationalize all of it, all of Iran's oil, and then whoops, he was gone,

560
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:56,760
then all of a sudden his son was put in his place. So there's definitely been a bad

561
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:03,480
vibe between the United Kingdom, or Britain, I should say, and Iran. So this shit has been going on

562
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,960
for a long time, and it's like, what were they doing? Well, we all know what they were doing.

563
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,360
You know, they're spying, checking stuff out, showing that they're there, of course.

564
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:25,560
So, uh, wouldn't mind hearing your thoughts on that there, uh, nylon.

565
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,400
Alright, I gotta go to bed, so I'm gonna play one more song for you. I can't remember who recommended

566
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,280
this to me, but I do like it. Cocony, and it's, uh, well, where are we?

567
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,560
There we go. Get your light up.

568
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:57,000
It's overrated, scholarship, you've earned it. That's the way, yeah, that's the way.

569
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,840
What is when you got it and gone and made it? You're for a certain amount of troubles and

570
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:10,840
stay in the deal for that you try to send it. That's the way, yeah, that's the way, yeah.

571
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:17,480
What is going on in the right way? You're for a certain amount of troubles and stay in the

572
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:24,440
deal for that you try to send it. That's the way, yeah, that's the way.

573
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:32,120
You're for a certain amount of troubles and stay in the deal for that you try to send it.

574
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:51,800
I also ignore, yeah, whether I, I'll smash it and you break it. That's the way, that's the way.

575
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,280
What is going on in the right way? You're for a certain amount of troubles and stay in the

576
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,280
deal for that you try to send it. You're for a certain amount of troubles and stay in the deal for that you try to send it.

577
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:13,240
You're for a certain amount of troubles and stay in the deal for that you try to send it. That's the way, yeah, that's the way.

578
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:20,840
What is going on in the right way? You're for a certain amount of troubles and stay in the deal for that you try to send it.

579
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:39,000
What is going on in the right way? You're for a certain amount of troubles and stay in the deal for that you try to send it.

580
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:49,000
What is going on in the right way? You're for a certain amount of troubles and stay in the deal for that you try to send it.

581
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:59,000
What is going on in the right way? You're for a certain amount of troubles and stay in the deal for that you try to send it.

582
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:15,000
What is going on in the right way? You're for a certain amount of troubles and stay in the deal for that you try to send it.

583
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:23,000
What is going on in the right way? You're for a certain amount of troubles and stay in the deal for that you try to send it.

584
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
If you're a geek, you'll appreciate this.

585
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I recommend that to me. I went into my Google notebook where I keep all of my show prep for the show.

586
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Just entered Kokoni and it popped up with an entry and a link to an email which of course is in Gmail. Open it up and there it is from Aaron Cooper.

587
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Subject not your official musicologist. Dude, here's the deal from the United Kingdom with influence, such as any Lennox to rhythmic Cindy Lauper.

588
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Lannos Morris, Seth Savage, Garden, Chili Pepper, Seal, Bonnie, Rate, Chris Isaac, Sarah McLaughlin, Tracy Chapman, Amy Grant, Foren on Blons, Peggy Lee and Nancy Sinatra.

589
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
How about about about about about about about? He actually recommended it for a football Friday.

590
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Interesting. I kind of like that one. Kokoni gets your light up.

591
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Wrap it up daily source code for today.

592
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So as always, it's dailysourcecode.com, Adam at podshow.com, and it'll be an interesting week.

593
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm going to be here all week. I'll be here all week, everybody.

594
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And I believe Monday and Tuesday and Los Angeles. So I hope you stick around for the ride. Take care.
