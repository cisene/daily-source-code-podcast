1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Do you really need Mobile One Extended Performance Mode Royal?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,880
Take this simple test.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,880
It's time to buy a grill.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,400
Do you get A, a nice little charcoal number, or B, 100,000 BTU stainless steel unit with

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,760
an infrared sear burner?

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,760
Okay, that's it.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,760
If you answer B, that means you don't settle for a second best.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,160
And you deserve Mobile One Extended Performance, a fully synthetic mode royal with 15,000

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,240
miles worth of guaranteed protection.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,000
That's five times longer than traditional oil change animals.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,440
When it comes to engine protection, don't settle for anything less than Mobile One Extended

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,120
Performance.

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,360
Delta Sierra Charlie, 662.

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,520
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, and the next generation radio

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,760
content in my ears.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,280
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,960
I'm just taking this out of Korea.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:02,360
And now, a message from the President of the United States, George W. Bush.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,720
I have adopted the sophisticated terrorist checkfix, and I'm a dangerous dangerous man with

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,320
dangerous dangerous weapons.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,040
I want to bring the coal resources in America and force the critical out.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,040
I have a weapon or mass destruction.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,040
I'm a brutal dictator.

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
Now I'm the evil.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
I have a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for

28
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,040
What's wrong with you?

29
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,040
What's wrong with you?

30
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,040
What's wrong with you?

31
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,040
What's wrong with you?

32
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
What's wrong with you?

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
What's wrong with you?

34
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
What's wrong with you?

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
What's wrong with you?

36
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
What's wrong with you?

37
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
What's wrong with you?

38
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
What's wrong with you?

39
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
What's wrong with you?

40
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,040
What's wrong with you?

41
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,040
What's wrong with you?

42
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
What's wrong with you?

43
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
What's wrong with you?

44
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
What's wrong with you?

45
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
What's wrong with you?

46
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
What's wrong with you?

47
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
What's wrong with you?

48
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
What's wrong with you?

49
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
What's wrong with you?

50
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
What's wrong with you?

51
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
What's wrong with you?

52
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,040
So you're hungry?

53
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,040
You're avoiding it because of my dependence onрудrum

54
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
I will ignore it because of money

55
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
We will sell something less and Dick黨

56
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Dick..

57
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,040
We will sell something less than those withdrawals

58
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Let's go!

59
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Let's go!

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040

Let's go!

00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Let's go!

71
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Let's go!

72
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Let's go!

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Let's go!

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Let's go!

75
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
Let's go!

76
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Let's go!

77
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Let's go!

78
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
Let's go!

79
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Let's go!

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Let's go!

81
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Let's go!

82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Let's go!

83
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Let's go!

84
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
Let's go!

85
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Let's go!

86
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Let's go!

87
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Let's go!

88
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Let's go!

89
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Let's go!

90
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Let's go!

91
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Let's go!

92
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Let's go!

93
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,040
Let's go!

94
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Let's go!

95
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Let's go!

96
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Let's go!

97
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Let's go!

98
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Let's go!

99
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Let's go!

100
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Let's go!

101
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Let's!

102
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,360
Oh, wow, I really missed you guys.

103
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,880
How am I peeps doing?

104
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,920
It's kind of an interesting day.

105
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,440
Well, so I'm gonna turn off some of that noise there.

106
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,360
Interesting day in the United States.

107
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,160
We all know why in the world, I would have to say

108
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
on the six anniversary of a horrible tragedy

109
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,560
that happened in New York City.

110
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,480
I gotta tell you, my eyes have been very open.

111
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,680
And there's been so many videos.

112
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,080
And I have to admit that I've watched

113
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,320
just about every single 9-11 video

114
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,680
and people talking about all different kinds of aspects

115
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,800
and conspiracy theories, which has almost started

116
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,920
to receive a negative connotation,

117
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,440
which it really shouldn't.

118
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,280
And my mind is just swimming around

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,600
with all kinds of thoughts, particularly how I,

120
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,880
now that I know and the world knows how inept

121
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,520
the central intelligence agency really is,

122
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,840
I'm not thinking at all that it's improved.

123
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,800
A lot of the documents that have been

124
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,000
that are published in this book

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,200
or have been declassified in 2003, 2005,

126
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
30, 40 years worth of documents.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,760
And it's all crap, but they just suck.

128
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,280
And there, anyway, besides that,

129
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm seeing a movement, and I think the movement

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
is loosely called 911 or 911 was an inside job.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,200
I'm seeing people show up in public places

132
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,520
where there's television cameras.

133
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,240
I hear people talking about it.

134
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,760
And I received an email from my good buddy,

135
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,600
a lot of second, we just got a email here.

136
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,800
Here it is.

137
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,360
The official biographer of all things curry media,

138
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,640
Tom Scuding, a clog walk down, down under.

139
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,080
And he sent me a link to two links, actually.

140
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,520
One, which was very interesting.

141
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,520
And yes, I will remember to put these links in the show

142
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,640
notes at dailysourcecode.com, that very similar

143
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,840
to previous to 2001, there were a huge amount of put options

144
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,520
out there in the market, particularly on airlines.

145
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,480
I think Americany United at the time.

146
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,080
And someone or somebody's or some entities

147
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,960
made out like bandits because of put options basically

148
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,400
gamble against a stock or against the market or against anything.

149
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,800
I guess you could really make a put option.

150
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,120
So according to this link at theinteldagely.com,

151
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,520
I will just grab that for you.

152
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,120
By the way, for today, I plan, I'm just going to talk a little

153
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
bit of shit, then you guys are going to talk a little bit

154
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,440
because there's plenty of cool comments that came in.

155
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,600
Here we go.

156
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,040
A huge downside purchase of put options

157
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,280
by an unknown investor or conglomerate in Europe

158
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,560
has both investors and NWO, not quite sure what that stands for.

159
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,720
NWO watches a buzz worldwide.

160
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,600
Someone has placed a $4.5 billion bet

161
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,560
that within 30 days, the European stock market

162
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,040
will take at least a 33% nose dive.

163
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,080
Such an event would be 10 to the market crash of 1929.

164
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,640
So there are 60, and this I presume is traceable

165
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,760
on is just fact.

166
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,560
I'm just going to have to take it at face value here.

167
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,600
There are 65,000 pending contracts at $750 in this,

168
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,880
oh, it's betting against the standard and poor index.

169
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,880
This controls six and a half million shares.

170
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,680
So with the put option, you basically,

171
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,280
you wind up paying a fraction of what you could make.

172
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,280
But of course, you stand to lose your entire investment.

173
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,880
The six point five million shares at $750

174
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,480
or $4.875 billion.

175
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,640
The entity or individual offering these sales

176
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,360
can make money only if the market drops 30 to 50%

177
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,520
within 30 days.

178
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,920
If the market does not drop, the entity or individual

179
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,960
involves stands to lose about $1 billion

180
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,800
just for engaging in these contracts.

181
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,280
And I know that's a be true.

182
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,120
On the other hand, if the prediction is correct,

183
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,200
the reward could be over $2 billion.

184
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,640
So does it have a date on this?

185
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,160
I think it's before.

186
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,520
Maybe it says it here.

187
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,560
Anyway, you got to read this article.

188
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,160
But that would be valid.

189
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,080
Here we go.

190
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
All right, doesn't say it.

191
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,800
Shit, I thought I read that somewhere.

192
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,040
Maybe it's in the,

193
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,520
that's how one was supposed to the seventh of September.

194
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,080
So anyway, so a cataclysmic or catastrophic event

195
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,120
could clearly cause that.

196
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,480
Of course, this doesn't have to happen in Europe

197
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,960
to make it because this bet was placed in Europe.

198
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,400
The standards in poor could pretty much affect,

199
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,960
will affect markets worldwide.

200
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,840
So that was the first link.

201
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,680
And I did check that out.

202
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,960
And then he sent me a link to another video,

203
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,880
which is a two hour long video.

204
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,440
I watched the whole thing because, of course,

205
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,480
look, Tom is a damn well trusted source for me.

206
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,280
Now let me just get this.

207
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,880
It's from 911Blogger.com.

208
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,880
It's a video by a guy named Richard Gage.

209
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,400
And he is an architect.

210
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,640
And he goes through two hours of methodical

211
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,040
dissection of the collapse of World Trade Center tower

212
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,160
seven and one and two.

213
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,440
And I would have to say, has presented,

214
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,400
because he doesn't present a conspiracy theory,

215
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,720
he presents architectural evidence

216
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,440
that this was a controlled demolition.

217
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,880
And of course, he backs that up with,

218
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,160
and it's great because it's power point, basically.

219
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,200
But he has all kinds of video and things from new sources

220
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,760
and what people were saying.

221
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,760
And it's very, very convincing that these towers were brought down

222
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,640
at least by controlled demolition.

223
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,480
And not by aircraft or jet fuel.

224
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,480
I'll just say there's one thing that he doesn't mention.

225
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,880
He goes through all the temperatures

226
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,280
and what jet fuel burns out, et cetera.

227
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,000
And the steel, what kind of temperatures

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,880
the steel needs to melt and all kinds of inconsistencies

229
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,280
and reports, particularly by FEMA.

230
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,680
Now, there's a surprise.

231
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,080
I don't know, I think FEMA are the black box guys.

232
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,120
That's probably what they suck so bad at Katrina.

233
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,560
It help in people because they're too busy

234
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,720
being the new CIA.

235
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,640
Maybe, I don't know.

236
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,640
And I just want to remind you,

237
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,200
because he doesn't mention this, this Richard Gage dude

238
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,520
that jet fuel, it sounds really explosive

239
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,880
and really massive, right?

240
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,040
But it's diesel, basically.

241
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,560
It has the same very similar properties to diesel oil.

242
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,840
And I'll tell you how I know that

243
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,040
because I have actually, this is some while ago,

244
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,840
I have had an occasion where we had a choice

245
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,200
to make in the helicopter.

246
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
And this was in the turbine helicopter,

247
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,800
so jet engine, the choice was land

248
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,160
and have someone come out with a truck to help us refuel.

249
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,840
Or we could keep trying to make the airport

250
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,320
and risk severe consequences.

251
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,160
Or we could land near a regular gas station

252
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,600
and fill it up with diesel oil, which we did.

253
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,840
And yeah, it smokes a little bit more than normal,

254
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,000
but it certainly did work.

255
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,320
So I just want to add that.

256
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,800
You should check this video out as well,

257
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,640
of course, I'll link in the show notes.

258
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,920
And it will give you a different perspective on things.

259
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,920
I guarantee you that you'll be thinking long and hard

260
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,720
about what's going on.

261
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,680
And I mean, can you tell?

262
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm in total red pill mode.

263
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,760
It's really a big time red pill.

264
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Thanks, by the way, to Vadim Saliva,

265
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,640
who sent me the artwork for today's show.

266
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,160
It's like an old school 1910 version of podcasting.

267
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,560
Very cool, Vadim, I appreciate it.

268
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,480
So you'll only see that if you play the show on an iPod

269
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,280
or some kind of program application

270
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,480
or device that can see the album art,

271
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,800
but I think you could kick out of it, it was very, very cool.

272
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,200
Let me say, so Friday, no wait.

273
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,520
Friday, we spoke on Friday, right?

274
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,320
No, Saturday I spent all day preparing my presentation

275
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,920
for the IMedia Conference in San Diego,

276
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,360
which is about an hour and 10 minutes flight from here.

277
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,040
And the idea here is, and this is really,

278
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,080
this is the part of my job.

279
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,120
I hate, I really, really hate selling.

280
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,040
I just hate it.

281
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,600
I hate sucking up to people,

282
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,280
but you gotta do it.

283
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,520
Because we're just not in the position yet

284
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,720
to be fighting people off.

285
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,120
And no one is these days in media quite honestly.

286
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,240
Except Google, but that's a different type of advertising.

287
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,680
So the whole point of this IMedia Conference

288
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,120
is there's a brand there, so brands, they don't pay.

289
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,520
People who are selling pay to get in,

290
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,560
it's very, very typical model.

291
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,640
So we paid for our visitation,

292
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,840
and then of course you get to present,

293
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,360
although they said very specifically, it's funny,

294
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,840
because this is a parallel to the tech world.

295
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,240
No commercial, you're not allowed to, to pimp your company.

296
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Which I was okay with, because I actually,

297
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,440
I had a great time.

298
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
And I hope, they did videotape it.

299
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,880
I hope they're gonna put that up on the web

300
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,840
and I hope it kind of looks okay,

301
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,280
because I was having a great time.

302
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,760
And I was playing all kinds of amazing shit

303
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,040
and just freaking them out.

304
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,160
And when I was done,

305
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,880
you know, there were like representatives of big ass brands,

306
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,120
like AT&T and Nissan and Cadillac,

307
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,200
what else was there?

308
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
I don't remember.

309
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,560
They were like, I'll jump an up and say,

310
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,800
and cool, and I was playing some of your splendor comments.

311
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,320
But they were getting it, you know, they really were.

312
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,360
It's so easy, you play a splendor comment

313
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,760
where someone's talking about splendor

314
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,480
and they said, you know, when's the last time someone

315
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,440
called you up and said, hey, man, thanks for that banner.

316
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,080
I really enjoyed it.

317
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,520
That pretty much hit home.

318
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,640
So that was good, you know,

319
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,000
but it was two days of schmoozing.

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,840
Yeah, stay overnight.

321
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,560
Nice hotel, I'll have to say, bandwidth sucked completely.

322
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,840
So, you know, even thinking of doing a show

323
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,080
was out of the question,

324
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,800
I missed the MTV Awards, right?

325
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,240
And you know, I saw just like the tail end of it.

326
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,840
Of course, it's very clear how that went.

327
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,920
I guess I did get an increase in the rating.

328
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,400
So that's good for him.

329
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
But, you know, the whole Britney Spears thing

330
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,280
is like, you know, come on.

331
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,600
That's, it's just below MTV standards, I feel.

332
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,800
The way they set that up and the way they did it,

333
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,720
it just didn't really feel right.

334
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,720
But then again, you know, it's about money.

335
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,120
Most of the media businesses.

336
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,840
And, you know, when they started doing remote control,

337
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,400
that's when the ratings went from 0.3 average.

338
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,480
And, you know, 0.4 was kind of 0.5 rating point.

339
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Was a big deal.

340
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Went to 1.0 and 1.2.

341
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
And that was the end of it.

342
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,840
And from there on out, it was just long-form content.

343
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,640
So, more people are watching it.

344
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,440
It's just alienated the core group

345
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,920
and the core demographic.

346
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
But on the other hand, you know,

347
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,280
you can get your videos from anywhere these days.

348
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,640
Anywhere, so where's the business, you know?

349
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,920
But it does, I do feel ripped off.

350
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,640
Like I completely understand people who were upset about that.

351
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Oh, dude, by the way, if you don't watch Kat's cast,

352
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,720
which is kat, c-a-s-c-a-s-t Kat's cast.podshow.com,

353
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,120
you should definitely check out the most recent episode.

354
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,840
Now, I know Kat, you know who does this show.

355
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,120
But you've got to see it.

356
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,720
It's, I think it's episode 19.

357
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,680
She's in the South of France, all by herself.

358
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm not gonna tell you the whole story.

359
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,880
All by herself.

360
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,080
And she's sitting at a pool with like long blonde hair flowing.

361
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,960
She's got some kind of negligee nighty thing going on there.

362
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,160
You know, the big dark glasses.

363
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,480
And oh, man, it's like, I'm gonna watch a porno.

364
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
It's really a lot.

365
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,840
And then she goes into this story,

366
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,360
which is just unbelievable.

367
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,120
About what happened to her in the South of France.

368
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,840
Now, you gotta know, this beautiful woman alone,

369
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,200
by herself, the South of France, known for topless beaches.

370
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,400
And yeah, she got a pretty bad experience.

371
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,680
So I suggest you check it out.

372
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,680
I'll put that episode into the DSC channel

373
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,040
for those of you following along with that.

374
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,240
I wish I had some time to update the DS.

375
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,640
I wish I had time to do lots of stuff.

376
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
Man, it's killing me.

377
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,360
It's so busy and check this out.

378
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,160
So I thought it was gonna be here

379
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,240
to the end of the week.

380
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,560
Ron and I are actually gonna fly the red eye tomorrow, Wednesday night.

381
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,360
We're gonna take the red eye to New York for one meeting.

382
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,240
It's an important one.

383
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,320
And then we're gonna fly back for more meetings on Friday,

384
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,160
back to San Francisco.

385
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,160
And then on Saturday, I go back again to London.

386
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,160
I hope I wanna go home.

387
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,760
I wanna be in my girls.

388
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,760
I really do, we're still grieving for Christ's sake.

389
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,360
We had him, it's the Doctoroe here.

390
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,200
She's got so much dirty, full of clothes to catch up on.

391
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,400
I've got like two months, I was an outfall fan at home.

392
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,680
And then I was like, I've got cable.

393
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,160
So I'm just catching up now.

394
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,800
Let's just listen to the last couple of dirty, full of clothes.

395
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,080
And I just want to say, I'm so sorry to hear about your sister's cat.

396
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,320
But rest assured she is in the same of cat heaven

397
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,440
that we're still through what they say.

398
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,200
And it's endless happiness fly.

399
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,120
Anyway, I can't wait to catch up on the rest.

400
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,240
And I just wanted to make a request from

401
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,240
mashuptown.com, which I absolutely love and it's taken me

402
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,320
to see it work while I'm trying that I head around

403
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,840
a whole bunch of new stuff.

404
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,600
But if you can play a razor head ceremony,

405
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
I think it will look great.

406
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,640
That is brilliant.

407
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,880
Anyway, speaking.

408
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,720
All right, baby.

409
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,240
I love it with Dr. O'Calls.

410
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,440
And she's got a hot voice.

411
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,640
Yeah, I look for that one.

412
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,120
I looked for a razor fish, whatever you call,

413
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,240
or whatever it was.

414
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,120
And so I wound up, I found that what I opened with Tom Tom

415
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,680
Rio Grande, Rio Grande mashup.

416
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,400
I found that on seekpod.com, which is an awesome sight.

417
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,120
If you're looking for illegal MP3s,

418
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Sierra Echo, Echo, Quebec, Papa Oscar Delta.com.

419
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,000
So you can search for their Tom, oh, two, two Tom.

420
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,520
Sorry, T-O-T-O-M, two Tom.

421
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,200
And the song is apparently called Rio Grande mashup.

422
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,720
So I couldn't find that Dr. O, but I know that Dr. Art

423
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,520
heard your request.

424
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,040
And I'm sure he'll work on that for me over there at mashuptown.com.

425
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Yeah, thanks for the, I know you're a big,

426
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,680
you're a big pussy person.

427
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,760
Oh, man, I gotta tell you, I gotta tell you

428
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,240
about the new pussy musical.

429
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,480
I won't do it yet.

430
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,880
I gotta get approval to talk about it.

431
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,000
Anyway, thank you so much.

432
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,720
And I worked through phase one, I think of part two.

433
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,040
I mean, first of all, it's like when you get a new bike

434
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,120
or you know, something you really wanted

435
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,640
and throughout the day you'll think, oh, what was that?

436
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,840
Oh, yeah, something in my stomach, I feel something,

437
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,040
oh yeah, that's right, I'm really excited.

438
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,600
I got a new gadget, you know, like gadget porn.

439
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,920
It's exactly the opposite.

440
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,960
You'll be walking around and I'll say,

441
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,760
what was, oh, oh, I feel really bad

442
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,800
because my pussy cat's gone.

443
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Anyway, the girls went out and they went to the catch shelter.

444
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,880
I think they have, and I think we have new family members.

445
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,920
I'm not gonna talk about it just yet.

446
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,920
So I wanna make sure, I gotta get the full load down.

447
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,440
I think we have some new family members.

448
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,840
And by the way, in the UK, they don't mess around

449
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,080
with that stuff, excuse me, no sponsor today.

450
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,120
And they don't mess around with it.

451
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,800
So when comes your house to, to, you know,

452
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,880
to scope you out and make sure everything's okay and kosher.

453
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,320
They won't give you a cat before that.

454
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,160
It's like a whole program, which I think is really good,

455
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,600
but I'm sure it's really hard to get homes for cats.

456
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,640
And of course, just to love that you guys are sending in

457
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,560
has really been helpful, particularly when you get

458
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,520
the homeboys calling in.

459
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,440
Adam, it's Chuck from Jersey.

460
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,120
It's just hard about your cats, Cindy,

461
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,560
and very sorry to hear that.

462
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,400
My family and I have a dog that we adopted.

463
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,800
I think it's been nine years ago now.

464
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,000
Since then, he's gone blind and we've had two children

465
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,560
who are now five and two and he's been great.

466
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,160
And we still refer to him as our first kid.

467
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,880
And we had a little scare, a little while,

468
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,920
I've got six months ago and he turned that okay.

469
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,560
But yeah, I mean, pets are part of your family.

470
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,880
And we love them dearly and they love us back unconditionally.

471
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,720
And I'm really sorry for your family right now.

472
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,640
And some people may laugh at the whole idea

473
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,480
of being sad about pets passing,

474
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,480
but they're part of your life and they're irreplaceable.

475
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,080
So again, I'm sorry and hope you guys get over this soon.

476
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,920
Take care.

477
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,160
Man, Chuck, appreciate it, dude.

478
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,600
Hey, women, if you want a real man, go look in Jersey.

479
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,760
That's where all the real men are.

480
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,680
We're tough, we're rough, but we know how to show our emotions.

481
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,640
And I was thinking, you know, we're spinning up a show,

482
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,120
called Spirit and Messenger with us.

483
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,520
Guy called Gordon Smith in the UK.

484
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,200
And he's the real deal.

485
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,000
He really does talk to the dead.

486
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,440
And now I've had a couple of meetings with him

487
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,720
and I've never asked him anything.

488
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,680
But he has told me on numerous occasions

489
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,840
that to help people really ease into believing him.

490
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,840
He can communicate with their pets that have passed away.

491
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,160
And that usually gets people on board within seconds.

492
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,200
I'm thinking I'm going to give him a try on that.

493
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,360
But I'm going to record it.

494
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,000
I think that'll be pretty interesting experiment.

495
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,280
Okay, so as I said, I talked for about 20 minutes there.

496
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,960
So I want you guys to give me some more feedback.

497
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,040
You know, I was looking for a free to call in.

498
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,880
We've got a number in the US.

499
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,480
And we've, of course, we've got a plus four four number in the UK.

500
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,280
Hey, Adam, it's Jerry from anapolis.

501
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,280
And I just wanted to mention something.

502
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,440
You just, I don't know what the SD is.

503
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,040
But most recent one, anyway, you talked about

504
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,360
the resource being where he is.

505
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,200
And I had just recently read an article in the post.

506
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,920
I think it was Washington Post about the resource being.

507
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,760
And he's kind of been doing his own thing for a while.

508
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,120
And he actually, by training, I think,

509
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,480
is a jazz musician.

510
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,400
And he's got a new jazz out milk.

511
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,400
And he used, there was a big ride up about that.

512
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,880
And I don't recall the details.

513
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,400
But I think if I'm guessing it's probably on iTunes at this point,

514
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,560
I think that he's sort of resurfacing.

515
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,520
And I'm always not using a fantastic piano player.

516
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,840
So I'm thrilled to hear that he's actually out and about again.

517
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,520
And so I just wanted to mention that to you.

518
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,440
And you know, how people may be looking up.

519
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,960
Holder.

520
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Red pill.

521
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,760
Yeah, you know, that's a guy who should be on the podcast

522
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,200
of music network for real, you know.

523
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,880
This is very talented.

524
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,960
Had one or two really big hits in a decade ago.

525
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,360
She was a guy's got lots of great songs.

526
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,080
And I'm sure radio doesn't give the fucking time a day.

527
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,320
So we should be all over that.

528
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,480
One song that is really like broken out

529
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,320
was just blowing me away is this Peter Bjorn and John

530
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,680
with young folks.

531
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,640
I know you've heard this song.

532
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,080
It's all over the place.

533
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,640
And of course, in a region that on the podcast music network

534
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,080
is five, I'm concerned that's where I was exposed to it.

535
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:23,480
If I took you friends that did before, told you I used to be,

536
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:30,720
would you go along with someone like me?

537
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:37,720
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

538
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:44,000
Would you go along with someone like me?

539
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,480
Had it before and had my share, it didn't lead me away.

540
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,080
I would go along with someone like you.

541
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

542
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:11,080
Would you go along with someone like me?

543
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:18,080
Had it before and had my share, it didn't lead me away.

544
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:25,080
I would go along with someone like me.

545
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Had it before and had my share, it didn't lead me away.

546
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,080
I would go along with someone like me.

547
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:53,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

548
00:27:53,080 --> 00:28:00,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

549
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

550
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:14,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

551
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:21,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

552
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:27,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

553
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

554
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

555
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

556
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

557
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

558
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

559
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

560
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:08,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

561
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

562
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,080
If you knew my story were forward, had a lot of my history.

563
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,080
All right, I've got to figure it out.

564
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,080
I just went through the pot-saved music network.

565
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,080
This is the label Wichita, these guys are awesome.

566
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:37,080
Let's see, they've got to, where they put up on the network so far, let me see.

567
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:43,080
Block party, the cribs, Simeon Mobile Disco, Esper's, the Bronx, the drips,

568
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:49,080
Kempestinos, euros, child, Saul Williams, Peter Bjorn and John, which had just heard

569
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:56,040
her space, holiday, blood brothers and clap your hands, say, yeah, awesome, it's, uh, I think

570
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,520
yeah, UK label. So what I'd like, you know, now that this is like a hit, I'm hearing

571
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,320
the song everywhere, it's huge. I can't get away from it. I'd like the Poncec music network

572
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,040
to take credit for that. I really would not pod show the pod safe music network and all the

573
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,640
pod casters that have played this song and producers using it, integrating into their

574
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:23,320
productions, um, which it's odd dudes. If you're listening or uh, Peter or Bjorn or John, you know,

575
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,520
call in, man. Let's, uh, let's do this. I mean, I'll, I'll, I'll get the publishers I'll pay for that.

576
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,240
It'll, uh, we, you know, we can totally get the mainstream media to go, oh, well, it's quite amazing

577
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,960
you know, the store, all the internet, not a really bad bad bad bad. But really, that would be

578
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,960
good for us, trust me, I'd like to do that. Hi, Adam. This is Janice from New York and I'm

579
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:52,680
calling with two comments. Um, first comment, you mentioned in DSC 660 that it might be a good idea

580
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:58,200
to have a comment channel on Podger Plus. And I've been meaning to ask you about that since, uh,

581
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,000
about a month ago when I had what I thought was a brilliant idea, which works. Uh, I've been

582
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,400
listening. That was, of course, the brilliant idea was like, I think I need to send Adam

583
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:13,320
naked pictures. DSC since before the phone line. And so I kind of had it my mind for a long time to be

584
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:19,960
able to send you a comment in MP3 format without having to attach it to an email. I've recently discovered

585
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,960
audacity, a free program, easy to download and easy to use. Oh, girl, are you reading? Are you reading

586
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:32,920
your comment? For recording MP3s. And I tried to use it to record a comment, um, which

587
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,800
in here, I'll explain, when you announce the cheddar would enable people to put any type of

588
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:44,360
file into a channel. I thought I could use the cheddar to paste an MP3 format message. Oh,

589
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,480
I got to tell you something. We have something so incredibly cool.

590
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,240
Oh, crap. I don't want to tell you. If I did, I'm not going to tell you because someone

591
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,040
else is going to fucking do it before we're ready. I don't think what we've ready before

592
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,840
November or December. So, uh, not exactly for that application, but yes, something, uh,

593
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:06,040
something cool. And then email you the link to the channel. Um, but I wasn't able to actually

594
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,320
paste the MP3 file. I'm not sure why. Maybe it was just my incompetence. No, no, no, no, no, no,

595
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,400
you've got exactly the right idea honey. You've got exactly the right idea stick with it.

596
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,640
Well, I've had it in my mind to ask you whether that's a feasible way to get you DSC comments.

597
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,520
So, those of us who are not pod gestures, but would like to be able to leave you a pre-recorded

598
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:29,560
comment. I know you like the spontaneity of the phone line. But let me just tell you one thing that

599
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:36,440
we're doing. Um, I've seen it working internally. Um, you'll be able to, uh, to leave a comment

600
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:42,520
for each individual show, uh, just by using your built-in microphone or your webcam or whatever you

601
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,920
want. You actually, you can do video, too. So, it's not like this is some incredibly new

602
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,760
fangled thing. Uh, excuse me. No sponsor. This book was purely air. Not paid for.

603
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,880
Um, yeah. So, that's common. So, that will make it a lot easier. Some of us might, you know,

604
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,280
ordinary listeners might want to actually pre-record a comment and we would leave it to you

605
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,960
that way. Anyway, quickly, my, my second comment. Uh, here's a suggestion. Um, for the next time

606
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,240
you feel down in the dumps about the DSA. Create a folder on your computer and save the messages

607
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,360
you've been receiving since DSA 654 about how much your show means to us your listeners.

608
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,840
Um, you know, at least the most meaningful comments. I'm a high school teacher and I keep a

609
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:32,440
file of notes. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, wait a minute. Yeah, I'm saving this one. That's for sure.

610
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,640
High school teacher. Oh, tell me you have long hair that you wear up in a bun.

611
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,280
And you pull out the bun and just shake it off for you, baby.

612
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,280
To set me over the years about how much they've enjoyed my class and what it's meant to them.

613
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,560
Every once in a while, I need to consult that file to cheer me up and remind me why I do what I do.

614
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:57,000
So, um, anyway, just a suggestion, maybe you do that already. Um, and, um, in that, uh,

615
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,280
in that vein, um, I wanted to mention that most listeners appreciate the showing us that we always

616
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,200
forgive you when you miss a day or two or three. In fact, before those days are helpful,

617
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,840
we'll only get behind and want to catch up. Um, I'm a listener that listens to every single

618
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,320
episode. And I don't know what that says about me, but every once in a while, when I wonder why I

619
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,920
listen to every episode, you'll play just a great song that I'll just love or say something that

620
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:26,440
makes you laugh out loud. Um, and that reminds me why. So, anyway, I want to also mention that many

621
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,400
of your jingles have become the soundtrack to our, um, whenever I hear the Friday jingles,

622
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,080
and that also makes me laugh out loud. That's nice. Thanks so much, Adam. Uh, take care.

623
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,200
No, no, no. Thank you. Hold on. I just, I got to get your name again. Hold on.

624
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:45,400
Yeah. Hi, Adam. This is Janice from New York. Janice, of course. Oh, Janice.

625
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:52,200
This is why I do it. This is exactly why I do it. It's for that. Thank you so much.

626
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,400
Yeah, now I'm a happy guy. I was just telling my, my buddy, cut you, actually. So, I'm pretty happy

627
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,800
guy. You know, I got people who, uh, who think highly of me. I've got high friends in low places.

628
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:10,440
Hey, Adam, this is Dave. I may not look like Elvis. I may not talk like Elvis.

629
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,080
And I may not sing like Elvis. I sound exactly like Elvis. This is eating a peanut butter

630
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:24,920
Nana sandwich. Later. Rock on. Yeah, rock on. We're still looking for a younger sounding Elvis.

631
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,720
Actually, you know, just keep calling in you guys. And you know, we're, we're getting somewhere.

632
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,520
We got a lot of people with, uh, with some talent out there. It's cool.

633
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,520
Hey, Adam, this is Eric, compartment. I just call it about, uh,

634
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,000
Madeline McCain. Uh, yeah. I first heard about the little girls of

635
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,880
Duccia on your show. And in fact, I had her picture in my album art on the show.

636
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,720
Uh, that's one of the reasons I would like listening to you is the, the international

637
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:55,160
content that I get that I don't get elsewhere. And it preceded it being on meteor networks

638
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:02,280
and television by a good week and a half. But now, now I see that, uh, there's a hundred

639
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:09,000
recent DNA match of little Maddie's DNA and the rental car used by the parents. So, uh,

640
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:17,320
it just reminds me of, uh, John Bony or ANSI and, uh, other sad things. But, um, you got the word

641
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,720
out fast and early and then that, that could help. And it could have been a, uh, deciding

642
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,720
factor. And I just want to thank you for, uh, bringing it out. And, uh, now that we,

643
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,960
no different things are going on, we can recognize that as well. Thanks, Adam. You're doing a great job.

644
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,720
All right. All right. Thank you. Well, it's interesting because, uh, for many weeks now,

645
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,040
I've had information that came from, uh, now I've built up a pretty interesting network of, uh,

646
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,240
of peeps in, uh, in London, particularly through super agent Keith, who I still have to get on

647
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,520
this show, uh, he'll drive you nuts. Um, if you won't be able to understand him,

648
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,080
please, not if you're, unless you're British. And, uh, so through this network, I've, uh,

649
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,680
come to learn many things, but the allegations were so severe about, uh, what happened that I,

650
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,520
I really just didn't feel comfortable talking about it because, you know, I've had people talk

651
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,760
shit about me that wasn't true and it could be very hurtful and certainly wasn't on this level.

652
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,800
But here is the story that I have understood, uh, and you should Google this story,

653
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:24,120
Madeline McCain. So, uh, briefly, two parents, they're both doctors. I think good general practitioners.

654
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,480
And, uh, they're in Portugal and they're in a hotel hotel until they've got twins and Madeline.

655
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:38,360
Uh, and I guess Madeline is the eldest. And she was what like, uh, I've got how old, four, five, six,

656
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,440
five, something like that. And, uh, so they're having dinner nearby, like, you know, like,

657
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,920
like 30 second distance, not too far. And they go back, this is the story, and they go back

658
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:55,080
once the wall and they check on her. And they come back and, uh, she's gone. And, uh, so they can't find her.

659
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:03,640
And this is now been what? A couple months, something like that. So this has been a huge,

660
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,200
huge story. And, you know, particularly when they, you know, they look at the next door neighbor.

661
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:15,480
And there's no clues. There's nothing. Um, and now there's DNA evidence that was found in the rental

662
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,320
car that they drove, uh, that they rented 25 days after Madeline went missing because they've actually

663
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,240
stayed in Portugal. What's been interesting about this is they went to the press. They, you know,

664
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:30,120
they visited with the pope. You know, there's, uh, a David Beckham has started a fund for trying to

665
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:36,360
find Madeline, you know, huge, huge, huge publicity machine. And I have, you know, and,

666
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:41,160
that's okay. So please don't take this the wrong way. Um, but you look at them and, you know,

667
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,000
and she's kind of hot. And you, and that, and that did strike me right off the bat. So what I heard

668
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,360
is that they're swingers. And this has been a rumor on the internet for a while, but this is the

669
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:57,640
way I heard it before I even went looking for a story that they're swingers. And what they do is

670
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,800
when they go swinging, they basically, and they're, remember their doctors, the GPs, since, you know,

671
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,160
this is something that can't get out and they really really has to be quiet. So they're, first

672
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:13,000
they do it in Portugal, I presume. And that they drug their kids. You know, give them some kind of

673
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,760
sleeping shit so that they go to sleep. And apparently something went wrong and a little girl died.

674
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,720
And so there's this cover up. That's what I heard. And, you know, then all of a sudden I hear that

675
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,720
she's being listed as a suspect. And it's a DNA evidence. I'm like, Holy crap. I mean, like,

676
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,800
holy, holy crap. So it's, uh, it's pretty naughty stuff. Speaking of crap.

677
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:46,600
I had an, it's off of Zion from the, uh, pissidnow.com. Uh, I didn't, I hadn't, I just running through a lot

678
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,960
of the old podcast because I'm still playing catch up. And I came across the, uh, you're coming

679
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,280
about being toilet trains. Now, you're on halfway there. The next bit you need to be changed

680
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,560
on the subverted toilet training. Basically, uh, the first part has already been trained to,

681
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,760
as you said, um, uh, is even the toilet seat down. But you don't want to make it too easy for

682
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,160
the, uh, the lazy female from our species. Uh, what you want to do is put the toilet,

683
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:19,320
lid down as well. You can say, I'm still following your orders. The toilet seat is down.

684
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,680
Well, it stops them from backing up like a truck. I'm just going to tell you what,

685
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:28,600
just pointing down. Um, uh, truck. That's your, uh, he's returning from the subverted. Um,

686
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,480
uh, people are rolling. See you later. All right, I'm, and actually, I, I think I even talked

687
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,840
about that. I, I started doing that. Like, yeah, you know, if you want the toilet seat down,

688
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,280
if you want me sitting on the toilet, that's fine. But you're doing some work, too. And I

689
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,600
have said, look, here's the general rule. Everyone closes the lid. And if you close the lid,

690
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,840
of course, the seat is closed. So that's the rule. Everyone leaves with the lid down. And I do

691
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:55,480
it even here. I'm all of myself. There's no one watching me. Or are you?

692
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,440
I mean, this is my buddy from New York. And I've been meeting to play a song of his and I saw

693
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,840
that lots of people have been playing the song in the past week or so. So right now,

694
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:15,000
it feels like the waves are crashing. And the cold winds roar. You've been tossed and

695
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:25,240
think you've lost your way. You know I've been there, but there's a lighthouse flashing

696
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:33,480
on that distance shore. And when the going gets rough, if you look hard enough,

697
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:43,640
it's still shining to show us the way. And if you look for that light,

698
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:51,560
when you're lost in the darkness of night, you'll find that that's when the slightest

699
00:41:51,560 --> 00:42:01,960
star shines brightest. Look straight ahead, then hold on tight and you'll sail safe and warm

700
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:11,480
through the middle of a mighty storm. You'll get through it all right, and you don't lose sight of the dream.

701
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:28,600
Right now, I know what you're thinking. You're wondering how you'll make it through another day.

702
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:39,880
We've all been there. It kind of feels like you're sinking. And there's no way out,

703
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:48,920
but when you're strength nearly gone, keep on keeping on. And just know that you'll get their one day.

704
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:59,960
Cause if you look for that light, when you're lost in the darkness of night,

705
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:07,400
you'll know that that's when the slightest star shines brightest. Look straight ahead,

706
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:16,520
then hold on tight and you'll sail safe and warm through the middle of this mighty storm.

707
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,000
You'll get through it all right, and you don't lose sight of the dream.

708
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:34,280
Like your heart's desire be your guide at all. It's a wild exciting ride

709
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:46,760
straight through the middle to the other side. And there we look for that light.

710
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:56,680
When we're lost in the darkness of night, you'll know that that's when the slightest star shines brightest.

711
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:07,640
Move straight ahead, and hold on tight and you'll sail safe and warm through the middle of this mighty storm.

712
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,280
We'll get through it all right, if we don't lose sight of the dream.

713
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:24,280
We'll get through it all right, if you don't lose sight of the dream.

714
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:43,480
We'll get through it all right, if you don't lose sight of the dream.

715
00:44:43,560 --> 00:45:04,040
I thought it was just perfect for September 11th, 2007. Couldn't go to more New Yorker kind of guy

716
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:11,800
to do it too. David Epilito, that guitar man from Central Park, you can find him at iLoveTheCompany.

717
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:18,680
IOTC.podshow.com, I think it's that guitar man.com is another one of his addresses, and please,

718
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:25,080
you can of course a link in the show notes to the song on the podcast music. Now where you can buy it from the

719
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:30,040
podcast music now work, and then all of the proceeds go to David. I'm sure you can get it on iTunes,

720
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:36,680
and please, you know, do that or listen to his show. It's one of the, the few music shows I listened to,

721
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:43,400
very, very regularly. He does a lot of them, but there's always something cool, and always it's,

722
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,200
he's not quite a new jersey guy, but you know, he got that jersey emotions thing going on, which is cool.

723
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,800
And I'd really like to make him some money, so he needs more listeners, and so either buy a song or

724
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:00,280
listen to his show or do both, okay? All righty, so I have no idea when we will speak to each other next.

725
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,000
I just don't know what's, what's going to happen because of all the travel.

726
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,440
I'm going to try and work in something somewhere. I promise you. So I hope you enjoyed the past 45

727
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,240
minutes. I surely enjoy you guys being along for the ride whenever you can, and I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
