1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Delta Shira Charlie 5-9 or 7.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,440
Adam Curry was just a guy with big hair who sold his first company and thought he'd

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,720
just kick back and take it easy, but he never counted on this.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,680
Adam and Patricia, the king and queen of the matter, or just the lady and the tramp.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,120
On the daily source code.

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:06,520
This street has come true to grant your invites and gentlemen, and let the family show begin.

7
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:16,520
It's Adam and Patricia, yes Adam and Patricia, Adam and the lady Patricia.

8
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:24,000
Shira, that's pretty, you're a pretty little thing that comes on on the street, not pulling it away.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,640
It's easy, but I don't know about a thing, so need a thing until you won't lie.

10
00:01:31,640 --> 00:02:01,640
It's easy, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don

11
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:10,140
Don't know about it, but I don'tæ–ƒ it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, but I don't know about it, it contains a context in the literature, alright?

12
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,420
Yeah, I heard about it, yeah, alright.

13
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,160
Right.

14
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:17,780
Me?

15
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,100
Right.

16
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,200
No fun.

17
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,080
Yeah.

18
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,680
I'm out of thing, it's only nothing, until you won't lie

19
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
You're safe if I'm the winner

20
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
And expose me to your allergies

21
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,080
You get under my skin like a splinter

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,080
And you've gotten a sneeze and at the tree

23
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,080
And if I tried to leave you, you'd hit me with hatred

24
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,080
You think what's up, girl, I'm your worst nightmare

25
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,080
The mixture, you're such a lucky girl, please don't want no more

26
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Me though, you're my control, I'm not getting on that train

27
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,080
But we were the distant, I was through the night, you're hey, hey

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Everything is fine, I am your sugar, I'm free, you're a pretty woman

29
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,080
But I'm out of the street, I'm totally the right

30
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
And you're safe if I'm the winner

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,080
But I'm out of thing, it's only nothing, until you won't lie

32
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
You're safe if I'm the winner

33
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,080
And you're safe if I'm the winner

34
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,080
And you're safe if I'm the winner

35
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,080
You love it, you're a hey, hey

36
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Everything is fine, I am your sugar, I'm free, you're a pretty woman

37
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,080
But I'm out of the street, I'm totally the right

38
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
And you're safe if I'm the winner

39
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
And you're safe if I'm the winner

40
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
And you're safe if I'm the winner

41
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
And you're safe if I'm the winner

42
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,080
And you're free, you're a pretty woman

43
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,080
But I'm out of the street, I'm totally the right

44
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:27,080
And you're safe if I'm the winner

45
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:37,080
And you're safe if I'm the winner

46
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,080
And you're safe if I'm the winner

47
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
But I'm out of the street, I'm completely beat

48
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Addable red, sugar and spring.

49
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Could have been one of your bands.

50
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
I was thinking about it.

51
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,080
I know. I did this.

52
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Yeah, and they're done that.

53
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,080
That goes way back.

54
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,080
We already did this in the 70s, huh?

55
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

56
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

57
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
wearing the good girls go to heaven,

58
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
bad girls go to London T-shirt.

59
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Yes.

60
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
It is the Lady Patricia everybody.

61
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Fresh back from her incredible journey.

62
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Incredible journey and showbiz extravaganza

63
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
in the in the in the in the pay bar.

64
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
The low countries.

65
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Yes.

66
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Baby, it's good to have you back on the show.

67
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Everyone's been emailing me and leaving comments

68
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,080
and they love what you did and they love you on the show

69
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,080
and they fucking hate me.

70
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
They hate me, but they do like,

71
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,080
No, they like to very much.

72
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
No, I'm talking about people listening to the show.

73
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Oh, okay.

74
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
You know, that's everyone else except you.

75
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Well, you cannot satisfy everybody.

76
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,080
But you do, you do satisfy me.

77
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
It is Wednesday.

78
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
I have a sound in my ear.

79
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
You have no idea.

80
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
You don't like sound like a bunny.

81
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
No, you sound great.

82
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Well, not in my ears, but it's okay.

83
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
Because seriously.

84
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,080
That's a disc, this jockey remark.

85
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
And I always hate that when they do that.

86
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
You know, talking about the sound actually.

87
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
But you see how easy it is to talk about that.

88
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,080
It's not you sound fantastic.

89
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Okay.

90
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
As long as you think I sound fantastic.

91
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
You sound wonderful, baby.

92
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Hey, how was your week?

93
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
Do anything fun?

94
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Why, it's a trip.

95
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Do anything exciting?

96
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Every day, I ran around from here to there.

97
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,080
And I did all the promotion I could do.

98
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,080
And lots of interviews and I did all the show programs.

99
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,080
So what else can I do?

100
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
I don't know.

101
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
I expect lots of people to be cars.

102
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
There is not much I have to say in Holland.

103
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
There's not much to do.

104
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Well, there is no, there are no, say, pop programs.

105
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
You know, like, top of the pops.

106
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Yeah, but that's it.

107
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
But you're not a show.

108
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
It shows you can do music.

109
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,080
Well, you did the only one that was relevant.

110
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
You did the dancing with the storm.

111
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,080
That's why I did it.

112
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,080
Because this is a great show to do a real good show this thing.

113
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
So I did.

114
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
And I have to say, I think I said it yesterday.

115
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,080
People have no idea how much work goes into setting something up like that.

116
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
I mean, it's.

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Do you know how hard I mean?

118
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,080
People do not realize how hard it is to get 23 marines to dance to a different song.

119
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
And they do it.

120
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
No, no, no, no.

121
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,080
I mean, there are all, it wasn't that I'm purpose.

122
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
You wanted them to look out at the time.

123
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,080
Well, out of rhythm.

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
No, but we didn't have the time.

125
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Because that takes an hour.

126
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Yeah.

127
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
And you only have an hour to rush.

128
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
Yeah.

129
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
Yeah.

130
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,080
And another hour or two hours to get them feel the rhythm.

131
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,080
You know, they're not used to doing that.

132
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
And these are not Americans.

133
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
Americans have this.

134
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
You know, it's in them.

135
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
The rhythm is in them.

136
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,080
They're hardly any Americans that cannot swing.

137
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,080
You know, that is the way they clap and everything is always on the two and the four.

138
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
It's right.

139
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
And most certainly Dutch audiences.

140
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
But I've seen the bridge do it as well.

141
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
They all clap on the one and the three.

142
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
Yeah.

143
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
Is there a way to explain how wrong that is?

144
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,080
I mean, I don't think people even understand what we're talking about.

145
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
It's about a feeling.

146
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,080
And whatever they feel, and if they're happy and enjoying it, it's all clear.

147
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
But it is.

148
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Now, of course, you are our musical sabond here on the.

149
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
On the Charlie.

150
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Yeah.

151
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
I mean, I would like to.

152
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Can is a way you can explain why clapping on the.

153
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,080
How do you even find the one and the three instead of the two and the four?

154
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
And what's it? Why do you have to?

155
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
It's a feeling.

156
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
But why do you have to do it on the two and the four?

157
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Is the one and the three wrong?

158
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
So.

159
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
No, to pass.

160
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
And if it's a march.

161
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Can you give an example?

162
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
It's a march.

163
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
If it's a march.

164
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
If it's a march.

165
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
If it's a march.

166
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
You can do it.

167
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Okay.

168
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Okay.

169
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
Which one is?

170
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Ta-da-da-da.

171
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Da-da-da.

172
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
Ta-da-da.

173
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
You've been now you're doing that every beat.

174
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Yeah.

175
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Well, that's a march.

176
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Yeah.

177
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,080
And actually, there's hardly any song that you have to do it on the one and the three.

178
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
But what is that?

179
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Can you just explain it?

180
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Two.

181
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
A.

182
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Two.

183
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
The one.

184
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Two.

185
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Four.

186
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
One.

187
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
One.

188
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
One.

189
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Two.

190
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
One.

191
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
One.

192
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Two.

193
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Then four of all?

194
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
I look like an idiot.

195
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Yes.

196
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Benish people can do it.

197
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
You know, Chuck attack attack attack attack attack attack attack attack.

198
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
But that's a different story.

199
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
I don't know.

200
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
I don't know.

201
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
As long as they have fun, it music is about fun.

202
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,080
And if you do it on the one and the three, it's a...

203
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Just not in our show.

204
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
But it's sex with sex.

205
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,080
I have to say people who swing do it better.

206
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,080
And of course, the most important question of the day then.

207
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Am I married to an American yet?

208
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
Yeah.

209
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
We got the rhythm baby.

210
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
We know how to do it.

211
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
It's a rhythm.

212
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
It is an American thing.

213
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
It's a good thing.

214
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Do Americans make better lovers than other...

215
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Well, I haven't had that much experience.

216
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Well.

217
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Because I only had one America.

218
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Thank you.

219
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
I was waiting for that.

220
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
So the trick question.

221
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,080
And like, let me see what she said.

222
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,080
I had an English man in American and most of them Dutch.

223
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Not that many.

224
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
And...

225
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
I don't know.

226
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
I don't know.

227
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
My numbers are low.

228
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
It depends on if they are in music business.

229
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
It's much better.

230
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Really?

231
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Really?

232
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Yeah.

233
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Yeah.

234
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Oh, oh.

235
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
So everyone wants to know.

236
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
You know, like the after party after the show.

237
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,080
You were like hanging out with all the lesbian girls and hugging.

238
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Yeah.

239
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
And what was all that about?

240
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
This was purely for my benefit.

241
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Because I love them all.

242
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
Uh-huh.

243
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
I love them all.

244
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
Mm-hmm.

245
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
You know that I was so hot.

246
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
That was so hot.

247
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
That was so easy to say.

248
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
I love people.

249
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
I don't mind.

250
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
I'm telling you.

251
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,080
It's a boy girl.

252
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
It was so hot.

253
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
So hot.

254
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
I know.

255
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Thank you.

256
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Thank you so much.

257
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Thank you.

258
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
Thank you.

259
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
Thank you.

260
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Thank you.

261
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Thank you.

262
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Thank you.

263
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Thank you.

264
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
Thank you.

265
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Thank you.

266
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Thank you.

267
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Comic strip.

268
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Comic strip.

269
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Comic strip.

270
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Comic strip.

271
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Comic strip.

272
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Comic strip.

273
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Comic strip.

274
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Comic strip.

275
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Comic strip.

276
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Comic strip.

277
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Comic strip.

278
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,080
You know that I met comic strip blogger last week in London.

279
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
We had our first face-to-face meeting.

280
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
And he has something to say about the Netherlands as well.

281
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
So I just wanted to pop in his comment for today.

282
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Okay.

283
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Hello.

284
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
I'm Kerry.

285
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Hello.

286
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
It is me.

287
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
The CSB.

288
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,080
You're a servant in areas of mobile phones and European Union.

289
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,080
So it was fun to have a little chat with you in person.

290
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,080
In touch office in London.

291
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,080
And your employee Lydia was one.

292
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Foxy lady.

293
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Did you do her any time?

294
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Oh, man.

295
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
I hope Lydia hears this.

296
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
That's funny.

297
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
All in all.

298
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,080
You are not that tall as I thought you will be.

299
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,080
That indeed you are blonde.

300
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Not so dark blonde as myself.

301
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,080
But contrary to common opinions about blondes.

302
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,080
You are much more competent.

303
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Then I fought initially.

304
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,080
And you are competent in various areas.

305
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080
I am surprised.

306
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
Yes.

307
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,080
So investors and potential ink truly can trust you.

308
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,080
You are one fucking competent entrepreneur.

309
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:33,080
By the way, I would like to mention that Netherlands has just opened its labor market

310
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:40,080
since May the first 2007 to work as from East EU.

311
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,080
And now Dutch no longer are races.

312
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Thank you.

313
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Oh, that happened.

314
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,080
How did he look?

315
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,080
You know, I have to say I was expecting.

316
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Was he good looking?

317
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
He didn't know.

318
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
He was pretty good looking guy.

319
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
If he lost 20 pounds.

320
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
He showed me a driver's license.

321
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,080
Does the people are a little bit heavy on good looking?

322
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
No.

323
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Especially man can be very attractive.

324
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,080
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

325
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
The comics are good looking guy.

326
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
I'm attracted to him.

327
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
I'm not saying that.

328
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
No, just checking.

329
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
No, I mean, just in general.

330
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
Yeah, no.

331
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,080
He was a, you know what?

332
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
This is a really smart guy.

333
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
He's a little brazen.

334
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Yeah.

335
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
He speaks a little breathlessly.

336
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
How old is it?

337
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
I think I asked him that.

338
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
I think he's 37.

339
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Oh, no.

340
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
41.

341
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
41.

342
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
I don't know.

343
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
He's very mature.

344
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,080
He's been around for a while.

345
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Yeah.

346
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
For sure.

347
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
Funny.

348
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
So I had a really good time dear.

349
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
I did a good time hanging out with you.

350
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
Yes.

351
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
It was great being your group.

352
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Yes.

353
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
This time it was all about me.

354
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
Yeah.

355
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,080
I'm following you and entertaining everybody around you.

356
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Did I provide a appropriate services?

357
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
Absolutely did.

358
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,080
And wonderful thing is about you that you are never ever jealous.

359
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Oh, no.

360
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
This is very hard.

361
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,080
You can kiss as many lesbians as you want.

362
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
I mean, there are also a lot of men.

363
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
And you know that we are very touchy.

364
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,080
You know, show business people over.

365
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,080
Touchy touchy and I know a lot of people.

366
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Hold on.

367
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Can I just define it?

368
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
What can I touchy?

369
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
What?

370
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Since we're very touchy.

371
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
What can I touchy?

372
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
What can I touchy?

373
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
You can touchy everything.

374
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,080
Yeah.

375
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
No.

376
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
You know what I mean?

377
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Yeah.

378
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
You're a bit glowy.

379
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Yeah.

380
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Yeah.

381
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
I agree.

382
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
You know, and for people.

383
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,080
Well, listen, when you work, when you work, it's a bit like,

384
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
but when you're working on a project and you're working in very,

385
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
it's almost like flying.

386
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Now, I don't go around hugging guys that I fly with.

387
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
But you feel so close.

388
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Yeah, of course you do.

389
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,080
And especially making a good show, working together, trying to,

390
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,080
you know, everybody does his best to make it in just one.

391
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,080
It needs to be how many seconds it was four minutes, four minutes.

392
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Not even, man.

393
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
It was like three and a half for something like that.

394
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
Yeah.

395
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,080
So it needs to be so tight and so good.

396
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,080
And everybody was working so hard to do this.

397
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Yeah.

398
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,080
I had some very, very talented people around me.

399
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,080
That was, I was very thankful for that.

400
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,080
They were all hanged and picked by me.

401
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Yes.

402
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
And selected.

403
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
It was hand-selected.

404
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Yeah.

405
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
But they all delivered, so.

406
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,080
So the, for me, the exciting news is that your remix is now on the podcast,

407
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
I'm using that work.

408
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,080
I heard.

409
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
We put that up last night.

410
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Yep.

411
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
Thanks to Willie the Kay and Red Bull at production.

412
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,580
Yeah.

413
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,580
They cleared all of that for us.

414
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Yeah.

415
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
I saw it was played.

416
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,580
It was already played this morning on some German show.

417
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
Oh, really?

418
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,580
Dude.

419
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,580
Are you kidding me?

420
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
It's fun.

421
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,580
We had a lot of fun years and years ago in German.

422
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,580
Hope you don't mind it.

423
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,580
I hope you don't mind it.

424
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,580
I don't play it on this show because I've played it like four times of

425
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,580
people going to get sick of me.

426
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,580
It's sick of me.

427
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,580
It's sick of me.

428
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,580
It's nauseating.

429
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
Yeah.

430
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,580
Right.

431
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,580
They can go back.

432
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,580
But you know, just, I want to say that,

433
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,580
don't fuck out of like, they're a very good job.

434
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,580
Now, this is the guy who was your manager for 20 years.

435
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
Yeah.

436
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,580
And producer.

437
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,580
And he is, he did a good job making it really, really.

438
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,580
It has a very happy feel.

439
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,580
Very good beat in it.

440
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
Yeah.

441
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,580
And Julie, the choreographer.

442
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,580
She really puts some cool stuff together.

443
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,580
Great dancers.

444
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,580
Yeah.

445
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,580
My home is partner.

446
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,580
Ramco.

447
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,580
Your own dance part.

448
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,580
Drive it.

449
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,580
Dancer.

450
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,580
I'm your proud Dancer.

451
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,580
Dancer for money.

452
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,580
While we keep him, we keep him in the show.

453
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,580
He's good.

454
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,580
He's very good.

455
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,580
Yeah.

456
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,580
So, now it was the dance on television.

457
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,580
It was announced in the newspaper.

458
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,580
It was announced on that incredibly popular show.

459
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,580
The daily source code.

460
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,580
Yeah.

461
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,580
That you're going to Afghanistan.

462
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,580
Yeah.

463
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,580
How about that?

464
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,580
What exactly do we even know what's happening here?

465
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,580
Do you have the exact details?

466
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,580
I have to make a phone call when I'm done with the show here.

467
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,580
And see exactly what I can bring.

468
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,580
How many people, you know, what we can do.

469
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
Because we have to do three shows.

470
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,580
I told those guys who in the PR.

471
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,580
I said, you better get a C 130.

472
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,580
That's like the huge, that's like the biggest military plane.

473
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,580
Yeah.

474
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,580
The bay of the bus.

475
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,580
You better get a C 130.

476
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,580
Oh, dude.

477
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,580
Well, I have to go.

478
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,580
I have to go.

479
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,580
I have two cameras.

480
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,580
I have one.

481
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,580
I probably.

482
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,580
Two cameras.

483
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,580
Well, I think.

484
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,580
I don't know.

485
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
There's more people who want to maybe dunk you.

486
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,580
Documentary of it.

487
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,580
Yeah.

488
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,580
I don't know.

489
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,580
I have my own photographer's coming.

490
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,580
I was going to make a hole.

491
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,580
You know, we could do our own documentary.

492
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,580
And we could produce that.

493
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,580
That too.

494
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,580
Yeah, we could.

495
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
But I heard.

496
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,580
If.

497
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,580
He's.

498
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,580
He's.

499
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,580
He's.

500
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,580
He's like the.

501
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,580
He's like the.

502
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,580
He's like the Dutch.

503
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,580
What can we compare him to, huh?

504
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,580
Uh.

505
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
First of all, he's.

506
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,580
He's a.

507
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,580
He's a great performer.

508
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,580
Um.

509
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,580
Uh.

510
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,580
Somewhat can be.

511
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,580
If I can put it lightly.

512
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,580
Yeah.

513
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,580
Yeah.

514
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,580
He's almost like a young Cliff Richard who doesn't take himself as seriously as Cliff Richard.

515
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,580
Let's do old.

516
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,580
No, that's.

517
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
A Cliff Richard.

518
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,580
A young Cliff Richard.

519
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,580
Okay, young.

520
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,580
Who.

521
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,580
At least admitted he was gay.

522
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,580
And it will be Williams.

523
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,580
But then a little bit more old fashioned more gay.

524
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,580
More gay.

525
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,580
Much more gay.

526
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Yeah.

527
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Sort of gay.

528
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,580
Yeah.

529
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,580
Oh, isn't that right?

530
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,580
Well.

531
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,580
Why?

532
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
Quite.

533
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
He is a very good entertainer.

534
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,580
Oh, he's fantastic.

535
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,580
He's number one.

536
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,580
He's the top of the bill.

537
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,580
He's got his TV show.

538
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,580
He's got a huge concert.

539
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,580
It's not.

540
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,580
I think it would be great.

541
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,580
And he's a very nice guy.

542
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,580
So he.

543
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,580
He said I want to come and he has his own camera with him because he's doing a real

544
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,580
I've sort of documentary about himself because he's doing the arena.

545
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
Yeah, but I don't like that.

546
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,580
He's giving a whole lot of stuff.

547
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,580
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

548
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,580
I don't like that.

549
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,580
Well, there.

550
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,580
I don't know.

551
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,580
I don't want to talk about it now.

552
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,580
I'm telling you right now.

553
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
If there's going to be any video documentary shit done.

554
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
We're going to do it.

555
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,580
Then he can use our.

556
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,580
No.

557
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,580
He will give him some footage.

558
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
But we're going it.

559
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,580
I don't want it.

560
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Because he doesn't make the documentary.

561
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
Some fucking production company.

562
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,580
Well, I don't want them all.

563
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,580
Everybody was screaming.

564
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,580
Oh, can we come with the camera?

565
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,580
Can we come with the camera?

566
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,580
So we have to see how we can find the camera approvals through me.

567
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:16,580
Because I've already set it up with the, you know, with the the Ministry of Defense.

568
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,580
They have satellite.

569
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,580
Connect.

570
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,580
Uplinks.

571
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,580
We have ever since we did the stuff in Iraq now that now they really understand what kind

572
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,580
of internet pipe you really need.

573
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,580
So they have great internet pipe.

574
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,580
So we could do live stuff.

575
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
From there.

576
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,580
And by the way, one of the three camps you'd go to would be Condahar.

577
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,580
Which has, it's the international base.

578
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,580
So there's going to be Americans, Brits.

579
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,580
And you'll be performing for them as well.

580
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,580
Yeah. Well, I'm going to bring some nice guys.

581
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,580
I'm going to bring some, you know, because they're girls over there.

582
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,580
I'm going to bring beautiful beautiful dancers.

583
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,580
Yeah.

584
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,580
Yeah.

585
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,580
Yeah.

586
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
I know you saw them.

587
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,580
Didn't you?

588
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,580
God damn.

589
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,580
Some of them were really cute.

590
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,580
The blonde one.

591
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,580
Yeah.

592
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,580
She's very pretty.

593
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,580
Yeah.

594
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,580
I think, but I think John already has a group.

595
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,580
She's standing in John's tent.

596
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,580
What are you guys doing?

597
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,580
That's how we talk.

598
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,580
It's the way showbiz people talk, huh?

599
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,580
You always have to think you can get them.

600
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,580
In a snap, in a snap of a finger.

601
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
Like that.

602
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,580
Not a problem.

603
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,580
Come here, baby.

604
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,580
I'm not.

605
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,580
I'm curived.

606
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,580
You heard my show.

607
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,580
Don't pay attention to my wife.

608
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,580
No, please.

609
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,580
No.

610
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
She says it's okay.

611
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
And now we don't understand each other.

612
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,580
That way also.

613
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,580
What do you mean we don't?

614
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,580
We have it on the stand.

615
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,580
We haven't understand anything.

616
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,580
I was looking for that.

617
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,580
We have an open relationship.

618
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,580
It's okay.

619
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,580
Somebody is open.

620
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,580
Oh yeah.

621
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,580
Why open?

622
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,580
Oh, god.

623
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,580
I was a lot of fun.

624
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,580
So I look forward to hearing about Afghanistan.

625
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,580
So you have to come by more often to give us an update and let us know what's happening.

626
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,580
Because I would presume this has to happen.

627
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,580
Well, I'm going to have my first meeting this afternoon and see what they're.

628
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,580
Okay.

629
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,580
What they can handle.

630
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,580
All media, all media through one, please.

631
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,580
I'm serious about it.

632
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,580
Oh, you're good at it.

633
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,580
I know.

634
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,580
I know.

635
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,580
I know exactly.

636
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
I don't want it to suck.

637
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,580
And if Khouford, your photographer will come along.

638
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,580
I mean, he will make the most beautiful picture.

639
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,580
Just of, I mean, I know exactly what he'll do.

640
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,580
Yeah, that'll be awesome.

641
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
That would be exposition type material.

642
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,580
Okay.

643
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,580
And I did also a great photo shoot.

644
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,580
Yes, you did.

645
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,580
One of the best, be most beautiful glossy magazines.

646
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,580
In fact, it's called glossy glossy.

647
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,580
glossy.

648
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,580
We have a couple of very nice magazines.

649
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,580
But this one, I didn't, I haven't worked with.

650
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,580
With.

651
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,580
With.

652
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,580
Yeah, you know, that's because dancing this is a star.

653
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,580
You've been in Holland so long.

654
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,580
Yes, my, my accent.

655
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,580
I've worked with him.

656
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,580
Yes.

657
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
Right.

658
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,580
Right.

659
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,580
Okay.

660
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,580
So.

661
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,580
And, and that went very well.

662
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,580
When does that come out?

663
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,580
That comes out.

664
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,580
June June.

665
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,580
And then I have the second, the 22nd of May.

666
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,580
May.

667
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:08,580
I have a special on the where I talk about my living with a heart disease.

668
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,580
Living with heart disease.

669
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,580
So that's very interesting.

670
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,580
And so I'm unbelievable.

671
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,580
Everything goes like a little.

672
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,580
And the cool thing is it's just like a jigsaw.

673
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
Everything.

674
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,580
The cool thing is it's actually cost us money to do all this.

675
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,580
Yes.

676
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,580
Are you really invested?

677
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
Have you really invested in this?

678
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,580
Yes.

679
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,580
Park.

680
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,580
I think there will come some fruits of this tree.

681
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,580
No, it's not, it's not about the money.

682
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
No.

683
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
No, I mean, fruits.

684
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,580
It's, you know, it's enjoyment.

685
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,580
We're having fun.

686
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,580
That's what it's all about because it's a lot of fun.

687
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:51,580
And I remember people saying and asking Patricia should do something.

688
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,580
Here you are.

689
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,580
You're doing.

690
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,580
So if this catches on and I know you're not going to do anything small.

691
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:05,580
So I could imagine the maybe one or a series of really big concerts that you might do a full show.

692
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:11,580
Um, you realize that if you really want to do that and make it work and make it efficient for our home life and my busy schedule.

693
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,580
Yeah.

694
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,580
That I will have to fly you.

695
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,580
Oh, did you tell them about?

696
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
Are you kidding me?

697
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,580
Of course I told them about yesterday.

698
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,580
So we do that maybe after a little bit of a music right now.

699
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Do what?

700
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,580
Tell them about the flight and I took another one.

701
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,580
Well, they already know that.

702
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,580
Oh, you already told them.

703
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,580
Well, of course I did.

704
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,580
I did show yesterday.

705
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,580
Don't you remember why that's right?

706
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,580
Yeah, I need some music now.

707
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,580
What kind of music would you like?

708
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,580
Uh, uh, do you have some swing?

709
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,580
Uh, no.

710
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,580
Unless you can swing to this.

711
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,580
Oh, yeah, of course.

712
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,580
This is like you can't get more American than this.

713
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,580
Woohoo!

714
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,580
Junior, what was I thinking?

715
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,580
It's never something better wrong.

716
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,580
You feel at least so you give up a call.

717
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,580
You never thought that this could happen to you.

718
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,580
Please forgive me for the things I do.

719
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,580
Do it down into the neighbor's yard.

720
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,580
Makes an edge of mama's grinning in the car.

721
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,580
Looking for love and all the wrong places.

722
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,580
Don't know the name, but you know that faces.

723
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,580
What goes up would have come back down.

724
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,580
So you better get out of town.

725
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,580
What was I thinking?

726
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,580
What was I thinking?

727
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,580
Yeah, when I got some truck I saved my head.

728
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,580
Through a fun life, that's where it's better go.

729
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,580
Get the hammered on my way to school.

730
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,580
Walking in, thinking man, I'm old.

731
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,580
Not teach you get me as because he was a freak.

732
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,580
He said, I think you're a little bird you can't bring me sick.

733
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,580
In the morning, you will realize.

734
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,580
And on the 9th, you won't first cry.

735
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,580
I ain't drinking games naked, twisted.

736
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,580
You knew that she was ugly, but you couldn't resist me.

737
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,580
Now what goes up must come back down.

738
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,580
So you better get out of town.

739
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,580
What was I thinking?

740
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,580
What was I thinking?

741
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,580
When I got some truck I saved my head.

742
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,580
Through a fun life, that's where it's been.

743
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,580
What was I thinking?

744
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,580
What was I thinking?

745
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,580
When I got some truck I saved my head.

746
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,580
Through a fun life, that's where it's been.

747
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,580
I was having naked in my hands.

748
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,580
And I woke up.

749
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,580
In the back of my neighbors, being a truck.

750
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:53,580
Yeah, what was I thinking?

751
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,580
What was I thinking?

752
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,580
When I got some truck I saved my head.

753
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,580
I'm going up with her mother.

754
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,580
What was I thinking?

755
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,580
What was I thinking?

756
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,580
When I got some truck I saved my head.

757
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,580
Through a fun life, that's where it's been.

758
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,580
What was I thinking?

759
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,580
What was I thinking?

760
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,580
When I got some truck I saved my head.

761
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,580
Through a fun life, that's where it's been.

762
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,580
That's where it's been.

763
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,580
Pot-save music rocks.

764
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,580
That's where it's going to go.

765
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,580
Shit.

766
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,580
Kylie Blansteef Cox Adam.

767
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,580
Ho-foss.

768
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,580
Three guys who grew up in redneck infested small towns.

769
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,580
With dreams of someday escaping the country back roads,

770
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,580
trailer parks and barn dances to be in a rock and roll band.

771
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
That was Junior.

772
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,580
God.

773
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
Isn't that awesome?

774
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,580
Oh God.

775
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,580
God.

776
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,580
Oh my God.

777
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,580
When I hear that, my blood starts to boil.

778
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,580
Oh yeah.

779
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,580
What I love to make that music.

780
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,580
So much.

781
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,580
You cannot do everything.

782
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,580
Someone else's blood was boiling while you were gone.

783
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,580
Oh yeah.

784
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,580
Your daughter was very pissed off at me.

785
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,580
Oh.

786
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,580
Yeah.

787
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,580
I don't think you've heard this.

788
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,580
I should play this for you.

789
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
Where are you?

790
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,580
I called you 20 minutes ago and you never called me back.

791
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,580
You told me I did it that you were going to pick me up at 11.

792
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,580
And if I know you're going to play, I would have made other plans.

793
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,580
This is like the third time recently that you promised to do something to me.

794
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,580
Dad, I'm completely flaked out on me.

795
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,580
I understand you have to work in your busy, but I'm your daughter.

796
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,580
Will you promise me something?

797
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,580
Something is simple.

798
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,580
I was coming to pick me up when you say you're going to pick me up.

799
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,580
Then you do it.

800
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,580
I'm so not fucking standing here in the middle of the night on the sidewalk.

801
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,580
Like some crazy homeless person.

802
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,580
I'm really getting sick of this shit dad.

803
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,580
You keep making all these promises.

804
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,580
I can't tell you more that you are the weed topic.

805
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,580
You're trying to run a little stone or pot head.

806
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,580
And now I'm going to have to fucking take a taxi all the way home.

807
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,580
And when I get there, you and I get to have a little talk about responsibility.

808
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,580
And when I tell you, better be standing out the day with enough money to pay for this cat.

809
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,580
And you fucking better be wearing men's clothing.

810
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,580
No!

811
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,580
Isn't she a little actress?

812
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,580
She's so good.

813
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,580
And you know, have you seen that footage of David Hasselhoff?

814
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,580
Dude!

815
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,580
I watched that yesterday.

816
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
How sad is that?

817
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,580
I was in Holland.

818
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,580
That's his daughter.

819
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,580
That's his daughter.

820
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,580
She's right.

821
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,580
She's, you know what?

822
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Absolutely right.

823
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,580
Yeah.

824
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,580
We're doing the same thing.

825
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,580
Same thing.

826
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,580
Oh yeah.

827
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,580
This is good.

828
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
Did you see how, well, the first of all, the guy is ill.

829
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,580
Alcoholism is a sickness.

830
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,580
It's a sickness dude.

831
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,580
I mean, it's not like he's choosing to do that.

832
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
He's sick.

833
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,580
He needs help.

834
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
He says dead.

835
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,580
Will you please stop?

836
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,580
Please do it for me.

837
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,580
It's just, it breaks your heart.

838
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
Broody breaks your heart.

839
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
The guy is sick.

840
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,580
If I hear the other side, because I thought it was,

841
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,580
There's another side.

842
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,580
Well, no, if I hear the other side,

843
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,580
It's like, you know, where you got the,

844
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,580
The, the, the,

845
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,580
Oh, Ale balled when you made that.

846
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,580
Yeah.

847
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,580
Then I'm all before, for him,

848
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,580
Because I know it's happening there.

849
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,580
Yeah.

850
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,580
You know.

851
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,580
And you can feel that the pain that he has is, as a dead,

852
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,580
Yeah.

853
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,580
That he feels a very,

854
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,580
Uh, hurt and, and push the side.

855
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,580
Push the side.

856
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,580
Mm-hmm.

857
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,580
You can hear that.

858
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,580
And so I assure hope that people are not going to be angry with him

859
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,580
Because that's totally different.

860
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,580
But I also think.

861
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
A different story.

862
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,580
People shouldn't be angry.

863
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,580
There's a lot of dead, you know, who are in this position.

864
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,580
Mm-hmm.

865
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,580
And, uh, he really loves his daughter.

866
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,580
That's why he's saying this.

867
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,580
Yeah.

868
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,580
That's why he's acting like that.

869
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,580
Absolutely.

870
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,580
So that's the other way around.

871
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,580
But if I see, um, a David, David has a...

872
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,580
Dude, the man is sick.

873
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,580
He needs help.

874
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,580
You know, we shouldn't be angry at him.

875
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
He needs help.

876
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,580
That's sad.

877
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
How cool isn't, is a sickness.

878
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,580
You can't just say,

879
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,580
I'm not going to drink.

880
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,580
It doesn't work that way.

881
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,580
Well, you had some experience with that with family.

882
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,580
So it's...

883
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,580
Thank you.

884
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,580
That would be my point.

885
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,580
Yeah.

886
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,580
That's painful.

887
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,580
So this, although, hopefully, this will get him into rehab.

888
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,580
Because that's where he needs to be.

889
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,580
He needs...

890
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,580
He needs professional help, dude.

891
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,580
Yeah.

892
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,580
This guy was, I mean, he was combatose.

893
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,580
He couldn't even...

894
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,580
Yeah.

895
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,580
Think straight.

896
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,580
You are still hurt from that.

897
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,580
From your youth.

898
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,580
I'm very bummed about David Hasselhoff.

899
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,580
No, no, no.

900
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,580
From this heart position.

901
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,580
Yeah, sure.

902
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,580
Sure.

903
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,580
You know, it's...

904
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,580
But it's an illness.

905
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,580
And it needs to be addressed.

906
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,580
And he should be so ashamed.

907
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,580
And I bet you no one's doing anything.

908
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
Because that's how it always goes.

909
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,580
Well, I'm going to laugh at the guy.

910
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,580
But we're not going to actually...

911
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,580
Well, please don't laugh about these things.

912
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,580
Because...

913
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,580
Well, I was pretty funny.

914
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,580
Yeah.

915
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,580
It was shocking.

916
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,580
No, I...

917
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,580
For me, he was shocking.

918
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,580
Yeah, it was pretty shocking.

919
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,580
It's disgusting.

920
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,580
I was so disgusted by it.

921
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,580
Yeah.

922
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,580
Unbelievable.

923
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,580
But our daughter is...

924
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,580
Is an actress.

925
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,580
No, that was good.

926
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,580
She did...

927
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,580
She did that just like that?

928
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,580
Oh, yeah.

929
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
Oh, my god.

930
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,580
I gave her the script that Mark wrote for her.

931
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Yeah.

932
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,580
She did it in like three seconds with her.

933
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Hang it out of the window with herself.

934
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,580
Aw.

935
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,580
Yeah, it's great.

936
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
No, we love you.

937
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,580
You're good, Daddy.

938
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
That's speaking to which.

939
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,580
Now you want to talk about how cool I am.

940
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,580
It's my turn now.

941
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,580
Yeah, it's now.

942
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,580
It's my turn to hear how great I am.

943
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,580
Talk about me.

944
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,580
Yeah, do you mind just talking about me for a moment?

945
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,580
No.

946
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,580
So I was flying KLA yesterday.

947
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,580
Yes, you were.

948
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,580
Yes, you were.

949
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,580
And you were happy I did it.

950
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580
I'm very happy.

951
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,580
Did I?

952
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,580
Did I had a good feeling?

953
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,580
You had the right feeling, dude.

954
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,580
I mean, you would have been okay because I was not freaked out.

955
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,580
I was not...

956
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,580
No, it was not flying with you.

957
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,580
It was flying in certain conditions.

958
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,580
Now conditions and circumstances.

959
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,580
Because, you know, you never know what the heart is doing.

960
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,580
If you get sort of a little bit of panic, you don't know that.

961
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,580
No, that's my point.

962
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,580
So with what happened once I hit like, you know,

963
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,580
once I flew over the coast, what happened there was not fun.

964
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,580
And only because I've been in it before,

965
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,580
that I realized that we were bouncing.

966
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,580
It was, it was not everything.

967
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,580
I had the bouncing ball.

968
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,580
I had to slow down to like 100 knots just because I would have flipped over.

969
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,580
I mean, it was just amazing.

970
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,580
The wind that was hitting me.

971
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,580
Can you imagine me sitting there next to you?

972
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,580
I was so happy.

973
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,580
I was like, oh man.

974
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,580
You're copilot?

975
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
Me?

976
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,580
You would have been like...

977
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,580
I mean, I know you can hear it.

978
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,580
But who knows?

979
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,580
I mean, you know, you...

980
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,580
I'm not...

981
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,580
I'm never getting nauseous.

982
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,580
You know, I'm good at that.

983
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,580
Dude.

984
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,580
And while I was listening on the radio,

985
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,580
because I was monitoring our frequencies.

986
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,580
Oh, yeah.

987
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,580
It was like, you know, go off, go off, pop in, you're trying to go.

988
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,580
Returning back to the field.

989
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,580
Due to an ill passenger.

990
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,580
Oh, yeah.

991
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,580
Oh, I can just imagine that cockpit.

992
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,580
Like, oh, no!

993
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,580
Oh, God.

994
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,580
Yeah.

995
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,580
Yeah.

996
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,580
Oh, big jets.

997
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,580
You know, not being able...

998
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,580
Not being able to land, doing go runs and stuff.

999
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,580
And at that point, I was like, oh crap.

1000
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,580
No crap.

1001
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,580
I said, oh, please don't let it be like that at Fair Oaks,

1002
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,580
which of course it was.

1003
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,580
So big jets dripping from throw up.

1004
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,580
No, I didn't see that.

1005
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,580
Okay.

1006
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,580
You know, I should put some bags in the plane,

1007
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,580
just in case we have someone on board.

1008
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,580
Yeah.

1009
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,580
I was thinking, what happens if I have a sudden got nauseous while I'm alone

1010
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,580
and flying?

1011
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,580
There you go.

1012
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,580
What do you do?

1013
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,580
Because I do know a little bit about helicopter.

1014
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,580
You could always say, take it off.

1015
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,580
Just keep it steady.

1016
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,580
Yeah.

1017
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,580
You know, but...

1018
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,580
You couldn't have kept anything steady in this weather.

1019
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,580
No.

1020
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Nothing at all.

1021
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
I know.

1022
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,580
But, you know, you never go up with the helicopter in that weather.

1023
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,580
Anyway.

1024
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,580
Well, what do you...

1025
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,580
What do you...

1026
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,580
We've done there.

1027
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,580
We've done 40, 40 not wins.

1028
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,580
We've done it before.

1029
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,580
You've been in there.

1030
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,580
But I do know the helicopter.

1031
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,580
I know how it works.

1032
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,580
But I don't know anything about this.

1033
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,580
Nothing.

1034
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,580
I couldn't help you.

1035
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,580
So, I mean, you wouldn't have to do anything.

1036
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,580
I'd just throw up and continue.

1037
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,580
Yeah.

1038
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,580
Yeah.

1039
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,580
Well, we have to buy a autopilot for you.

1040
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,580
autopilot.

1041
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,580
Sorry.

1042
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,580
Another pilot.

1043
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,580
Yeah.

1044
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,580
I mean, I mean, I have an autopilot.

1045
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,580
I mean, like a serious one.

1046
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,580
Now, when you want to...

1047
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,580
You want me to...

1048
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,580
Yeah.

1049
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,580
All the money you make, you're going to put into the plane.

1050
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,580
Oh, no.

1051
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
You're going to buy an autopilot.

1052
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,580
Okay.

1053
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,580
I'll save up.

1054
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,580
And a Gucci bag.

1055
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,580
And a Gucci bag to throw up in.

1056
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:26,580
Now, at www.watsup.potcho.com.

1057
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,580
Join Mike Dell and Jim Farley for a podcast.

1058
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,580
That will make you say, dude, what's up with that?

1059
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:40,580
Jim and Mike talk about the new stories that you probably didn't hear about on your radio dial.

1060
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,580
You know the ones.

1061
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,580
The ones that make you say...

1062
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,580
What's up with that?

1063
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,580
What's up with that?

1064
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,580
All in back on the time honored descent.

1065
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,580
Namely, his claim that he believed he was a female elf at the time.

1066
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,580
Uh, well, fast and proud.

1067
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,580
What's up with that?

1068
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,580
Hey.

1069
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,580
What's up with that?

1070
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:03,580
Police were looking for a person after we were able to flush the suspect out from the portable toilet

1071
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,580
where he was hiding.

1072
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,580
A porta-potty is not a good place to hide, but there's only one way out.

1073
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,580
Well, technically, there's two.

1074
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,580
Dude, what's up with that?

1075
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,580
We also play a wide-bradding musical

1076
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,580
the pot-safe music network.

1077
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,580
So stop on over and give us a listen.

1078
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,580
What's up with that?

1079
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,580
What's up with that?

1080
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,580
What's up with that?

1081
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,580
What's up with that?

1082
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,580
What's up with that?

1083
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,580
Yeah.

1084
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,580
All right.

1085
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,580
I got to go to the city, baby.

1086
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,580
I got to hurry up.

1087
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,580
I know.

1088
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,580
You know, I could talk.

1089
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
In fact, we have been talking for the past three days.

1090
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,580
Non-stop.

1091
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,580
And we're still talking.

1092
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,580
Yeah.

1093
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,580
Didn't we have a good time?

1094
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
We had a great time.

1095
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,580
Yeah.

1096
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,580
Yesterday, I said...

1097
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,580
It was enjoying life so much.

1098
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,580
We had a great time.

1099
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,580
I accomplished something major for myself.

1100
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,580
You know, it was wonderful.

1101
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,580
The moment that we were all by ourselves.

1102
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,580
And it was raining outside.

1103
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,580
Exactly what I told them.

1104
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
Yeah.

1105
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,580
That was beautiful.

1106
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,580
It was raining against the...

1107
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,580
Well, the awning.

1108
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,580
Yeah.

1109
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,580
And all you could hear was the ducks.

1110
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,580
Yeah.

1111
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,580
And the two of us, making love.

1112
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,580
Oh, baby.

1113
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,580
I can't stand up now.

1114
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,580
I can't go anywhere.

1115
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,580
I can't go anywhere.

1116
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,580
All right.

1117
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,580
So will you keep us on the high?

1118
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,580
Yeah.

1119
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,580
We all...

1120
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,580
Let us know what's going on.

1121
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,580
Because we want to know what's happening with Afghanistan, baby.

1122
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,580
You know, we also have to...

1123
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,580
Don't forget, it can't be in August.

1124
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,580
Because we have to go to the big curry reunion.

1125
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,580
And upstate New York.

1126
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,580
Me grow.

1127
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,580
Yeah.

1128
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,580
So it can't be in August.

1129
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,580
But what if they say then, you know, that's when it needs to...

1130
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,580
Sorry.

1131
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,580
You're Patricia Pai, dude.

1132
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,580
Change the course of the war.

1133
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
Okay.

1134
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,580
It's...

1135
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,580
It's June, July.

1136
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,580
Okay.

1137
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
Is it hot?

1138
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,580
You do.

1139
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,580
Dude.

1140
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,580
I think you may not want to go in August anyway.

1141
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,580
It could easily be...

1142
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,580
And July, hot.

1143
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,580
Oh, man.

1144
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,580
It's so freaking hot.

1145
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,580
We went in February.

1146
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,580
In Iraq, and it was a...

1147
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,580
30 degrees.

1148
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,580
Yeah.

1149
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,580
In the...

1150
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,580
Well, you get sandstorms.

1151
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,580
Yeah.

1152
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,580
Yeah.

1153
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,580
Absolutely.

1154
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,580
Sandstorms.

1155
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,580
Oh, no.

1156
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,580
If you think this is...

1157
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,580
I'm allergic for dust.

1158
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,580
If you think it's a fun party, you're in...

1159
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,580
No, no.

1160
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,580
I don't think that at all.

1161
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,580
No, but I'm saying is...

1162
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,580
It definitely...

1163
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,580
Because I said to the guys, I said, look, getting to...

1164
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,580
Camp Smitty in Iraq was kind of a journey.

1165
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,580
You know, so we...

1166
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,580
Could we had to fly to Kuwait City first and from Kuwait City.

1167
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,580
We drove 400 kilometers through the...

1168
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,580
Through the desert essentially to get to the camp.

1169
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,580
And I said, is it kind of like that kind of journey.

1170
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,580
He said, no, about three times as bad.

1171
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,580
Oh.

1172
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,580
Two military planes and the helicopter just to get to the first base.

1173
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
Wow.

1174
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,580
I'm a beaker.

1175
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,580
With you getting to first base is much easier.

1176
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,580
Oh, oh.

1177
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,580
All right.

1178
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,580
All right.

1179
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,580
Yeah, we are.

1180
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,580
All right.

1181
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,580
And I'll be here for a couple more days.

1182
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,580
Yeah, that's good.

1183
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,580
Please enjoy me.

1184
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,580
Yes, I am.

1185
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,580
Please enjoy your time with...

1186
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,580
Yeah.

1187
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,580
With the Sultan.

1188
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,580

1189
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,580

1190
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,580
