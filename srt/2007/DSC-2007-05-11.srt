1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
1.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
1.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
3.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
3.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
3.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
3.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I like to think I'm shining in the street.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I just can't feel your joy.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Five, nine, nine, nine.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Maximum music from our Friday.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Everybody is quick.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's you.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You got a lot.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You got a lot.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You got a lot.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We have you.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And two of the best.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, two of the best.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That we like to do.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, two of the best.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Me, a lot.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Who get down tonight.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm like it, down tonight.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm a fool of ya.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Me, a lot.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's all right.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't think it's all right.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't think it's all right.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Baby, babe.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll meet you in the wild.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:22,000
shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake,

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:52,000
shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, Liu, Liu, Liu, Liu,

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And I'm gonna get down to the house

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm gonna get down to the house

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm gonna get down to the house

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm gonna get down to the house

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm gonna get down to the house

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
When in the Charlie Harry case you can see

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and the sunshine man

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Have you thinking how the hell can I justify playing this

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
as well those two reasons one is

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've made so much money for the guy

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
playing this song throughout my entire career

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's like 1978

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sure he'll let me slide.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And the second reason is you need to hear the song once in a while.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's important. It's like medicine.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You know, I can't just be deprived of music like this.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You've got to hear it. In fact, I am...

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, I'm almost like a modern-day jack-a-a-cavorean.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
To a side, Dr. Guy.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You need the medicine. The doctor has to give it to you.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Everybody, it's a daily source code.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Wow, episode number 599. Monday will be 600.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
A beautiful day today.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
At least if you like cloud activity.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Column is nimbus clouds forming.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We're going to have thunderstorms later on in the afternoon.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But right now it's just a little windy.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The sun is poking through.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But it's going to be shitty later on today.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Of course, here is Gilford, west side of G-town in the curry manner.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And of course, you are now welcome in Adam's addict for the maximum music.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Football Friday, which means we're going to bring it to you.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Back to back with his little bullshit as possible.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh, yeah.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hey, baby. Let me get the other mic ready.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Baby, Mac, everybody.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hello, Amy.

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Hey, Adam. It's Amy Mac.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hey, baby.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hey, yeah.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It seems like it's been forever.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You were out of town.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I was out of town.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, it's my phone.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, it's my phone.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's exciting stuff at HQ.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I love it stuff.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's just crazy around here.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Today we're back at it.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
How much you love the squatting muscles?

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We're going to squat with a kickback.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, boy.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're going to kick that.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Standing tall, shoulders back, abs butt tight.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And then squat down until you're 90 degrees to your knees.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And then on the way back up, lift the right leg behind you and squeeze that butt.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hold it.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And then bring it down.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Now squat again.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And on the way up, lift that left leg.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Squeeze.

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hold.

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And down.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Keep going.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Tell me to breathe.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Tell me to breathe.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Tell me to breathe.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You are out of shape, are you?

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Uh, uh, no.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Breathe.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes.

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Make sure to keep that chest up with shoulders back.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Keep going.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Two more.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
All right.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, and by the way, I was looking at your pod show channels the other day.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And I noticed that none of my shows are in there.

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And you want me to make a video version of exercise.

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't know, Mr.

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're skating on thin ice.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, it looks like you looked out.

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm digging yourself out of that one because I'm all out of time.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So great job.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We'll see you next week.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And until next time.

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Bye.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I love it when I'm in the office.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Amy has to check out my ass.

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And she has to, you know, check for firmness and stuff.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And, uh, you know, she's married to the Firf.

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Chris McIntyre.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you stand right there, go on the wall.

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Here we go.

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Here we go.

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Better than the radio.

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Here we go.

142
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm thinking, oh, it's the radio guy.

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Are you doing a robotic?

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What's up, Mr. Adam Curry?

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's Ray Anthony.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The slightly inebriated radio guy.

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
My favorite kind.

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
On DSC number 598, you tried to compare the big three's the banjo song based on

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Osuzana with shocking blues, Venus.

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And, uh, you tried to play the songs over each other.

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Of course, the tempo's in the pitches were a little bit different.

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So, I decided to see if I can play around and get them to match up a little bit.

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay.

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Here's a little comparison for you to help make up your mind.

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Should be trippy.

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
90% left right hand.

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, wow.

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, my brain is hurting from this.

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's got it.

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, cool.

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's made the eye matches.

163
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Right.

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah.

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah.

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I got it.

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I got it.

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I got it.

170
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I got it.

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is the stop.

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The turning my head.

173
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's interesting.

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I would love to hear what kind of mashup someone could do with these two songs.

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You know, it's been a while since we've heard a good mashup on the DSC.

176
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I had them.

177
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
True.

178
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't know how else to close this, so...

179
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000

206
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,920
It's Jersey Todd, the official musicologist of the Chacha.

207
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,280
Have I got a band for you this week?

208
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,760
It's Tito Felix out of Atlanta, Georgia, and I like these guys a lot.

209
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,160
If you go over to their website, you can download their last album, the 2006 album, all

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,400
It's a Tetris Ice Cream Terradacto Lanamonopea Felix like a cat.

217
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,800
I don't know, man.

220
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
I think you're going to like this song a lot.

221
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,080
The song is Exquisitness on a football Friday.

222
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,880
This is just great, great stuff.

223

Another party

228
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,300
Measuring time for me

229
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,580
I take all the love and consciousness

230
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,380
With your mother and our peasants

231
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,880
It's not exactly where

232
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Your body is starting

233
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,880
You're sinking down to the most of it

234
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,880
It's been a dream since last

235
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,380
It's where you're now

236
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,380
It's not exactly where

237
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,380
Your body is starting

238
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,380
You're sinking down to the most of it

239
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,380
It's been a dream since last

It's been a dream since last

It's been a dream since last

00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,380
It's been a dream since last

251
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,380
It's been a dream since last

252
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,380
It's been a dream since last

253
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,380
It's been a dream since last

254
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,380
It's been a dream since last

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,380
It's been a dream since last

256
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,380
It's been a dream since last

257
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,380
It's been a dream since last

258
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,380
It's been a dream since last

259
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,380
It's been a dream since last

260
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,380
It's been a dreaming since last

261
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,380
It's been a dream since last

262
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:39,380
I'm sorry for the hurt me and I'm sorry

263
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,380
I'm sorry for the hurt me and I'm sorry

264
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:47,380
I'm sorry for the hurt me and I'm sorry for the hurt me and I'm sorry

265
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,380
I'm sorry for the hurt me and I'm sorry

266
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,380
Close the pig quasi

267
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,380
Close the pig quasi

268
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,380
Clueless�� waste. Do you really know what's best

269
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,380
With some luck the song will shine right through

270
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,380
From the valley over to the Bay

271
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,380
Learnin' more everyday

272
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,380
Just see it all inside the foumn field

273
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:18,380
See it all inside the foumn view

274
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:24,620
Hi Adam, this is Tom from the Fog View podcast, and yes that was the great Greg Smith

275
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,100
doing the intro.

276
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,420
Now I don't want to step on Jersey Todd's toes, but I found an artist brand new to the

277
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,100
PMN who'd be great for Fubar Friday.

278
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,500
Now she has two songs in the PMN which I played on my show last week, but no one else

279
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,900
has ever played her music.

280
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,700
Now I feel she has a lot of talent in what to introduce you and the DSC listeners to her

281
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,700
music.

282
00:15:44,700 --> 00:16:00,900
So without further ado, here is Carry Cutting Ham with a single life.

283
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:07,900
I say goodbye, not knowing if I scream or cry, I'm heading for a brand new life.

284
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:15,140
I slam the door and clean the mix, slipped into my brand new dress, that red one makes me feel

285
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,140
the best.

286
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:28,620
But Wendy, I need her pen, I'm fly out, I'm superman, boy it's never late, I'm the guest

287
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:58,620
and I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best,

288
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:28,620
I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best, I

289
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,620
I'm leaving the sky

290
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,620
Who says you happiness with someone

291
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,620
To pay for rent a fine with my temper's hand

292
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Yeah

293
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,620
I'm leaving the single life

294
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,620
Dancing both the nights

295
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,620
I'm not baby scared

296
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,620
I'm leaving the single life

297
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,620
Dancing both the nights

298
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,620
Dancing both the nights

299
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,620
I'm leaving the single life

300
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,620
I'm leaving the day

301
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,620
Yeah

302
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,620
This one's gonna come

303
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,620
I'm gonna do everything

304
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,620
I'm gonna do everything

305
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,620
Yeah

306
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,620
And as usual, with female country artists

307
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,620
She's mine

308
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,620
I love that

309
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,620
I love that

310
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,620
Carry cutting him on the Fubar Friday

311
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,620
Maximum music

312
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,620
Feels like my ears are out of whack there

313
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,620
Here we go

314
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,620
Did you just hear your right ear go louder?

315
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,620
Was it left?

316
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
He he he he

317
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
Some savance checkin' in

318
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,620
Which is always nice to hear

319
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,620
Don't let the blue winner

320
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,620
At your command it's the

321
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
Don't let the blue winner

322
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,620
But where are you?

323
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,620
I am prolific for them

324
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
I'm here from San Francisco

325
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,620
I want to ask you a few questions regarding the piano

326
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,620
And in fact, the blood safety of the glycines

327
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,620
We may hear what we may hear

328
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,620
Does cover songs for various

329
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,620
Disfor various clubs and the workplaces

330
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,620
Of like that

331
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,620
He was wondering

332
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,620
He went to say

333
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,620
Sing a song

334
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,620
Say it was

335
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,620
I'm living on a private one

336
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,620
Give it

337
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,620
It's right to sing this song

338
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,620
And put the music in that work

339
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,620
And give it a buy it

340
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,620
Say me

341
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,620
Would you get the ram here?

342
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
We have a bunch of things

343
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
We have come here

344
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
What's the deal there?

345
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,620
Okay

346
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,620
Thank you

347
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,620
Alright

348
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,620
prolific program

349
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620
Let me let me just be very very clear

350
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,620
What the hell it sounds

351
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,620
So like my connecters are all messed up again

352
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
Hey

353
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,620
No, that would not be permissible

354
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,620
You have to be the

355
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,620
The copyright owner

356
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,620
Or representative there of

357
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,620
Of the words and music

358
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,620
That is so besides having

359
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,620
Being the owner of the master of the song

360
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,620
So the original recording

361
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,620
You also

362
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,620
Must own the words in the lyrics

363
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,620
In order to be able to put it up

364
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,620
Of the pot safe music network

365
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Now that can be done

366
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,620
But you'd have to get signed off from Bon Jovi

367
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,620
And that may be a little bit too difficult

368
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,620
And why Bon Jovi is the question of course

369
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
Ladies and gentlemen

370
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,620
Friday

371
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,620
Hey

372
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,620
11

373
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,620
2007

374
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,620
The football Friday

375
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,620
Goes maximum music

376
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,620
As we bring the mood down

377
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,620
For granted landing

378
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,620
As I'm tapping through all main

379
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,620
Formation quick when to find out where the heck they're from

380
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,620
This is wonderful tragedy

381
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,620
Now I'll really have to go

382
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,620
Let's go now

383
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,620
Let's go

384
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,620
Let's go

385
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,620
Let's go

386
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,620
Let's go

387
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,620
Let's go

388
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,620
Let's go

389
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,620
Let's go

390
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,620
Let's go

391
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,620
Let's go

392
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,620
Let's go

393
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,620
Let's go

394
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,620
Let's go

395
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,620
Let's go

396
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,620
Let's go

397
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,620
Let's go

398
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,620
Let's go

399
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,620
Let's go

400
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,620
Let's go

401
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,620
Let's go

402
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,620
Let's go

403
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,620
Let's go

404
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,620
Let's go

405
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,620
Let's go

406
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
Let's go

407
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,620
Let's go

408
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,620
Let's go

00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,620
Let's go

410
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,620
Let's go

411
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,620
Let's go

412
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,620
Let's go

413
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,620
Let's go

414
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,620
Let's go

415
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,620
Let's go

416
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,620
Let's go

417
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,620
Let's go

418
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,620
Let's go

419
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,620
Let's go

420
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,620

00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,620
Let's go

425
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
Let's go

426
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,620
Let's go

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:31,620

watching this video, thank you very much to these who are here

432
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,340
that you're gonna be hearing a lot more from the Grand Atlantic.

433
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,600
Wonderful tragedy on a footballer Friday,

434
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,240
maximum music footballer Friday.

435
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,000
And that sounded so much like a song that I know.

436
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,560
I'm looking now in Napster with the hell.

437
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,680
It was like the Carpenterers.

438
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,000
Didn't sound like that long ago.

439
00:24:45,000 --> 00:25:05,100
Yeah I'm looking at the titles of the same.

440
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,420
oh no no no no no no

441
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,100
is that yesterday once more

442
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,740
it's yesterday once more

443
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,020
let's see if that's it

444
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,260
if not, we continue with the rest of the show

445
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,460
that's listening, connecting to media buffering

446
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,660
when I was young

447
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,260
crap, that's not the one

448
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,660
ah, who cares?

449
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,660
more country and body.

450
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,660
Yeah!

451
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,660
The body of eight emails this week for this track alone.

452
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,660
Bobby shit would bear toast.

453
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,660
There's beer.

454
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,660
Every day of the year and there's toast.

455
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,660
You're along with him.

456
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,660
Let's down beer.

457
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,660
Those ass what we're doing here.

458
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,660
Trapped along the egg.

459
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,660
They're my best friend.

460
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,660
Colorado got clean.

461
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,660
Why do they brew that couse out there?

462
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Miller lied, did they brew there?

463
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,660
But nobody really cares.

464
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,660
And down in Texas, they got that beer.

465
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,660
They make shout-or-lones,

466
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,660
Darcy again, fucking good old text pride.

467
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,660
We got salmon, but I've thrown a soul as trash.

468
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,660
Let's go 45, but don't fear.

469
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,660
We got Fausters, Fanta,

470
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,660
Homu, at the crack, my rap.

471
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,660
Burn my dark with yellow label.

472
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,660
I miss you, and it's just beer we make.

473
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
A great couple here.

474
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,660
So here's to your hell, then hang over.

475
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,660
You're along with beer.

476
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,660
We've got these things here.

477
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,660
They've kind of put us in the party mood.

478
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,660
You may want to plug your ears.

479
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,660
Because some of these toasts that you hear.

480
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,660
They may be considered counter-rood.

481
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,660
Yeah, friends may come and friends may go.

482
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,660
And friends may Peter out, you know.

483
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,660
But we'll be friends until the end.

484
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,660
Peter out and Peter in.

485
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,660
There's you, and here's to me.

486
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
And friends forever, we'll be.

487
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,660
If we should ever disagree.

488
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,660
Here's to me, we got salmon,

489
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,660
But I've thrown a soul as trash.

490
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,660
Let's go 45, but don't fear.

491
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,660
We got Fausters, Fanta,

492
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,660
Homu, at the crack, my rap.

493
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,660
Burn my dark with yellow label.

494
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,660
I'm this human, it's just barely my right couple here.

495
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,660
So here's to your hell, then hang over.

496
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,660
But some of them burned, didn't fly away.

497
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,660
Based, didn't die.

498
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,660
Dogs didn't stick together.

499
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,660
So here's to you, and I.

500
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,660
So raise him, drink one last time.

501
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,660
Saying the course right here.

502
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,660
There's nothing better to sing about than here.

503
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,660
We got salmon, but I've thrown a soul as trash.

504
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,660
Let's go 45, but don't fear.

505
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,660
We got Fausters, Fanta,

506
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,660
Homu, at the crack, my rap.

507
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,660
Burn my dark with yellow label.

508
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:37,660
I'm this human, it's just barely my right couple here.

509
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,660
So here's to your hell, then hang over.

510
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,660
Yeah, here's to your hell, then hang over.

511
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,660
Yeah, here's to your hell, then hang over.

512
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,660
I can check what about another round over here.

513
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,660
Human, I like country music, but you can't resist.

514
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,660
Sing along with all the different labels of beer.

515
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,660
I'm telling you, eight different emails, which is pretty unprecedented.

516
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,660
So if someone out there is digging it for sure.

517
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,660
Hey, tonight is Christina's prom, so we're all kind of excited.

518
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,660
Mom has been working on altering the dress for the, you know, for the past couple days.

519
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:22,660
And her buddies have a, you know, huge limo lined up and, you know, it's prom.

520
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,660
I was like, I remember looking out the window in New Jersey and seeing the big limo.

521
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:32,660
It's pull up with the neighbor's houses where their teenage sons and daughters were being picked up to go to their prom.

522
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,660
And there you go, it's another life experience.

523
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,660
It's now part of our life.

524
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,660
Yeah.

525
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,660
Hey, I think I'm going to do some more flying on Sunday where there's going to get better.

526
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,660
I may even go to over to Antwerp and return the Wing Commander's headsets.

527
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,660
You know, can you believe this?

528
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,660
I bought a pair of these Clark headsets.

529
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,660
Now, these are the green ones you've seen them, I'm sure.

530
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,660
They're used for all types of industry, not just for air, of course.

531
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,660
So fixed wing helicopters, but television camera men use them.

532
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,660
We used to use them for radio stuff until better headsets came along.

533
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,660
Somehow I blew mine up.

534
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,660
I don't understand one of the speakers is just completely shot.

535
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,660
I know I'm definitely defer than I was as a young man,

536
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,660
and that I do like to turn the volume up a little bit, but I do.

537
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,660
It would actually blow them out.

538
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,660
Clydon, this is Mike the Bee.

539
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,660
I just wanted to say to us to you for your flight and to Patricia for the show.

540
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,660
I watched all YouTube links and Patricia just seemed to light up the stage.

541
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,660
And I see the star sisters are now up on the Potset Music Network,

542
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,660
which is great.

543
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,660
I've been waiting for them.

544
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,660
We'll be featuring them on the next podcast.

545
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,660
I know something about what your cross-channel trip was like,

546
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,660
and you did so well.

547
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,660
I really listened to that commentary and felt for you.

548
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,660
When I was waiting for my first solo cross-country flight,

549
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,660
I struggled to find an available day with wind less than 25 knots,

550
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,660
and it took me ages, so I know how it is for you.

551
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,660
I think recording a trip like that would have been one extra task too many, even for you.

552
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,660
Excuse my horse free of voice.

553
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,660
I've been suffering from some terrible flu情.

554
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,660
Maybe there's something I picked up at the Redding Bay Festival last weekend.

555
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,660
I know you're not a real drinker, but the Redding Bay Festival is one of campaign for real owls.

556
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,660
It is the real owls festivals, and I recorded a soundscape tour,

557
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,660
which people can find at in wokenham.podshow.com.

558
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,660
Cheers Adam.

559
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,660
Slange.

560
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,660
Yeah, it's cool because I put the star suit well.

561
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,660
I didn't.

562
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,660
The label put the star suit's up on the pod save music network,

563
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,660
and the five different shows have played it so far.

564
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,660
I believe she's coming sailing into the pod save music countdown top 10 this weekend.

565
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,660
It's great.

566
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,660
I'm surprised to all money.

567
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,660
Oh, what?

568
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,660
Something buggy here.

569
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,660
There we go.

570
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,660
I'm very happy.

571
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
I'm very, very happy.

572
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,660
We're now ramping up this trip to Afghanistan,

573
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
and we're going to get an update next week,

574
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,660
but it looks like we're allowed to take 15 people.

575
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,660
So that means that I will be doing video.

576
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,660
I will be doing audio.

577
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,660
We'll be doing daily updates.

578
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,660
We'll do a full blown special.

579
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,660
As far as I can see,

580
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,660
it podshow will be producing it.

581
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,660
So that's going to be extremely exciting because we'll be doing stuff.

582
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Obviously for television in the Netherlands and online for podshow.

583
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,660
We won't just be at, you know, with the Dutch troops,

584
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,660
we'll be with the international troops.

585
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,660
So it's going to be pretty damn exciting.

586
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
And regarding the flying, yeah.

587
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,660
I don't think there would be a problem to record it.

588
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,660
What I do is I just, you know,

589
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,660
basically turn on the recording before I start up,

590
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,660
and then turn it off when I've landed and I shut down.

591
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,660
Hey, I'm talking to myself in the air anyway.

592
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,660
You guys might as well listen.

593
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:56,660
1, 2, 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7,

594
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:04,660
1, 1, 2, 1, 6, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7.

595
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:11,660
Hey Adam, congratulations on 600 episodes.

596
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,660
You know, it seems like only yesterday that we were scratching our heads,

597
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,660
wondering what the hell this podcasting thing was all about.

598
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,660
Now I can't imagine what I did before.

599
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:27,660
May 16th will mark the second anniversary of my podcast match today in history.

600
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:32,660
I just wanted to say thanks to all of you who have taken the time to listen and send your comments.

601
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:38,660
You continually remind me that the podcast listeners and producers are community

602
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,660
in every sense of the world.

603
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:47,660
Adam, thanks for keeping the torch held high so that we can all see what promise that you can hold.

604
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,660
Catch my show at matchtodanehistory.plodshow.com.

605
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,660
Oh, one more thing.

606
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,660
Hybrid folder, scruncher, roller.

607
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,660
Or I can make a hat or a broach or a terradactor.

608
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,660
Never mind.

609
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Amen. Thank you. Congratulations.

610
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,660
Hey Adam, it's Dan Johnson from Cincinnati, Ohio.

611
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:14,660
I wanted to tell you about Michael Alive and artists that's here local to the area.

612
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:20,660
I want a personal mission to give him hints of Michael and his father Brian that pursuing a major record deals not the way to go.

613
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,660
And that they can promote their music through podcasting and other new media.

614
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,660
And I was recently able to convince Brian his father.

615
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:33,660
Also his chief support and producer to put the title track of Michael's album Modern Love up at the PMN.

616
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:41,660
And also to submit the CD to CD baby so they can get some sales that way of their CD on the title track.

617
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,660
Mike plays all the instruments himself and does the leading backing vocals.

618
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,660
To describe his sound.

619
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,660
I mean imagine if the strokes met radiohead and then they had a baby with wiser and jet.

620
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,660
Oh, that's hot.

621
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,660
You'd be on the right track.

622
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,660
Now I checked over at Michael's my space page and it says that he sounds like pair of sultons

623
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,660
and or actually sums them without pitch correction in pro tools.

624
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:10,660
So give it a spin and be sure to have your listeners check out Michaeloliva.com for more information.

625
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,660
Thanks Adam.

626
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
Thank you for watching.

627
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,660
Thank you for watching.

628
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,660
Thank you for watching.

629
00:37:40,660 --> 00:38:05,660
Thank you for watching.

630
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,660
Michaeloliva Modern Love for playing this song.

631
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,660
This has been Michaeloliva.

632
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,660
My name is Dan Johnson.

633
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:22,660
You can find my mind podcast at jiammpodcast.com.

634
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,660
Okay.

635
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,660
Make it a great day.

636
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,660
Oh, make it an even better weekend, my friend.

637
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,660
Let's have some ground rules for the maximum music football Friday.

638
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,660
I love the submissions.

639
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,660
I also love the intro's, but please give them to me as two separate files.

640
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:41,660
Because A, I don't always want to play the intro, although the information will be relevant.

641
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,660
And if I do, maybe I want to mix it a little bit differently.

642
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,660
So if you don't mind.

643
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,660
Okay.

644
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,660
Because otherwise, I mean, why would I even show up at all?

645
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,660
That would make no sense.

646
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,660
By the way, next week we're going to do a live Charlie experiment.

647
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,660
Stay tuned for details.

648
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:11,660
4, 4, 2, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.

649
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:16,660
What's playing on the world?

650
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,660
Addles first and I find.

651
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
Well, of course, this is my favorite part of the show.

652
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,660
We rack up the old first generation iPod, the white one, the thick one that only held about.

653
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,660
Was it a 10 gig?

654
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,660
iPod was a 30.

655
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,660
Maybe it was six, I don't know.

656
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,660
Where do I find that on the backhand?

657
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,660
Yeah, it's definitely, no, it's actually 1.5.

658
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,660
Jen is what my first generation iPod is.

659
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,660
So let me just reiterate that sometimes next week I'm going to try and do a live

660
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Charlie all phone call addition.

661
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:53,660
I'm going to be trying out this new software or a new service I should say rather.

662
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:59,660
And see, see if we can get something going, see if we can make it work and see if there's some interesting

663
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,660
format change and we can make it that.

664
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,660
All on a second, let me get the first gen iPod rack up.

665
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,660
We're using the Friday only playlist, so you know that, well, it could be a surprise

666
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,660
where it comes out of it.

667
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,660
What's playing on?

668
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,660
Addles first and I find.

669
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,660
Oh, yes.

670
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,660
Oh, man, does this take you back?

671
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,660
This should make you happy for the weekend.

672
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,660
Aha.

673
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,660
Are these guys still around?

674
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,660
It's cool in the gang.

675
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,660
And celebrate.

676
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:09,660
It's a party going on right here.

677
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,660
A celebration, the life throughout the years.

678
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,660
So bring your good times and your life there too.

679
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,660
We're gonna celebrate your party with you.

680
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,660
Come on now.

681
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:33,660
Let's celebrate and have a good time.

00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,660
Celebration.

683

We go celebrate and have a good time.

684
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,660
It's time to come together.

685
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,660
It's up to you.

686
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,660
What's your pleasure?

687
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:56,660
It's a celebration.

688
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,660
It's a celebration.

689
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:10,660
It's a celebration.

690
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,660
It's a celebration.

691
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,660
It's a celebration.

692
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:24,660
Let's celebrate.

693
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,660
A dedication to life throughout the years.

694
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:33,660
So bring your good times and your life there too.

695
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,660
We're gonna celebrate and party with you.

696
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:41,660
Come on now.

697
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:49,660
Let's celebrate and have a good time.

698
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,660
We go celebrate and have a good time.

699
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,660
It's time to come together.

700
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,660

It's a celebration.

704
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:26,660
It's a celebration.

705

00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:34,660
Come on now.

707
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,660
Let's celebrate.

708
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,660
We're gonna have a good time tonight.

709
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,660
Let's celebrate.

710
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,660
It's all right.

711
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,660
We're gonna have a good time tonight.

712
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,660
Let's celebrate.

713
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,660
It's all right.

714
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,660
Let's celebrate.

715
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,660
It's all right.

716
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,660
It's all right.

717
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,660
Let's celebrate.

718
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,660
It's all right.

719
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:18,660
Let's celebrate.

720
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:24,660
It's all right.

721
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,660
Let's celebrate.

722
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,660
It's all right.

723
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,660
Let's celebrate.

724
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,660
It's all right.

725
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,660
Let's celebrate.

726
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:42,660
It's woken up today when there's five minutes single.

727
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,660
A complete repetition.

728
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,660
Cool the grey egg.

729
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,660
Cool the canned celebrate.

730
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,660
Of a very last episode.

731
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,660
avait scroll on the maximum music for bar Friday.

732
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,660
wait a minute.

733
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,660
It's Friday.

734
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,660
It's Friday.

735
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,660
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

736
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,660
Thursday, Thursday, Friday.

737
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,660
Adam's final fun on the Wii.

738
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,660
A little rough mixing there.

739
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,660
I do apologize.

740
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,660
Well, it's the end of a very good week for me, which actually started on Sunday.

741
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:24,660
As you've been listening along, you've been following the tales of Patricia's exploits,

742
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,660
and extravaganzo in the lowlands.

743
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,660
And of course, my life-altering experience,

744
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,660
the flying and interesting weather, solo across the English channel.

745
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,660
That, of course, will be the focus of the final thought of the week, because my friends,

746
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,660
what I've discovered is that when you do something completely new, something completely different,

747
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,660
something completely challenging, it is the most invigorating thing you can do.

748
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:53,660
I mean, I couldn't believe how incredibly alive I felt after just doing something different

749
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,660
and really challenging myself to do something that,

750
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,660
well, in this case, there was life or death involved.

751
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:04,660
So, I'm not suggesting you do that, but even if you just take a different route to work,

752
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:08,660
you know, turn left if you can, instead of going right at that intersection,

753
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,660
drive a different route.

754
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,660
Let's see what happens.

755
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,660
Life is full of surprises, and you can certainly surprise yourself when you grow it,

756
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,660
and you challenge yourself, and you do something new and undefined.

757
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:24,660
And that is a big part of my secret in success.

758
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,660
To happiness.

759
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,660
Oh, my goodness.

760
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,660
I really got to stop now. Hey, I'll talk to you guys on Monday.

761
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,660
I'm not going to do anything this weekend, because maybe a little bit of flying,

762
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,660
just going to chill out.

763
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,660
Of course, tonight, the big prom.

764
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,660
So, look for pictures on curry.com and on the flicker feed.

765
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:47,660
DailySourceco.com for the show notes, links to all of the songs played on today's show.

766
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,660
And, of course, you can always send me an email at ometpodshow.com.

767
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,660
Have a great weekend.

768
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,660
Don't forget to challenge yourself.

769
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,660
Bye-bye.

770
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,660
Another Pod Show Podcast.

771
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,660
Stick it in your ear.
