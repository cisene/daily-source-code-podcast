You're the place that I know

46

On the beach

60
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,480
Chris Rhea kind of puts you into the same vibe. Of course played courtesy of the

61
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,200
organization to the preservation to the soundtrack of our lives which enables

62
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,000
you to hear this as an educational part of your journey through life because once

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,240
you hear this song you'll never ever be able to forget this moment in time

64
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,360
that we share together. I have to big song and answer say it's illegal that I'm

65
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,200
playing it technically but if you go to iTunes go ahead and buy it because you

66
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,520
like it. Chris Rhea thinks the best of album. And let me tell you stuff that

67
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:29,000
gets played here on the Charlie cells. Got a note from Blake Morgan through a

68
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,800
marky ocean motor and end cough that yesterday they timed it and looked at

69
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,760
everything you know his album came out. Blake member yesterday played maybe

70
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,800
MMA's the fantastic Paul McCartney cover at Blake Morgan did from engine

71
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,800
company records that went to number one on the iTunes chart for a little

72
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,360
while on Tuesday I'm sorry it was Tuesday show didn't do a show yesterday as

73
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,680
we were traveling. Awesome so and if you look at the reviews it even says

74
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,840
people say hey I heard this on the daily source code so I got into work

75
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,080
hopped and over to iTunes and bought not just the track some people bought the

76
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,840
entire album so the pod save music revolution proving once again that it

77
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,000
really does work. How do you like the ambient noise there of the beach at

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,080
the ocean we are on the ocean here on fire island which is right off of I

79
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,800
guess it's technically a part of Long Island New York listen to that man of

80
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,440
course I have a little ambient help there let me just see I can turn the beach

81
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,040
down I can turn the beach up and down it's fantastic so we had a nice flight

82
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,520
from from the UK actually there was a it was a little messed up because

83
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,120
there was I don't know if you've been following the news but there are

84
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,880
protesters at Heathrow who are causing a bit of commotion and slowing

85
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,600
stuff down because well two things I believe one part of the group I

86
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,960
doesn't want the third runway open at Heathrow good luck on stopping that

87
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,800
in the other group wants to stop aviation in general because it affects

88
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,880
climate change and so that did make our early early morning commute to the

89
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,280
airport a little bit slower than normal of course the tickets had screwed up

90
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,480
Patricia still has her maiden name in her passport so it was interesting trying

91
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,880
to prove that she was indeed a curry that was fun and then as we were going

92
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,960
through the fast track it was like someone didn't have their weedies that

93
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,640
morning and they said excuse me excuse me sir come here your bag looks like it won't

94
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,840
fit in this rack I'm like oh but who cares I've been with this bag through

95
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:35,080
the fast track 20 times since I bought this particular roller bag we don't

96
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,560
care Santa plenty and of course the wheels I mean they show me this ridiculously

97
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:46,320
small rack you know that nothing could really fit into and it didn't fit and I

98
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,320
said but you know what differences it make it's virgins decision you know what

99
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,320
is the danger in my bag being like three centimeters too large well that

100
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,920
of course was not the right thing to say so I wound up having to check that

101
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,720
bag very interesting sir this is British airports this is not virgin airlines

102
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,840
that's suck my my wanker I've really got to learn to relax a little bit

103
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,200
more while while we were in the air phone calls kept coming in

104
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,080
so I don't it's only pod show if you've broken come access my site the

105
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,760
gaming show dot pod show dot com just giving seven not found it's all broken

106
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:36,720
again I don't know let's help pod show suck less there you go yeah it's all

107
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,160
broken now what's going on and this has actually been a source I think of some

108
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:48,160
complications over the past two weeks we have optimized our entire site I

109
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,040
believe it's now worldwide and essentially we're still in some form of a proof

110
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,280
of concept phase but you can't really test any other way than just turning it

111
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,920
on and seeing if it works because the choices literally between doing this

112
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,640
optimization or building data centers around the world or replicating data

113
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,760
around the world and so far I think the the speed has really really been good

114
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,360
it seems like there is a significant improvement in accessing it from the UK

115
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:25,520
in fact here for actually sent me a little a little note the other day let's see

116
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,040
here's what they've been doing they migrated a whole bunch of blogs including

117
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,440
mine to a new server integrated akami caching to speed up the BT pod show site

118
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,640
for the UK started ultra DNS for BT pod show to increase UK speed finalized

119
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,280
penetration testing oh man how come never never calls me for the penetration

120
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,400
testing and they're applying fixes to secure all properties preparing secure

121
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,440
storing of database crap to turn the Twitter module for show we're going to

122
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,840
get a Twitter module for show private profiles interesting and a lot more okay

123
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,520
so awesome that the guys are all doing that and that's part of the problems

124
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,160
you're seeing I think it's also part of some of the password issues that we've

125
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,160
seen where web stuff isn't being replicated in a timely fashion so apologies

126
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,160
people really are working around the clock to get this right so I'm glad

127
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,160
I don't have to really deal with it although I'm technically I'm on vacation

128
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,640
I certainly am on a lot of email and going through a lot of stuff so we got

129
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,840
to the let's see ride the JFK that I went smoothly nice flight by the way

130
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,320
saw blades of glory on the airplane laughed out loud several times luckily

131
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,080
it wasn't a night a night flight I'm sure I would have woken people up and then

132
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,440
we took well the virgin limo then took us to I love that the virgin limo took us to

133
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,760
saveil New York which is out in Long Island I think it's quite right off the

134
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,920
Montag Highway but an hour and ten minutes from the airport and then we got on

135
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,880
the fire island ferry and boy is that a ferry boat let me tell you if you don't

136
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:04,040
know anything about fire island in a long island then you need to Google

137
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,120
that I'll see if I can find some links it has a very interesting history back

138
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,640
from the wailing days in the 1600s and well quite honestly it's really a

139
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,040
a hideaway spot that I just don't know if a lot of people know about it there's

140
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,880
something like 640 homes here many of them really majorly massively

141
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,880
expensive and beautiful and and somewhere on the base side somewhere on the

142
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,000
ocean side we've got a house actually the belongs to New York state judge who's

143
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,440
renting it out to us for for the period that we're here it's right on the beach

144
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,440
it's four bedrooms I mean it's a it's a real beach house in fact it

145
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,920
reminds me a lot of kind of like what a Malibu beach house experiences

146
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,320
it's a different in architecture across the board but it's really nice in the

147
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,360
this morning if you as maybe you saw the pictures on curie dot com

148
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,560
a family of three deer walked right up onto the dunes I'm sure they're you know

149
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,000
they're on this island and they're quite tame and they used to being fed but still

150
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,920
it was quite spectacular to just have them walk up to the to the deck and just say

151
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,480
hi and we gave them an apple or two and I know the girls were feeding them bread and

152
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,480
shit like stop man you might I want to do that and they might when

153
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,080
come back and rehab it I got to get the I got to get the back story on that but fire

154
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:24,440
island is um it's an incredible place it is so laid back there is no you know no

155
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:31,240
formal dress code anywhere on the island for any restaurants or anywhere you go it's uh

156
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,960
it's nice man it's just uh it's come yeah it's it's really nice people say hi to each other

157
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,400
when you're walking on the boardwalk and it's relaxed it really is so uh I'm sure that

158
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,280
the lady Patricia will join me for a show either maybe tomorrow but certainly next week

159
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,000
and we'll talk more about our experiences here but do you have a couple of things

160
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,880
I need to catch up on so we'll do some phone calls right after this

161
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,720
I this is Michelle from whisper pearls do you like it when a girl talks dirty in your air

162
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:06,120
do you wish that I would do that more well here's your chance I'm starting my very first

167
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:41,800
week hey Adam it's been in California actually specifically I live out in the desert in California

168
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:48,600
and I've been listening to the DSC uh 651 you made a comment about the horizontal rain flying

169
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,640
pasture window and you're asking like man where's the heat none where's the heat and I'm kind

170
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,680
of asking the same question I'm living out here in the desert for the past I don't know almost the

171
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:08,600
18 years we've had three of the mildest summers that I can remember um this is August and uh we

172
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:15,000
haven't hit 120 yet in fact the last two or three years we've only hit maybe one or two days at 120

173
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,160
it may sound hot to you guys but see anything under a hundred and fifteen is great out here yeah I

174
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,920
got to tell you um almost like close your ears let me just see if I can turn up the volume there I'm

175
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,840
still figuring out all the uh I'm figuring it out everything I can do here to crank up uh maximum

176
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,840
volume for these calls yeah it's uh it's not nice today I mean the weather is completely acceptable

177
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:46,040
because it's uh well it's like 75 degrees but it's been overcast all day there is no sun you know

178
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,640
I could use a little bit of global warming right now so I can understand where you know

179
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:56,120
having only a hundred degrees instead of 120 you must be really upset. The only big change that I

180
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,200
seen as far as the global warming thing goes is uh yeah we've caused something to change it you've got

181
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:08,840
150 eight all courses in the excel of LA right now with probably 30 in planning in an

182
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,880
under construction and uh it's a little humid I mean when you're spraying that much water into

183
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,600
the air in a smaller area yeah you're gonna change the way the whole climate uh feels and everything

184
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:27,960
and it's doing it but uh the global warming and that's so much well I'll keep unfolding and I'll

185
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:35,640
talk to you later thanks uh I'm in thank you you know it's interesting when I was and again thanks

186
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,840
the chef Mark for hooking me up he definitely was the direct connection to us getting this place so when

187
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:48,600
I spoke to the the agent uh responsible for for renting it out I said you know um real deal breaker is

188
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,320
internet and and preferably Wi-Fi I mean if you don't have Wi-Fi let me know now if it's not if it's a

189
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,600
wired connection I'll bring uh you know wireless hub along and they said no no don't worry there will

190
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:07,480
be internet in the house and there is uh by the way uh and it's pretty good it's connected to uh they

191
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,960
they really only have I think one or I don't know how they don't have a lot of connections

192
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,040
on this island I think probably the cable company is providing it but what's really cool is there's

193
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,920
this outfit called I think it's barrier reef I think is what it's called hold on a second I have it here

194
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:33,480
uh barrier free I'm sorry barrier free and they have uh blanket coverage all over the island

195
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:39,480
and I was doing a little bit of research on them um because uh excuse me uh back to school

196
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,880
kmart dot com back to school dot patcho dot com so I'm doing a little bit of research looking at

197
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,240
what kind of offering they have and it turns out they've got a meshed Wi-Fi network across the

198
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,280
island and you can see all of the little access points on these different homes it's really incredible

199
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,200
these guys have a mesh network that is actually working now it does have its flaws because uh you

200
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,600
know depending on who's downloading porn at any given moment it will affect the rest of the network

201
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,320
but you still get a good like you know I'd say 700 kilobit per second uh on the on the download side

202
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,680
and sometimes it burst up to two or three megabits per second uh but it's just awesome to see that

203
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,600
this community um has gone ahead and done that so now you can get a homeowner's pass you can get a

204
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,000
daily pass weekly pass or a monthly pass and anywhere you go on the island um you essentially can

205
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,280
log right in and which of course is great for the iPhone and the people that are here let me tell you

206
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,640
they got lots of beautiful cell phones okay Steve it's time for your podcast this week if you

207
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:44,040

208
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,680

209
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:58,280
and what if I refuse to do it what if I get a new host and what if you would not just get right

210
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:06,680
down to it and do this little beauty yeah go ahead thought yeah forgive me Adam Curry wherever you are

211

of the muppets and the gem hints and company hmm found in iTunes and at muppetcast.com all right

213
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,920
awful I hated it worthless grandma I was just a new old guys you know what I mean

214
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,480
um hey let's see we got I was waiting for this phone call to come in I was grinning from ear to ear

215
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,960
when Sam called me to follow up on the exploding Nokia cell phones hey Adam it's Sam here from London

216
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,520
I'm just listening to the DSC 65 one and how do you play my comment again I forget my

217
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:54,520
that my son's Nokia phone with the exploding battery um I saw the news release on the big

218
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:02,280
website about Nokia's press release and about the battery recall of a red troll of that and

219
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:11,160
it was the the BL5C battery that was in my friend's phone blew up I knew I should have the Nokia 62

220
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,680
5 which uses that battery yeah you see that was it I knew it this was the

221
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:23,480
Nokia said that it was possible the battery could quote dislodge in this case you might want to go back to

222
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:30,440
650 was it 651 and you could hear that it was more than a little dislodging it actually exploded

223
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:37,880
out popped across the room and burned a hole in the carpet yeah I think well it's great stuff

224
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:45,480
I'm really pleased that the DSC possibly had play in getting batteries recall I am a little

225
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,800
pissed that Nokia have relied in this statement saying that there was no reports of personal

226
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:58,520
injury or property damage because my friend's property was damaged by the battery it's at five

227
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:05,800
of the carpet but you know battery recalls a good thing hopefully this will stop it happening again so

228
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:14,280
good skills keep up the good work have fun in fire I'm and I saw a catchy thing yeah it is nice

229
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,400
alright Sam thank you and I have to say I did get an email back from a Nokia apparently your

230
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:27,160
friend never did send the phone and the battery off to to Nokia so they officially don't really know

231
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,040
that it was you know the that type of battery etc maybe they did send it off I don't know but that's

232
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:39,080
the word I got back and I have to say as as recalls go and as you know basically as quickly as

233
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:46,120
this all went just going back to me I think Nokia did a very commendable job of of setting up that

234
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,120
recall and I guess that when you're doing crisis management like that and you're recalling 46 million

235
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:59,560
batteries you know you you're bound to to just make the information as complete as possible and

236
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,200
just move on with it and not dwell too much on you know stuff that's exploding and burning holes

237
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,680
in carpets because that is not what what you want to hear and that you know because if that gets

238
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,560
out to the news media oh man can you just imagine that he just imagine if if that story about these

239
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,120
exploding batteries you know was out there and you know NBC or whatever had grabbed it oh man

240
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:27,880
it would be so horrible it really would I'm you know we have there is a television here and it

241
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,480
is hooked up to actually hooked up to what is a direct TV that's what it is and I got to tell you

242
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:40,280
American TV even after not having seen it for two months since I've been back in at the cottage

243
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:47,480
it's just it's it's pretty boring shit I got to remember to bring some kind of plop filter

244
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,960
when I'm on the road all right let me see what else do I have here stuff that came in

245
00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:02,120
Sinclair sent oh yeah there's some news about the BBC eye player and people sending me this

246
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,760
note that ISPs in the UK are threatening to to do some bandwidth shaping which means essentially

247
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,880
breaking connections and lowering the throughput on the use of the eye player and so people are saying hey you

248
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,560
know net neutrality you still think it's not an issue look at this bullshit and I'm saying no no no no no

249
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:28,120
because you know this is basically a rogue a rogue application that is that is running on these ISPs

250
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,640
networks you know unless I misunderstand how it works it is peer to peer so it's not coming directly

251
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,920
from the BBC it's basically the BBC have launched a you could you could technically call it a virus

252
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:45,640
that is eating up resources of the network outside of control of the network so the BBC is basically

253
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,320
not paying anything and I think the networks have every right to to throttle what what's happening

254
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,840
because it ruins the experience for their other users I'm a typical person who does not use bit

255
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:03,160
torrent and I just don't use any peer to peer in fact I have fired up juice a couple of times

256
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,560
but that typically it'll work one day it won't work the next day maybe that's bandwidth shaping

257
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,360
maybe it's not but you know the stuff that's coming end to end it's being paid for for instance

258
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,680
stuff that's coming from pod show that's coming through just fine because I think you have to kind of

259
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,560
play by the rules and this you know peer to peer is essentially a hack to get out of paying for

260
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,280
huge bandwidth fees and hosting fees nothing wrong with it I love it as a hack but you know

261
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,120
let's not pretend that this has anything to do with net neutrality if ISPs are going to

262
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,720
going to shape that traffic away or down or whatever actually I do know one of the guys

263
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:42,920
who's responsible for this and if you read over at slash dot the actually you know they have

264
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,880
a couple of stories there about people protesting there's a lot of things about this about this

265
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:55,320
I player from the BBC a lot of people feel that the BBC is sold out to Microsoft and that they

266
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,800
already pay for this and it should be made freely available and of course it's a travesty that

267
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:06,040
it's only available through windows and not through any other browser but to internet

268
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:12,440
explorer and and won't work on other platforms like macron linux I happen to agree with all of that

269
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,520
and you know and then from the ISP perspective you know I understand but I'm going to hook up with

270
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,160
my buddy Eric and I'll get all the load down and we'll see what's going on so that'll be in a

271
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:30,040
couple weeks when we get back let's see what are we doing time wise hmm I better move this along

272
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,040

327
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,480
the much discussed conversation slash interview with my uncle Don who is uh if you don't know

328
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,520
already is president of the Korea Society very heavily involved in the uh in the current negotiations

329
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,960
with North Korea and South Korea for that matter um but was also uh pretty high ranking in the

330
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:11,800
CIA um and was uh I think personal advisor to uh president Bush senior when he was uh vice president so

331
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,280
you can imagine I've got some uh interesting things uh well he has some interesting things to talk

332
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,520
about I've got lots of questions you know what why don't you send me your questions for Uncle Don

333
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,840
please preface them in the subject of the email to atamerpodshow.com and uh just say question

334
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,480
for Uncle Don that way I can uh can find them easily and I'll be happy to ask him all of your questions.

335
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,680
I had um uh my name's dig and I'm calling from Houston Techers and I've been at the city listener

336
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,720
since probably the one ten's one twenty something like that uh I'm a live television director

337
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:46,600
and a video editor and you've had a thread in the last couple of shows about uh the fallacies

338
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:52,920
of the BBC documentary and uh in uh six fifty-one you mentioned man versus wild you know as a

339
00:32:52,920 --> 00:33:01,080
video editor we manipulate everything picture sound even audio levels and color treatments what

340
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,480
happier just to bring about so there's nothing really true or real it seems cynical but it's true

341
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,760
and everyone's trying to put their message about the way they want to and color it the way they

342
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:19,560
need to but it kind of hit an all-time well again tonight on the nightly news with Brian Williams

343
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:27,560
on NBC then he pointed out that a shot in the story about claiming the North Pole had a shot of

344
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:35,560
the sudden Russian submarine planting a flag on the bottom of the sea claiming territory in the North

345
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:42,680
Pole and a thirteen year old kid and then recognized the shot as being from the movie Titanic

346
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:50,360
so even uh routers news services distributing false images and all the news media outlets

347
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,520
picking up and running with it and uh there you go there's your red bill red pill blue pill moment

348
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:02,040
so help you enjoy your vacation and keep up the great work thanks no dude thank you so much for

349
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,160
calling this in um yeah that doesn't surprise me I gotta tell you if I wasn't on vacation right

350
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,640
now I would probably dive into that I did uh Google it and look for a couple of links and somewhere

351
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,320
so it apparently is true that well we know that the Russians are trying to plant a flag

352
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,960
up near the North Pole so that they can claim that that's actually part of their continental

353
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,360
what you call a plateau or whatever and so all the oil there is theirs and then you go of course

354
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:34,040
nightly news shows a shot of uh of Russians planting a flag on it and it turns out it's actually

355
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,000
a scene from the movie Titanic and of course it's because we all want to be

356
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:45,240
Cecil B. Demil we all want to be Steven Spielberg we all want to fill it up we have to put the

357
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,400
pretty pictures to the words we use anything that we can get anything we can get our hands on I say

358
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:55,160
this as a broadcast professional it's what we do you know and we don't even think about what the

359
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,880
what the implications are my fox does this all the time fox news they'll be doing a story about

360
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,920
anything anything they'll have continuous footage running there used to be a lot I don't know if

361
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:10,040
they still do it there used to be a law where you literally had to have file footage in the

362
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,840
lower right hand corner and and a lot of times I'll see fox talking about the war and so they have

363
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,040
a conversation there's probably the they switch off between the host and the and a person who's

364
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,800
being interviewed on a left-hand side of the screen or maybe in the corner you'll have just

365
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,280
continuous battles raging on it's all file footage you know and it really it really gives you

366
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,560
quite a in a way a false perspective of of what's going on here's another example I was watching

367
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:41,160
a great show by the way what's it the power of 10 drew carry hosts that show and it's very much like

368
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:48,360
a kind of like who wants to be a millionaire meets I don't know it's like yeah you got to guess

369
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:54,680
percentages based upon a telephonic survey poll and so what was really interesting and of course

370
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,960
let's just presume that they have a really good sample size and they're calling people from all

371
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,360
over the U.S. and so these questions have some real validity to the percentages and answers that

372
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,600
so the question I think yesterday was by the way posed to a candidate who was just stunningly

373
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,920
beautiful from Alabama and I saw them bell the question was what percentage of Americans have

374
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,640
skipped a mortgage payment now if you've been following the news you've probably read a lot

375
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,800
about this huge collapse of of the mortgages the hedge funds that own all these all these mortgages

376
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,560
that are pretty much worthless and now it's a real serious problem let me just not put that aside

377
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,400
okay and if you look at the dollar versus the euro I mean shit man it's like the dollar is

378
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,600
almost toilet paper at this point I can't even blame Patricia for scrunching her money because

379
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,800
you might as well wipe your butt with it it's really really a major problem however from the news

380
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,600
media you'd think that the whole country is defaulting on their mortgages the actual percentage of

381
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,560
people who have according to this poll and by the way the contestants also went very high like between

382
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,160
40 and 170 percent you know like this is oh this is such a huge problem the actual number turned out to be

383
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:08,200
6 percent which is obviously still incredibly high but it's nowhere near the hype that the new story

384
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,800
has kind of embedded into our minds so just remember take your red pills in the morning my friends

385
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:23,720
because they had all that bad or is it we do what we need we do what we can you mean not all is a

386
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:37,560
great with the plan we try to walk straight we try to stay true jog it all up to faith if you have to

387
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:50,840
whatever you say if it works for you have it your way if it pulls you through

388
00:37:51,720 --> 00:38:06,280
have a nice day have a nice day have a nice day and I'll have a nice day too

389
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:27,400
you do what you like you love what you do whatever excites you kill us the blues

390
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:40,520
just do what you choose and as you have a good time keep on your toes stay off of mine

391
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:52,280
whatever you say if it works for you have it your way if it pulls you through

392
00:38:52,280 --> 00:39:07,720
have a nice day have a nice day have a nice day and I'll have a nice day too

393
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:21,400
whatever you say if it works for you have it your way if it pulls you through

394
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:36,440
have a nice day have a nice day have a nice day and I'll have a nice day too

395
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,640
got to tell you I'm really happy with the pod save music I've got on my hard drive because we only

396
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:53,480
