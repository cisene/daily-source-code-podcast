1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 527

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Interestingly, there's a small price back hit

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Since I remember correctly the number is low

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That pickup front to the manufacturer

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now I'll just get over it

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,240
Why do I miss this instrument

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,000
The carriers, these are Gabriel and Eccord

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,040
A shouts all together

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
One more, two more!

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,000
One more!

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm calling the mixer

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
Fails all around.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,000
I've heard that's me

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,700
Whiled for the deals

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,300
I like just as you were 7pm little late in the night

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,900
So I'm going to a place we get to dinner right quick

20
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,800
Holding doors, coming in full of the chair

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,900
When she sits in the conversations who likes at Morris and a gym

22
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,100
And I'm mentioning that I rips

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,200
She knows who I am

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,700
And I'm flat in cotton hair

25
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,900
I'm going to know who I am

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,100
I'm not even my ma, maybe not even my dance

27
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,500
So I compose myself for people my ego and check

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,900
Cause I'm having the time of my life

29
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,300
And it's barely starting yet, so give her a kiss

30
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,300
This is my cup of beer

31
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,300
I'm out of juice

32
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,300
And you like me, so let's have a little cup of water

33
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,300
We're up here to catch the two of you

34
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,300
You're out of juice, you're out of juice

35
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,300
You're out of juice, you're out of juice

36
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,300
You're out of juice, you're out of juice

37
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,300
And you like me, so let's have a little cup of water

38
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,300
So we live the cafe and take a walk down the beach

39
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,300
A little ice cream as we walk talk the tide

40
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,300
What's the theme?

41
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,300
To joke it around

42
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,300
We're in a brain and the same thing

43
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,300
So we're first grade

44
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,300
I feel like a kid again

45
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,300
She looks at me as miles

46
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
And I smile too

47
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,300
My heart's a kid, I'm a rink and naked

48
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,300
They can naked do

49
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,300
I love you in the morning

50
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,300
And in the afternoon

51
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,300
And on the beach it's sunset and underneath

52
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,300
The moon

53
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,300
The moon is not quite right

54
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,300
So I don't make my moves

55
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,300
We're walking home laughing

56
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,300
She decides to wear my shoes

57
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,300
We're out of front porch

58
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,300
And I'm looking for a sign

59
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,300
And she's playing hard to get

60
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,300
So maybe I'll stick my time

61
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,300
I look into her eyes

62
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,300
And I want to shoot that

63
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,300
I just give her a kiss

64
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
Just make her to bed for me

65
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
And I'm a new

66
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,300
And you like me

67
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,300
So let's go

68
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Let's go

69
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,300
Make her party

70
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
Will let me

71
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,300
To rock the world

72
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
And I want to do it

73
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
Go

74
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Just make her to do it

75
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Yes

76
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,300
Yeah

77
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Just make her to bed

78
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
Bye

79
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,300
So I'm leaning closely

80
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,300
Opened she won't back away

81
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,300
And I'm leaning a little closer

82
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,300
And she takes my breath away

83
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,300
I burn away

84
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,300
Slowly

85
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,300
First kiss in the way

86
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,300
I'm knowing like the bowl

87
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,300
And we're walking on those

88
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,300
Where it's going

89
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,300
A reach for hand

90
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
Open mind doesn't shake

91
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,300
I'm nervous to sound

92
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,300
So maybe that'll have to wait

93
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
But the butterflies inside

94
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,300
I'll run my fingers through her head

95
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,300
Brush it out for more hours

96
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,300
And tuck it back behind her head

97
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,300
The tent is kinda mom

98
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,300
And then your mind is really running

99
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,300
And she's looking at you

100
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,300
On a man you gotta say so

101
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,300
So you tell her

102
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,300
She's beautiful

103
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
But it's never right for her

104
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,300
Because she's gorgeous

105
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,300
Only sex is so much more than just the word

106
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,300
She leads a little closer

107
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,300
If she understands the word

108
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,800
She never stands

109
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,300
Who needs words

110
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,300
She whispers

111
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,300
We can make our consent

112
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,300
I miss it

113
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
When I miss it

114
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
When I miss it

115
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,300
You love me

116
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,300
You love me

117
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,300
You hide me

118
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,300
You love me

119
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,300
You love me

120
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,300
And you dislike me

121
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,300
When I miss it

122
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,300
When I miss it

123
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Afterwards

124
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,300
They say it's the Sickest Sound

125
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,300
To Evercome From the Dorm Room

126
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,000
Well

127
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,300
It's from Illinois

128
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,300
For ourSad Boys

129
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,300
Let's have a little makeup party

130
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,740
party you can find that on the pod save music network um obviously there's some bits

131
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,460
in there that I recognize from a former celebrity big brother house made I think there's

132
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,740
a little bit of Leo Sayer in there you make me feel like dancing but uh I need to hear

133
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,500
no there it's a jam everybody how you doing this is daily source code episode 527 coming

134
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,900
to you from curry compound the curry compound I'm trying it out I'm just trying out different

135
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,220
names for size uh Scott uh sent that one and he said try the curry compound for a new name because

136
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:11,580
we've had curry kasa curry crib uh camp curry curry compound yeah curry cottage still has the

137
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,540
the real representation of of what this place is like although it's bigger than the other cottage

138
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,460
and the other cottage was the cottage you know what I'm saying anyway we got so much to do today

139
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,020
because I can do a full blown show today tomorrow I'm traveling to San Francisco so I'll roll

140
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,460
out of best of Charlie uh early in the morning before I leave uh or maybe I'll do that late

141
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,620
tonight before I go to bed because there's always plenty of stuff to do I'm sitting in total

142
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,100
darkness except for the windows which of course do shed enough light into the uh into the third

143
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:48,540
floor catacome here um catacome on the third floor I think that is an oxymoron uh the electricians

144
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,620
are in hanging up the chandeliers uh which is uh hopefully if I'm lucky it'll just be the

145
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:01,100
lights that go out and not the actual power because if the power does fail I'll have to pause the

146
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:07,340
recording because I'm using the uh the Yamaha digital workstation for all of my routing and pre-processing

147
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,340
all that crap I think I've saved everything appropriately now so if the power does go out and come

148
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,660
back on all my settings should come back otherwise it'll be very very unhappy little podcaster

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,420
for line line and for go daddy so it's a great to have him with his shows with his own creative

177
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,540
energy uh that he does outside of what we ask him to do to have him on the network welcome my friend

178
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:17,820
today by the way marks of the first time i'm using cast blaster pro um it's in beta right now you can

179
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:24,140
find it at cast blaster dot com uh in the forums and uh i'm really i was a little wary of installing it

180
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,700
because i have all of my stuff set up and and the main differences with cast blaster pro is it gives

181
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:35,420
you a lot more slots to put stuff in so i think i have probably 30 percent at least 30 percent more

182
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:40,700
slots to to cue stuff up and so i was kind of dreading going back and rearranging everything but

183
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,540
i finally did it uh so i've got what is it one two three four five six times what i have 24

184
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:53,340
slots for jingles which is really nice for jingles and effects you know the stuff like uh and uh yeah

185
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:59,820
that stuff and then i have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven two

186
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,300
so i've and i have 24 slots for songs which and the buttons behave a little bit differently and you

187
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,580
can cue them up and stuff that's why i mentioned that uh but it has a nice big red LED simulated

188
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:16,380
read out for the amount of time uh recorded and uh i don't know if there's any other uh secret

189
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,140
stuff in here but i'm going to fool around with it but anyway the install one perfect i'm very

190
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,940
very happy with it and as you know uh cast blaster mic is working on cast blaster video and he wants

191
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:33,020
to expand the data testers group a little bit so again you'll find at the cast blaster dot com

192
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,780
forums you'll find i'll put this link in the show notes obviously uh so you can sign up to become a

193
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,340
data tester of cast blaster video it's a complete different experience if you if you're doing

194
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:48,460
anything with video if you're a vlogger or if you like to create well father rotary because using

195
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:54,780
it to put together his daily breakfast show um it's a it's very different concept then um then

196
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,660
any other application that's out there in fact it is very analogous to the way cast blaster audio works

197
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,260
you know you're doing it live in real time it's recording whatever you're doing um and uh well

198
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,660
in cast blaster audio we have a little bit of editing there but it's really it's really intended to be

199
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,780
pretty much alive on air type studio and with video exactly the same but the way it's done i think

200
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:20,220
you will love it i've had a blast messing around with it i've really had a lot of fun and once everything

201
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,460
is kind of set up here uh so probably by the time i'm back from Stanford Cisco and then give me

202
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,980
half a week uh to clean some shit up because of course this is the messiest place in the entire joint

203
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,700
when i get all that square away i'm gonna start doing some serious testing so again link to the uh

00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,180

Ecuador. Adam how are you okay i'm Pablo from Ecuador it's 2 a.m. in the morning i was just

that we've had so on from Ecuador calling um and when he said thank you for giving us strength

217
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,340
i was like what's going on in Ecuador so i went to Wikipedia which as you know i don't trust it all

218
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,260
but for this kind of stuff i figured that you know the big fact should be there it seems like a

219
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,580
like a pretty okay country i don't think there's a dictator at rule in fact uh

220
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:30,380
uh um uh oh Fredo Palazzo took his place in Romanian office uh until the presidential election 2006

221
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,660
which did not produce a conclusive winner until a runoff election election on the 26th of November

222
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:41,260
elected Raphael Correa his margin of victory 57% of the valid votes was the highest in the

223
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:50,380
Democratic period or inaugurated in 1979 after Jamie Hymie Roldos and sixthowed Duran balen

224
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,980
Oh, man, what a name that is, huh?

225
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,620
Little place there between Columbia and Peru.

226
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,340
Fantastic.

227
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,780
Well, I'm glad I'm giving you strength.

228
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,460
I'm not quite sure what kind of strength I'm giving you,

229
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,020
but you guys got any podcasts happening over there?

230
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,420
Is there something I should listen to?

231
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,660
Got to send me a promo.

232
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,060
I'd love to hear what's going on

233
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,220
in the Ecuadorian Potosphere.

234
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:20,900
1, 2, 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7,

235
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:29,140
1, 1, 2, 1, 6, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7.

236
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,980
For those of you who knew to the show,

237
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,020
you want to use that plus and the one.

238
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,660
If you're entering the phone number for the feedback lines

239
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,940
into your cell phone number,

240
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,660
because they no matter where you are, no matter what cellular system

241
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,580
and particularly no matter where you are in the world,

242
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,940
it will work, no extra codes, no necessary.

243
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,860
I just put up with the plus one in there.

244
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,660
This next caller, I'm not sure what he was thinking.

245
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,140
My call is the most incoherent thing I've ever heard.

246
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,660
Oh, thanks.

247
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,900
Give him some library.

248
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,580
I am dirt case.

249
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,540
There is number one, number one,

250
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,180
your podcast is on different times of day.

251
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,460
Don't talk, give up when it's on changing.

252
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,820
And number two, show me $5,000, number three.

253
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,620
Wait a minute.

254
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,220
Was this the guy who was my best friend?

255
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,220
And he says, I own $5 grand.

256
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,580
To govern number three, what?

257
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,380
Ha ha.

258
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,020
I've been a new year of dirt case library, child friend.

259
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:34,660
So show number 500 if it's just from all for 500.

260
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,740
And now be the one to get used.

261
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,460
All right, all right, all right, all right.

262
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,980
What?

263
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,820
Travel friend, buy library.

264
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,620
Bye.

265
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,820
Now, do you hear that at the end?

266
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,100
I think it's Mark Yoshimoto.

267
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,820
Then, cough listen.

268
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,700
What does he say at the very end?

269
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,860
Friend, buy library, bye.

270
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,340
Bye.

271
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,580
That's the way Mark Yoshimoto named cough talks.

272
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,020
I don't trust it anymore.

273
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,140
Hello.

274
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,340
Hello.

275
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,140
Hello.

276
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,180
Hello.

277
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,140
Hello.

278
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,940
Hi, I'm Tom.

279
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,380
It's Kashihye from Shushu K.

280
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,780
This is Liberty News podcast on the P.T.N.

281
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,740
A little bird tells me that you're a closet celebrity news addict.

282
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,180
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

283
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,820
We can keep it between you, me, and lady Patricia.

284
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,220
So get your comfy slippers on, scrap the gossip banks,

285
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,100
and switch your sense out on his time for a fresh brew.

286
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,900
Thanks to Pot Show Network, you can have your celebrity picks

287
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,100
with your coffee fix every week, and no one will know.

288
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,420
Hey, do you still want to borrow my filletos this weekend?

289
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,460
Huh?

290
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,260
Oops.

291
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,220
Are we still on there?

292
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,860
Don't forget to check out Shushu K. Pot Show.com.

293
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,980
See you later.

294
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,660
I'm sorry, I forgot to act in that bit.

295
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,220
It's just you, Kay.

296
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,860
It's that there's an enhanced version of the Shushu K, which is kind of cool,

297
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,580
because the pictures then rotate along with the stories.

298
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,260
Yeah, I love celebrity gossip.

299
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,060
You know that.

300
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,100
I came home.

301
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,180
So I took the train last night, of course.

302
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,180
I didn't get home until about 940, 40, and so celebrity big brother

303
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,220
was almost over.

304
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,700
Ah, man, I love that show.

305
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,740
Ah, I'm in love with Cleo.

306
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,260
Cleo was this girl.

307
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,220
Who was on the Kenny Everett Show.

308
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,660
And she said she's 44.

309
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,140
I think she's probably a little bit older now.

310
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,940
But man, she has such a beautiful personality.

311
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,100
And, you know, and enormous hooters.

312
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,940
But she has almost like a perpetual smile on her face.

313
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,380
It's this gorgeous redhead.

314
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,060
Anyway, after that though, there was this fascinating show,

315
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,300
which I'd seen promo all week long.

316
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,100
And I think it was on, I think it was on either E4 or more

317
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,700
four, can't remember which channel it was on here.

318
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,020
It was called the trial of Tony Blair.

319
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,060
And the hypothesis of this really, it blew me away.

320
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,540
If it was some great acting, some great writing.

321
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,580
The concept was it's set in the future where Tony Blair has given up the

322
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,060
prime minister ship to Gordon Brown.

323
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,100
And so he's coming into office as the prime minister of the UK.

324
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,460
And he and, and Tony and Shuri is very, is very much like a reality.

325
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,180
I mean, it's not shot like a reality show, but it's showing you

326
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,140
behind the scenes.

327
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,780
So they have to move out of number 10 downing street.

328
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,740
And you know, you see Shuri bitching and moaning in this box is everywhere.

329
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,620
And it, of course, it was very much like anyone moving.

330
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,900
So I was very much into that because that was quite realistic.

331
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,660
Now, at the same time in this future, the president of the United States

332
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,980
is Hillary Rodham Clinton.

333
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,020
And what's happening is Tony is obsessed with his legacy.

334
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,900
And he, he wants his legacy to be anything about the war in Iraq.

335
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,180
And he's, you know, he's writing his memoirs and they're, and it's, you know,

336
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,540
it's really taking the mickey to taking the piss out of Tony Blair.

337
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,980
No doubt about it.

338
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,580
I don't know the guy and I'm sure he's much nicer and much smarter than he's portrayed

339
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,820
in this particular drama piece.

340
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,940
But what was really interesting.

341
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,180
The hypothesis here was that the international community

342
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,540
through the United Nations was setting up a war crimes tribunal in the

343
00:17:53,540 --> 00:18:01,620
Hague, specifically to prosecute those who had started wars illegally upon

344
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,220
sovereign nations.

345
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,180
And of course, depending on which side of the fence you stand on,

346
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,820
you could argue that George Bush and Tony Blair are both guilty of war crimes.

347
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:17,700
And so that's the whole hypothesis of the situation is that there's only one more,

348
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:24,180
the United Kingdom can veto, can veto this, this tribunal being set up.

349
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,060
And so of course, you know, Tony Blair's own party guy, Gordon Brown, has to either veto it

350
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,820
or go ahead with it.

351
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,460
And they come up with this rules, which is really nasty.

352
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:40,100
One of Brown's advisors, they just make sure that the representative of the UN,

353
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,260
the ambassador who was supposed to vote and veto this tribunal,

354
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,820
they make him miss the vote by, you know, sitting in the bathroom and whatever it is.

355
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,460
So he misses the vote and the tribunal gets set up.

356
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,660
And then everyone turns his back on Blair.

357
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,860
The property price is crashed by 20% the minute he's out of office.

358
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,420
Yet labor votes are up by 7%.

359
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:07,860
It really is a scary scary notion if your name happens to be Tony Blair.

360
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,060
And I don't know if there's, if you're available, if it's available for viewing anywhere.

361
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,860
Excuse me, oh, I said, let's blend it up.

362
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,060
You know, I'm sitting down now.

363
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,340
That's the whole problem.

364
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,100
I want my stand up console.

365
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,300
Anyway, if your name is Tony Blair, then you should be shit and bricks.

366
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,740
I hope you can see this somewhere other than in the United Kingdom because it was really,

367
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,540
really good and well worth taking a look at.

368
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,060
Hi, Adam, it looks speaking.

369
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,780
You know, Adam, we forgot to do something last year.

370
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,180
Last year we forgot to celebrate that this might 25 year anniversary of listening to

371
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,500
Adam Kirris, crappy shows.

372
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,340
This is something I started listening to you in 1991 or something around that time.

373
00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:00,260
Well, I don't have any champagne here with me right now, but I have a nice fresh couple of Finnish coffee

374
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,460
in front of me and for this occasion I took out the president blend.

375
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,140
So Adam, stop playing with your gold-eddy, grab couple of scents,

376
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:21,460
put some splendour in it and raise your mark to another 25 years of listening to Adam Kirris crappy shows.

377
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:30,340
Okay, so thanks for the last 25 years and I look forward to many more good moments of listening to you.

378
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,620
Cheerio vibe.

379
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,060
Hey, look, that's really nice, ma'am.

380
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,900
Look from Finland.

381
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,500
That's right, if you, uh, let me think.

382
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,020
How long have I been doing this shit?

383
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:49,540
I started on radio, uh, pirate radio in Amsterdam when I was 15 or 16.

384
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,220
So that would be 24, yeah, so about 25 years. Damn.

385
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:02,740
Well, here's, I'm raising a mug of scents sale to you, my friend, and I'm very happy to hear that

386
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,420
after 25 years of indeed making crap shows and totally talking out of my ass, you're still listening.

387
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,660
I really, really appreciate it. It makes me feel good.

388
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,300
I just wanted to call the call out, uh, the Dignation Boys on, uh, on their authority.

389
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:25,460
I was catching up on some Calli Lewis Geet Brief TV episodes and I ran across this episode where,

390
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,380
what is it, uh, is it Kevin? Is that his name? From Dignation, where, um,

391
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,100
well, maybe I should have Calli Lewis explained it, but it's about the iPhone.

392
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,980
And this is before the iPhone came out and he was on his show, uh, telling everyone exactly what

393
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,220
the iPhone was going to be because, of course, you would expect Kevin Rose, right? You would expect him

394
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,420
to have all the inside dirt because he's so incredibly clued into what's going on in Silicon Valley.

395
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:59,860
Well, let's see if that's true. Have a listen. Kevin Rose from Dignation, number 74.

396
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,940
I have a little bit of insight information on the Apple phone. Okay.

397
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,220
Two batteries. Oh, two batteries. No, sorry. That's not correct. Roger.

398
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,380
One for the MP3 portion of it, and one for the phone.

399
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,740
Just say something! Two capacities for an eight gigs. Okay, that's right. I think we're talking

400
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,940
2.49 and 4.49. Like a pretty big price difference between the four eight gigs. Flash memory. Okay.

401
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:32,740
Slide out keyboard. Eeeeeey. I got keyboard. That's fancy. Anyone doing tech is gets tips.

402
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,500
But Kevin has a reputation for getting some important Apple rumors right. Okay. So there you go.

403
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:44,100
So much for the reputation. In a world where disability strikes 10% of the population.

404
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,980
Only one man has the guts to take on the powers that be and raise his voice in a challenge to

405
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:59,540
media demigagery and the tyranny of the mass market. That man is Charles Rovira and he can be heard

406
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,100
at MSBpodcast.com.

407
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:40,580
And I'm a buncher. I do my business on the throne. I'm a sitter. I'm a standard.

408
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:47,540
I'm a left-right hender. It's nice to know I'm not alone.

409
00:23:48,020 --> 00:24:01,860
Well, it's not exclusive to the US, you know. We've got scrunches and folders and all parts of the world.

410
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,860
Including the United Kingdom.

411
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:18,980
I had them. It's Chris. Analyzer. From the aircraft podcast right up here in an authorist of England.

412
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,860
And we just wanted to let you know how fired up we are to be part of the pod show family.

413
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,420
Hey, and don't forget BET pod show. Oh yeah, it was quite exciting to see how show listed in the top

414
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:35,460
pick section. So for those people that haven't heard of us, you can find us us airpodcast.podshow.com or

415
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:42,340
a podcast at BETpodshow.com. You say we couldn't make it any easier for you to visit us.

416
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:48,340
So drop by to find out what two people living very different lives talk about when they're getting to a studio.

417
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,540
Oh yeah, and we're both folders. I never said you were a folder. I did. I said to you you

418
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:57,780
fold it like that and then I'm going to fold again. No, you're more of a scrunchie. That's good.

419
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,860
Welcome guys. Great to have you on the network. Yep. It's growing. We're building. I'm very excited

420
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:10,180
about what's happening in lots of people coming up to us with very interesting ideas. So for this new year,

421
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,780
I'm going to be spending a lot more time in London. I will be shuddling back and forth between

422
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:18,420
London and San Francisco more frequently. I tend to spend a full work week in SF,

423
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,980
come back to the UK for two weeks, then go back for a week and really try and manage it that way

424
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:30,020
because it's just too much going on on either side of the pond. I got a, uh, a forward from

425
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,460
Google reader from what's, who is this from from Shayna? Who sends me a links from time to time,

426
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:41,700
which I obviously appreciate very much. And she sent me a link about the movie, Stomp, Stomp

427
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,260
the Yard, which of course, as you know, we promoted the movie, been promoting it for two weeks.

428
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,660
I told you I promised you would be the number one movie. It was number one movie opened up this weekend

429
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:56,740
over $22 million in box office receipts. But this seems to be some controversy surrounding

430
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:04,820
surrounding Stomp the Yard. And it's kind of a funny one. What's this? Is this going to fire

431
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:12,900
up some video here? I'm looking at what is this page? This is on MSMBC.com. So the movie is set in the

432
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,980
world of black fraternities and their traditional style of step dancing, which is a part of,

433
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:26,500
a lot of the part of the pledging process. And I presume that the, um, that a lot of this movie

434
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:33,460
was based around Alpha Phi Alpha. But what's interesting is that Alpha Phi Alpha did not give

435
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,540
permission to actually display their, their colors or letters or anything in the, in the film.

436
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:46,500
And a lot of Alpha Phi Alpha alumni are going to the movie, not being very disappointed. And,

437
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,580
yeah, so there's a minor controversy there. That's, I guess that's kind of good to have

438
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,180
controversy. You know what? It's much better than controversy. That's why.

439
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:00,500
I had a full coin here from Beach House to the masses. Just a little message to thank you,

440
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,780
and everyone at BT Parcho for allowing me into the network. It caps off a very successful

441
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:12,020
and exciting 2006. The Vinnie Volk in the podcast Live gigs at the Purple Turtle in Camdered.

442
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,500
And we've already secured a monthly spot there, which is very, very good for not only the bands,

443
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,420
but also for podcasting, raising the profile a little bit and getting them as recorded.

444
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:29,060
And I think it's kind of cat-off two years of podcasting to make it all very, very bizarre

445
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,700
and to start with. And only just coming into, to get into grips with what we can actually do

446
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:40,420
in this incredible medium. So, he's to a great 2007. And I'd just see you again too.

447
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,140
Bye-bye. BFM.btparcho.com.

448
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,300
Right on. And also, welcome to the network.

449
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:54,020
We've got another great show, which I believe is launching, I wonder if it launches this week

450
00:27:54,020 --> 00:28:00,740
or next week. It's a podfinder UK. We've brought the podfinder brand back and we're going to

451
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:08,340
do a video version of podfinder in the UK for UK-based podcast. Josephine is the host of that show.

452
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,340
I think you're going to love her. She's fantastic. I mean, I'm not quite sure what we found her.

453
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:18,900
She's not an actress, but she's well into, uh, well into pod casting. Hold on a second. Let me

454
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:27,060
see if I can find her, uh, her profile page. Mm-hmm. It'll be well worth it, trust me.

455
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:34,420
I'll just go to pod show and I'll search for people. I'm still on that vote of phone, uh,

456
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:40,660
the vote of phone, quasi-broadband modem. It's doing okay. I'm still definitely afraid. I'm going to

457
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:47,700
go over my allotted one gig limit before the month is up. Thank God I'm going to San Francisco.

458
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,260
You know, I've already checked all the machines. Make sure that there's no automatic system updates

459
00:28:52,260 --> 00:29:00,820
that are in place. Uh, Josephine. Oops. Don't you just love it while you're

460
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:09,380
taking your time while I miss type shit. Okay. Click on Josephine, search under people,

461
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:16,980
and there we go. Josephine. Okay. What's her pod show? Plus you are, uh, Josephine Lawrence. Okay.

462
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,780
That makes sense. Josephine Lawrence dot BT pod show dot com. Or Josephine Lawrence dot dot dot dot

463
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:27,940
pod show dot com. And, uh, and you'll find a link there to pod finder UK with as let me see if

464
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,460
it's on the area. Is it on the air? See if the first episode is up, which is pod finder UK dot

465
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:40,980
BT pod show dot com. But check out Josephine met. She's awesome. Uh, no, does not have any episodes yet.

466
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,500
So, but I can already see this stuff that's featured. Okay. You'll like it. Episode one coming

467
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,340
up today, I think, or it should be up before the weekend. No doubt about it. Uh, why was I telling

468
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:58,500
you that? Uh, oh, the reason was because, uh, she all does she feature in the attic. I'm not sure

469
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,380
doesn't even feature the show. Well, anyway, so in the attic, I've talked about the show before,

470
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:11,460
which is, um, Rachel Fuller, uh, it's her concept. Uh, she is, uh, long term long time, long term.

471
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,900
I hope she's long term. Long time girlfriend of P. Townsend of the who. And, uh, while on tour,

472
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,540
she had an air stream trailer completely kidded out and she would sit in the back and do interviews

473
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:29,300
with bands. And we've had some pretty good ones. Magic numbers, Zutons, uh, Krike. I can't

474
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:35,220
even remember all of them. But all top notch bands and Pete will come in and jam with them. And then

475
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,020
sometimes, uh, in fact, I think there's an acoustic jam of Michael Jackson's Billy Jean in the

476
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:46,740
episode number seven, which is also going up this week. And whenever possible, Rachel, who is a

477
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:52,660
performer in her own right, she'll do a song. And, um, in, in this most recent episode,

478
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,100
see, this is a little, I'm playing this directly from the video. She does this beautiful song,

479
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:03,380
uh, acoustic, she's sitting behind electric piano in the air stream trailer. And the song just

480
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:11,140
blew me away. Her vocals, fantastic. It's almost angelic. This is Rachel Fuller on the daily source

481
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:28,500
clip. Check all the rooms to see if you're home. And I close all the doors, because if I'm alone,

482
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:39,620
I can't fly. And nobody knows this secret is mine. When I fly,

483
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:54,820
my happiness shows all at the same time. You wouldn't believe the wonder of me.

484
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:03,940
Would you see how light is my heart, how wild and how free,

485
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:15,460
when I fly, from heaven to fear, in the blink of an eye, and I can fly,

486
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:28,020
there's space in through time, and everything's fine, in my sky, invisible wings,

487
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:41,380
and possible high when I fly. And nobody knows this secret is mine. I can fly,

488
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:50,660
my happiness shows all at the same time. If there's a place,

489
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:59,620
we're lonely in the streets, this angel will fall, without faith,

490
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:14,740
how can there be grace, but until then, I will fly. And nobody knows this secret is mine.

491
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:27,780
When I fly, my happiness shows all at the same time.

492
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:45,540
God is not beautiful. Oh, was this the end of the show?

493
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:56,580
I do hope you enjoyed. Oh, I'm in love with her. What a voice. Let me just just see if I can

494
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:04,980
find that piece, it was with the foi vans, is that who it was? I think it's foi vans, yeah,

495
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,900
home on second. We find the Billy Jean bit. You're going to dig this. It was here it is, home on.

496
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,260
Are you have to listen to this? Totally not pod save, but it's so fucking cool.

497
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:25,060
So it's Simon, Pete's brother, Rachel, and foi vans, and check this out.

498
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:35,540
People always told me, leave care for what you do, you can't go wrong,

499
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:48,100
breaking young girls' hearts, but she's still right by me, and I smell her perfume.

500
00:34:49,060 --> 00:35:03,380
Started to consume her, she let me to her room, and all I love was, but that she was never my love.

501
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:21,380
She's just a girl who claims that I am her world, but the kid isn't like a boss.

502
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:37,380
Oh, I'm in love with her, I'm in love with her, I'm in love with her, I'm in love with her,

503
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:53,380

505
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:09,380

506
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:15,380

511
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,400
