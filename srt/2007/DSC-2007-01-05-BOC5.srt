00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hi everybody. How you doing? It's Adam here at the Curry Cottage, and of course the

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,040
affluent suburb of Serino and his Guilford still on the east side of town. As we're

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,640
in the middle of the big move of 2007, and I've got another best of Charlie lined up for

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,440
you today. That's what we've been filling the feed with for this past week and we'll do

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,040
so for next week as well. Listeners, fans, other podcasts have been so incredibly kind

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,560
of putting together these shows that I call the best of Charlie. Essentially, a highlights

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,600
of previous shows that anyone who wants to put together a show like, and they're really

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,640
interesting montages. It's very, very cool to hear what people find relevant, interesting,

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,760
funny, intriguing it. By the way, you hear that in the background. It's the last time you're

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,960
going to, or one of the last times you're going to hear that. That's the garbage guys backing up

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,400
the truck again. I wonder, I don't even know what the garbage schedule is at the new place.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,120
Anyway, things are a little bit tense around the Cottage. Patricia definitely does not,

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,240
does not like a mess. She's very organized, as I'm sure you can tell from her personality.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,920
The thing she really doesn't like is when she's cleaning stuff up and other people make a mess

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,400
around her. That wouldn't be me that would be more the teenager that is making the mess.

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,920
Somehow, I seem to get the brunt of the fallout, though. There you go. It's the glass, man.

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,480
It's okay, though. Things are going quite smoothly. Thank you, several people who emailed

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,840
it and said that the vote of phone, wireless broadband, USB-Dongol is actually a pretty darn good

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,880
solution, and we'll probably work out just fine for me for the week or maybe two weeks that

20
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:54,080
will be without broadband in the new place. Nothing new to mention about big brother. Other than that,

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,160
I was of course completely wrong about Dark Benedict. I'm not even going to get into it now,

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,480
but I thought he was in battle-star Galactica. No, it wasn't that. It wasn't that. It wasn't

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,240
that shit. Hold on a second. I'll look it up, because you know who, of course, emailed me.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,640
Brittany Mason. She always knows exactly what's going on. Hold on.

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:24,000
Here we go. Dark Benedict. He was star-buck on battle-star Galactica. Not buck Rogers. There you go.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,600
That was Jill Gerard. Okay. Thank you, Brittany. I knew you'd set me straight, girl.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,480
But yeah, nothing really happened of any importance. I'm very intrigued about your main

28
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,040
jacks, and I can't wait to find out more about this guy and what he's like other than the

29
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,200
two times I've met him. We're seeing very sweet, very nice, very personal, actually a little bit shy.

30
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,480
Of course, he's got a lot of the Michael Jackson freak juice sprayed all over him, so we'll see how

31
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,520
that turns out. Anyway, oh, by the way, I got my my tax disc squared away. After all that,

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,720
after all that bullshit turns out I was able to do it right online through direct.gov.uk slash

33
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:18,240
tax disc. I was done in like four minutes. Today's best of Charlie is done as produced by Chris

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:25,360
Daily, a host of the Pod Music Countdown, the PMC Top 10. I put together a very cool show,

35
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,720
despite that he was definitely under the weather. He'll tell you all about that.

36
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,120
So thank you with advance Chris. And of course, I do want to remind you that great deals on

37
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,640

38
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,280

39
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,320
movie, stop the yard, which opens up on January 12th. It's going to be a major smash.

40
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,520
Okay, I'm pretty sure I'm going to check in over the weekend as well, even though there may not

41
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,160
be a best of Charlie, but I'm back to doing a lot of blogging. You might want to check out

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,520
Curry.com, which soon I hope to actually switch over to the new blogging platform at Pod Show,

43
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,680
which has not been entirely released, but if you check it out now, you'll see that already. We have

44
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,880
a pretty cool editor and some new stuff in there. And I'm already rambling on much, much, much longer

45
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,840
than I intended to. So enjoy. Today's best of Charlie number five, and I'll talk to you guys

46
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:34,080
over the weekend. Bye. Well, hold on a second. I suck. Okay, it was just a new setup. Here we go.

47
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
Boc number five. Enjoy everybody.

48
00:04:49,840 --> 00:05:05,600
Hey, welcome back to the PMC Top 10. Wait a minute. This isn't the pod music countdown.

49
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,920
Daily source code. In fact, it's a best of Charlie episode hosted by yours truly the

50
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,280
C dog Chris daily. And if I seem to have a little bit more berry white in my voice right now,

51
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,880
it's because I woke up with some serious throat issues. I think and strip throat or something coming

52
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,160
on. But hey, I promised Adam I would get this show. So hey, I'm going to do it, man. I just took a

53
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,040
big swig at this bucklies cough syrup. And let me tell you that stuff is horrible. But I said I'm going

54
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,280
to deliver. So I'm going to. You see Adam, you see what I do for you? Now, most of you know that I host

55
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,840
the official countdown show of the pod safe music scene, the PMC Top 10. Each week I count down the

56
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,760
top 10 songs being spun by podcasters all over the planet. While my staff is busy compiling

57
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,520
stats from all the great music sources like the pod safe music network. I owed a magnitune,

58
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,960
pod safe audio.com, garage band, and many more. I get the very, very cool task of listening

59
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,360
to the great music podcast. You know the ones, those influential podcasters that helped determine

60
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,600
the success of some of these great indie artists. No list of influential music podcasters would

61
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,440
be complete without the podfather Adam Curry. Whether he's breaking songs to the public for the

62
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:46,720
very first time or just pumping the great stuff. He hears on other music pod guests. His DSC plays

63
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,000
a big part in the drama we call pod safe music. One of the artists that benefited greatly from Adam's

64
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,200
Pampage was Howard Jones. This is from the October 23rd, DSC. Found the Howard Jones is on the pod

65
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,960
tech music network. Howard Jones, of course, have been playing his records ever since I was 19.

66
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,240
And looking at the picture of him on the pod safe music network. He's lost a lot of hair since

67
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,720
then. It's like receded all the way back. But it's great. And there's a little blurb up here.

68
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,760
He has released one track, which he put up yesterday, released for podcasters to promote the

69
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,400
forthcoming UK hitmakers tour with ABC and Toya, a world tourist to follow in 2007.

70
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,200
When playing this track, please include tour details. And this link. Oh, hold on. podcast live.

71
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,760
Oh, I see. There's, um, oh, interesting. Let's see if we can open this up. What is this link?

72
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,960
That's kind of that's an interesting way to do that to promote something on the pod save music

73
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,560
network. Hold on. This link is a little messed up. Will it fit tour dates dot pdf? Cool.

74
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,480
Oh, we have a 404 arrow at the fuck is that? And I can't be right. Hold on.

75
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:07,920
H j two or d h dot pdf. Looks like I'm, um, shy. Let me just go look at that home page.

76
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,960
I'll see if there's anything there about how our Jones tour dates.

77
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,000
Well, there's a link to podcast live dot code.uk. But there's the link that, uh, how our Jones

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,280
put in the pod save music network is not working, um, not to look into that. Okay, so we'll find

79
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,200
out what the tour dates are in the meantime. I wanted to take a listen to the song because it's,

80
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:42,000
I really liked it. It's kind of like classic Howard Jones, but modernized. Oh, no 80's

81
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,120
got just rocking, building our own future. From the pod save music network, Howard Jones,

82
00:08:49,120 --> 00:09:05,360
D.S.C. or paints 3.

83
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:35,120
So take a step in this place

84
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,120
God will accompany our own future

85
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Just roll out for a day by day

86
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,120
We need to choose a life that stands for all of us

Putting people's heads at the top

88
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,120
It's the first incitemeration

89
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Changing in the heart of just one

90
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,120
A lot of things will tighten things up

91
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Don't give it up

92
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,120
To the face of the force

93
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Around us we decide

94
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Between the end and the outside

95
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,120
So take a step in this place

96
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,120

Mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters and brothers

101
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,120
All in the middle of the way

102
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Comes in the rest of the world

103
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,120

See how tall is it, rock?

117
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Our Jones of that

118
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,120
It's a great way of producing the

119
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Kind of that snare

120
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Back

121
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Very typical for him, sounds lovely

122
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Building our own future, Howard Jones

123
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
You can find it on music.podshow.com

To the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

125
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,120
I found it, so I'll put that link into the show notes for the PDF

126
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,120
There was a little space that snuck in there accidentally

127
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Howard will be performing at the Historic Avalon Theatre

128
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Yeah, building our own future

129
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Finished up number 10 on the recently released

130
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Top Sons of 2006

131
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,120
Which can be found at www.podmusiccountdown.com

132
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,120
It's spent an amazing four weeks at number one

133
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,120
And it could have gone much longer

134
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Had it not been for the whole Christmas season

135
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Pushing everybody out

136
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
90% of everything is

137
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Krud

138
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Sturgeon's Law

139
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,120
The podcast dedicated to the 10% of everything

140
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
That isn't Krud

141
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
I want to make fast running zombies

142
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Like you see in 28 days later

143
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
The gender and biguous old and wizard

144
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,120
That's why he runs across cab drivers

145
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
And don't have shops

146
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
I like diet so much

147
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
I buy 10,000 copies at a time

148
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
In enormous hall

149
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,120
With aircraft everywhere you look

150
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,120
www.sturgeon'slaw.com

151
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
This is a different thing

152
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
It's spontaneous, it's called wit

153
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Wow, my throat is killing me

154
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
I really hope you're enjoying your vacation Adam

155
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,120
I hope it's worth it

156
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,120
One of the most popular songs

157
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,120
In the entire history of podcasting

158
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Matthew Ebel's drive away

159
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
From DSC number 370

160
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Back in April

161
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
I'm the idiot European

162
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Oh

163
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
On a day like today when you've got

164
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Sunshine breaking through the clouds

165
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Ah, there's all the driving along

166
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,120
I need some top-down driving around music

167
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
There's only one song that comes to mind

168
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
That will satisfy Matthew Ebel

169
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
And drive

170
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,120
There's a time when nothing stood in between us

171
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Now there's a curve in the world

172
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,120
So sharp it'll make you bleed

173
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,120
We don't talk with just punks to clap

174
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Can't bend each other in the same old rhythm

175
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Like maybe a little scheme

176
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
What we need

177
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,120
We love and you work like a dog

178
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Every morning

179
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
The city's a pain like the loud taste

180
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Staying on your dress

181
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Hidden the band before you raked in

182
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
And don't cost the band to leave this town

183
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
You're on the road

184
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Because we gotta get out of this mess

185
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
So let's drive away

186
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Let the sunlight chase us all day

187
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Now there's nothing going to stand in a way

188
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,120
Let's drive away

189
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
There's a word in the song

190
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,120
We're gonna took it for granted

191
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,120
But bumping the road, not really apart of the drive

192
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,120
Come on, come on, it's all right

193
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
You made me believe tonight

194
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,120
The verb makes you so damn good to be alive

195
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Oh, so let's drive away

196
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,120
Let the sunlight chase us all day

197
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,120
Now there's nothing going to stand in a way

198
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Let's drive away

199
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Drive away

200
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Drive away

201
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Sorry, but I've seen fast, but I gotta be going

202
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,120
Gotta be more than the coffee shops in the bar

203
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Lady, lady, it's still good

204
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Lady, baby, it's just me

205
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Lady, you take my hand and get in the car

206
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,120
More and more close to this town

207
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,120
And wait

208
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Let the sunlight chase us all day

209
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,120
Baby, that's all I got to find

210
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,120
I gotta say, baby, it's just me

211
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Drive away

212
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Let the sunlight chase us all day

213
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,120
Now there's nothing going to stand in a way

214
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,120
Let the sunlight chase us all day

215
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:04,120
Okay, here we are just arriving at Ferrox Airport

216
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Not too bad today

217
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120
About 30 minutes

218
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,120
Just to be expected, just a little bit of traffic on the M25

219
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,120
It's really busy here today

220
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,120
There's a thriving aviation community at this airport

221
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Alan Mann, helicopter's a station here

222
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,120
So there's always a ton of helicopter traffic

223
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,120
And there's lots of cars parked out

224
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,120
The weather's a lot quite as nice here as

225
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,120
It is near the cottage

226
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:42,120
I'll just pull up here

227
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Now with any luck

228
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,120
My request to pull the plane out of the hanger

229
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Has been granted

230
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
So let me get all my stuff

231
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
And walk over, pre flight the airplane

232
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,120
Find Jason and do some flying

233
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,120
Talk about your staying power

234
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Drive away, finished as the number four song in 2005

235
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,120
And the number 12 song of 2006

236
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,120
No other song has even come close to that

237
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,120
That is off his amazing album, Bearing Coffee

238
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
I cannot recommend that album enough

239
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,120

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,120

246

And right now you're listening to the top pod safe tunes

247
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,120
Being spun by podcasters on the PMC top 10

248
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
With my man The Seedog

249
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
Check it out

250
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,120
One of the things I really like to do on the PMC top 10

251
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
Is to promo great shows

252
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,120
It's my little way of thanking the great podcasters out there

253
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,120
That are making this revolution happen

254
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Alright, well I'm going to break from format here just a little bit

255
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,120
And I'm going to play a song that has never been in the pod music countdown

256
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
It's a song I would never get to play

257
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Because my shows carried on several terrestrial radio stations

258
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
So we've got those FCC rules and all that stuff

259
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Yeah, you know those right?

260
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Yeah, this is a song the FCC won't let me play

261
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,120
And hey Adam I have to thank you for letting me play with

262
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,120
My enormous penis

263
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Literally in every continent

264
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Ships it C tuned in

265
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,120
That's fine as long as my mother doesn't listen to that

266
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
And all the rest of the Chinese people won't understand what I'm saying

267
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,120
Here we go

268
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
Alright

269
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,120
When ever life gets you down

270
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
Keeps you wearing a frown

271
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,120
And the gravy trainers left you behind

272
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
And when you're all out of hope

273
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Down at the end of your rope

274
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,120
And nobody's there to throw you online

275
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,120
If you ever get so low that you don't know which way to go

276
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Come on and take a walk in my shoes

277
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Never worry about a thing

278
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Got the world on a string

279
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Cause I've got the cure for all of my

280
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,120
All of his blues

281
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,120
I take a look at my enormous penis

282
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,120
And my troubles start to melt away

283
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,120
I take a look at my enormous penis

284
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,120
And the happy times are coming to stay

285
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,120
I gotta sing it on dance

286
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
When I glance in my pants

287
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,120
And I've done it like a sunshiney day

288
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,120
I take a look at my enormous penis

289
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,120
And everything is going my way

290
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
I'm bummed

291
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,120
I take a look at my enormous penis

292
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,120
And my troubles start to melt away

293
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:28,120
I take a look at my enormous penis

294
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
And I've done it like a thermal scan

295
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,120
And I take a look at my enormous penis

296
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:40,120
Look at my enormous peanuts, and I have it as a comment to see.

297
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,120
Yeah, I got great big amounts in the place where it comes,

298
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,120
and the feeling like a sunshiney day.

299
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:55,120
I take a look at my enormous peanuts, and everything is going my way.

300
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,120
We're bobbing time now, everything is going my way.

301
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Hey, look at these cool birds.

302
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
Hey, everything is going my way.

303
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Hey, do I want?

304
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,120
Hey, this is going my way.

305
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Wow.

306
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
I guess there was the bobbing time machine.

307
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Nice.

308
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,120
One of the smash hits of 2006 was the band The Shakes,

309
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,120
and nothing was bigger for them than Liberty Jones.

310
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,120
It was the number four song of the year after 15 huge weeks in the chart,

311
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,120
including two at number one.

312
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,120
And since Adam overlapped Jeff Smith's satellite repair man,

313
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,120
Jingle, with the intro to the song back in this July episode,

314
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,120
you get Uncle Jesse's theme song as well.

315
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Consider it a bonus.

316
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
Alright, thank you very much.

317
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Well, of course, if you're having troubles,

318
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,120
there's only one guy who could really come down

319
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,120
to help you get your porn reception back in order.

320
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
His name is Uncle Jesse.

321
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
He's the satellite repair man.

322
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,120
He's coming after you.

323
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,120
I'm satellite repair man.

324
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
What's he gonna do?

325
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
He'll fit your missing sections,

326
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
and answer questions too.

327
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
He's nothing in the universe

328
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
and he can't move for you.

329
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
I'm satellite repair man.

330
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
What?

331
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,120
I'm satellite repair man.

332
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
Here it is.

333
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
I need your money.

334
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Heavenly Liberty Jones

335
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Works in the shop that she owns

336
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,120
Lessons to music like swing

337
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,120
When there's no customers in
