1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Well, how do everybody? Welcome to the new revamp studio here at the new Gaff. Still haven't

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,640
come up with a right name. I still kind of like the Curry Cottage have thought up a number

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:22,120
of different names. Curry quarters, camp curry, the curry crib. Nothing really strikes

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,440
my fancy yet, so looking for ideas for that. As you can tell, I've kind of got the equipment

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,200
all set up again. Hold on, I'm still rearranging everything. Yesterday, spent a shit

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,000
load of time yesterday being Sunday, Monday for those of you in Australia. Here's what

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,760
I did. You have to understand I had about 50 boxes, 5-0, 50 boxes up here in this space

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,960
that I have on the third floor, which is pretty much the length of the house, and it's

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,760
all wood floors. It's completely clean, recessed lighting. It's exactly what you'd want

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,760
for an office studio and hang out. The problem is, the stairs up to this third floor, so

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,280
narrow, that there's very little I could actually bring upstairs. Now, you know, I got the

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,720
big ugly green thing up here because the guys saw it in half for me, but I had no furniture,

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:19,520
so it was impossible for me to literally unpack stuff. So Saturday, Patricia, I had to run

14
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,040
to home base, which is an equivalent of, you know, what channel might be or home depot

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,320
in the US. And while we were looking for other generic stuff, which had to do with the

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,440
rest of the house, because of course, my portion is very unimportant. I saw a desk, one

17
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,520
of these, you know, IKEA, like, put it together, yourself things, and even though it's

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,560
a sit down model, it has exactly the right shell spaces and stacks to put a miniature

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,400
version of the studio up and at least get it running. And spent all day yesterday, putting

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:03,760
it together with the included Alan Rensch and Rensch's, I might say, with my screwdriver

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,280
and my head off, I followed the directions completely and believe me, this is not something

22
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,800
that I do a lot. Turns out I'm actually pretty good at it. It looks all right, and I also

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,320
bought a nice chair to go with it, which I also had to put together. The reason I got all

24
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,160
this stuff, I could literally throw it into the car and put it together and get something

25
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,640
up and running, because I got a lot of stuff to produce before I leave Wednesday morning

26
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,720
is when I leave for San Francisco for about 10 days. Also, I had to record with Christina,

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,320
which I was going to do last night. But you know, sometimes when you put equipment back

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,960
together, the weirdest crap happens, I'll give you one example. I had the settings,

29
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:54,160
the all the EQ and the dynamics and the compression and everything that I had at the old

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,800
cottage, I had it all set up just perfectly. And I thought I had it saved, but I hadn't.

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,440
And I'd said, you know, it's this Yamaha Alpha Whiskey 16 golf digital, who howling, you

32
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,840
can save the scene, essentially all your settings, I neglected to recall that you also

33
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,400
have to save the song data, because that is what it's attached to. And so, of course,

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,560
I spent a whole bunch of time figuring out how this fucking mix works again. And then there

35
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,720
was like a hum, and not just a little hum, it was a very noticeable, like a ground loop

36
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,800
hum. These things can be total shit to track down. So I went to like a quarter, 12 midnight

37
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:42,720
last night, I was tracking the hum. Finally found it. I had a hum or in my monitor. And

38
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm not quite sure why, but of course, the first steps to resolve that are to plug the monitor

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,920
into a different circuit on the house, which means, of course, I'll have to buy, oh, I don't

40
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,480
know, about 35 feet of extension cord to get to it. Another wall outlet that has another socket.

41
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,720
So needless to say, it's had the usual trials and tribulations of getting everything back together.

42
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,680
This, by the way, is officially a daily source code episode number 526. Sorry, I didn't mention

43
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,120
that right off the bat. I've got a best of Charlie lined up for you, because I still have the

44
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,680
vote of phone bandwidth, which, by the way, I have to say, is quite amazing. Now, of course,

45
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,400
it costs, was it 49 pounds a month, so about a hundred bucks a month. And they do say that there's

46
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,440
unlimited bandwidth with little asterix that means you can only really download about a gig.

47
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,680
So I've been very careful not to not to break the kind of the policy of downloading too much.

48
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,560
Of course, I do have to download best of Charlie's. I have to upload best of Charlie. So that is

49
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,920
definitely is eating into my budget. And Christina, of course, you know, Christina's, I mean,

50
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,760
I told it don't start up lime wire, don't do any of this other stuff, because you'll be out of

51
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,480
bandwidth. It'll be a huge problem, because, you know, of course, the broadband doesn't actually

52
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,040
arrive for another week and a half, at least. And I'm still only hoping that it'll be in by then.

53
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:18,320
Let's see. So was it Friday that the sky satellite installer was supposed to drop

54
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,800
by I can't remember if I told you the story or not. And so we were waiting, you know, he called

55
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,440
it 10 to 9, said I'll be there sometime between nine o'clock and one o'clock. And then I got a call

56
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,880
which went to voicemail, probably unfortunately, but it wouldn't have made much difference.

57
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,920
You have the driver can't find your house, which, you know, come on. This is the Beverly Hills

58
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,640
of Guilford, my friends. It's very easy to find addresses here. I mean, particularly with,

59
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,920
with UK post codes. And, you know, so anyway, so please call back. So you call back the number.

60
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,080
You go through the whole fucking menu tree. I should have recorded it. It was so ridiculous.

61
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,640
You finally wind up with the if you have an appointment today. And then you press that option.

62
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:11,200
And then the announcement says, well, you've called it a very busy time. Please call back later.

63
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,840
And then you get disconnected. So I finally wound up going through sales and then got into the

64
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,360
right support, you know, group, which I think they're all in Ireland for sky, at least it sounds

65
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,240
like they're all from Ireland. And, uh, oh, I'm sorry, sir. The installer couldn't find your house.

66
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,040
So we canceled the appointment. We have to set up a new one. You know, like, can you do it Wednesday?

67
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:41,280
So no, I can't, you know, and what is this fucking sorry excuse for, you know, that you,

68
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,520
he couldn't find the house. You know, are you a satellite company? Yes. Have you ever heard of

69
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,520
satellite navigation? I mean, it'll drop you off right in front of the house. So needless to say,

70
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,800
it didn't matter how much I pitched or moaned. I have an appointment now for the end of the month.

71
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,960
So I had to go out and get some free view boxes. This is this digital video broadcast stuff,

72
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,520
which is very successful, by the way, here in the UK. So at least we have a good clean picture

73
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,000
now on the aerial on the roof. But I was pretty annoyed that, you know, that the television,

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,400
we need our TV, we need to see big brother. So I've got that square to away.

75
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,720
Just isn't quite the way I wanted it to happen. Anyway, the vote of phone ban with just to get

76
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,840
back to that is actually pretty good. You know, I can do email quick enough. And I've set up the airport.

77
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,200
I had to do some funky routing because, you know, it's kind of funky to route through the

78
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,920
year power book, a USB network adapter. So there was some actual command line stuff I had to get into,

79
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:48,400
but I was able to set it up luckily. Now, of course, now I have to go into town and prove that I'm

80
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,440
over 18 years old to the, to the fine folks at vote of phone because they have some kind of,

81
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,800
let me say, I'll actually read it to you. If you try to go to, oh, even if you go to myspace.com.

82
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,680
So I go to myspace.com and then up pops this fine warning, which says content control restricted access.

83
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,600
You are not able to access this service because vote of phone content control is in place.

84
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,040
If you're over 18 years, you can easily remove vote of phone content control. Go to about content

85
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,880
control below for further information and details about how to remove it. And this is the fun

86
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,440
thing. So you click on about content control and then they give you all their policies, but they don't

87
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,680
actually give you a number or any way to remove that. So you wind up calling in, going through

88
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,920
another menu tree and then you have to essentially assign yourself a pin number, then you have to go to the

89
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,520
store with some kind of identification and then they'll take that off. By the way, it's not just my space

90
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:52,720
that has been blocked. Blip TV and any of the of the video sites, not BTpodshow.com, by the way.

91
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,080
Now that I've mentioned, I'm sure it can't last more than a day before that gets flagged as

92
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,520
completely inappropriate. So it's kind of interesting that they put that in from the outset.

93
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,440
Don't mention it when you order the stuff would have been nice to have known beforehand.

94
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,480
Let me see, before we get into the best of charity today, here's promo.

95
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,520
The soul of the city is playing with corruption. Every day, cops see death. But for the first time,

96
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,840
I felt it. I used to believe in justice. Now, come on the end.

97
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,080
Working with dead cops is a step, isn't it? It's so big.

98
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
You're both lucky to still have your bad eyes. I have no more of that bullshit.

99
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,720
That's fun with that important. How do you make it do it? I'm taking charge of the situation.

100
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,440
You're making a big mistake. No, I'm correcting more. I've got a clean shot.

101
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Hold it, I can take it right now.

102
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,240
Sports City PDs, the critically acclaimed police drama, made available exclusively via video podcast

103
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,840
and can be found at one place. The number one new media network podshow is at portcitypedi.podshow.com

104
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:12,640
to see the show and portcitypedi.com to join the community. Episode 5 launches January 22nd.

105
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,240
If you thought the last show was intense, you ain't seen nothing yet.

106
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,160
Yeah, I was a port citypedi brand new episode out now. You got to check it out.

107
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,040
This was the episode. I think I was supposed to be and unfortunately,

108
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,880
I couldn't make the shoot date, which I really bummed out about because

109
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,800
those guys are doing some amazing shit on an amazing budget. You have to check it out portcitypedi.podshow.com.

110
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,760
Of course, even though I am going to do it, man, I almost don't have to do a best of

111
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,800
Charlie. I've been talking so much so far. I was at 13, 14 minutes.

112
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,760
Everybody's been talking about the new iPhone and amidst all of the the big move of 2007 and

113
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,960
all the boxes. Of course, I think I read, I was in gadgets coverage, their live blog coverage.

114
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,560
I was pretty cool, actually. I think they must have had a two-man team. We just refreshed the page

115
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,720
and then there'd be a timestamp and then whatever Steve had just shown or done or whatever was

116
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,280
happening on stage and then the next time you refreshed those posts would actually have pictures in

117
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,240
them. So that was pretty damn good. And of course, I think you can download the keynote

118
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,560
from Mac world now, from the iTunes music store. Haven't done that just yet because, well,

119
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:35,280
the whole photo phone thing, right? I have to say, just looking at that phone.

120
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,240
Here's what happened to me. I'm looking at the phone and all of a sudden, and that's not a

121
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,520
drumstick hitting my cowbell, my friends. Now, of course, then the whole controversy everywhere in

122
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:57,760
the blogosphere about it being a closed box, will it actually work about it not coming out

123
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,960
until June or July? And just look, this phone looks fucking awesome. It has just about everything

124
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,240
in it that you'd want. Although I do want to say a few things about it. And particularly because

125
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:18,720
on the same day as the iPhone announcement, Nokia or Nokia came out with the the new version of

126
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:28,640
their internet tablet, the N800. And I was sent one as a gift, I'll say, not to review, but just

127
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:35,840
as a gift from Nokia. And I did want to report on what I think about this thing because it essentially

128
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,040
has kind of the same dimensions, I think, as the iPhone. Now, it's not a phone. It's an internet tablet,

129
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:50,160
which means it has it's I guess the idea is to enable all of the functions that you use the

130
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:59,120
internet for. And mainly, I almost think mainly multimedia applications in conjunction with

131
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,960
either a Wi-Fi network or with through Bluetooth with your phone. So, of course, I have the E61,

132
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,680
which I love very much, which I bought on my own, Nikol. And I've been using this device for

133
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,560
about a week now. No, less than a week. What is it? About half, yeah, four, three, four days.

134
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,640
And this is probably exactly the opposite in what would you call it?

135
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,000
It's an opposite culture that is trying to be built up around around this internet tablet. I presume

136
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:41,040
at least, because it runs on Linux. And I think it's a Debian is the flavor of Linux that it's

137
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,200
that it's running. So, there is an active developer forum. And this is essentially exactly what

138
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,880
everyone is talking about. If the iPhone is coming out, since it has OS X on it, which is also a

139
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,920
version of Unix, or that's what it's said to be running on, we'll be able to run applications

140
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,000
on it. And the answer came back, because no, absolutely not. It's a close box, and you can't do that.

141
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,200
Whatever. And so, there's a lot of people screaming and yelling. Now, if you look at the

142
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:17,760
at this internet tablet, it has some amazing things built in that were, I think some of them

143
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,320
developed by Nokia, but all all open source, all based on Debian Linux. I think they're all open

144
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,280
source, at least. You can make, there's a little camera that pops out. You can make internet-based

145
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,240
phone calls, video phone calls. I've actually tried one forks amazingly well with your presence

146
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:44,240
managed through, see, I have an account on G-talk. So, that's the, the Google chat and

147
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,400
and talk server video service or community, I am service. That's what it is.

148
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:57,760
It has a very interesting way of knowing when you are using your finger to touch the screen versus

149
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,040
the built-in stylus. I'm not a big fan of stylus. I just want to be able to touch stuff with

150
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,680
my thumbs or my fingers. And so, we'll bring up a larger version of a keyboard. This is the first

151
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,280
observation I have. Typing on any type of touch screen. I don't care if it's on the iPhone or

152
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:19,040
if it's on an internet tablet. When you actually have a screen that portrays a keyboard,

153
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,320
yeah, it could be even a full-size keyboard. It is definitely not the same thing as using a regular

154
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:33,840
keyboard or even the tacit response you get from using real keys like on the E61 on the phone that I have.

155
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,480
So, I think a lot of people may be a little bit disappointed just in general about the speed

156
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:49,120
and the re-learning you have to do to be able to type quickly and efficiently using an on-screen

157
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:59,280
keyboard because I found it reasonably difficult. Now, what's really nice about the Nokia tablet

158
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:06,960
is first of all, it works now and it has a full-fledged browser in it, which does JavaScript and they

159
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:13,840
even have a version of Flash which kind of works Flash 7. So, it doesn't work with every site.

160
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,480
Unfortunately, it doesn't work with all of Pod Show yet, at least not with the MASH board and some

161
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,680
other places where we use Flash 7. I think that they're trying to get Flash 8 licensed into it.

162
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:32,400
But if you look at the two devices side by side and I'd have to say that I'm very happy with the

163
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,640
phone that I have. I don't necessarily need to have a phone, but I love having a larger screen

164
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,000
something with audio, with video that can do all these things that connects up to, you know,

165
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,320
basically the world. I think that that's something to look at. But if I showed this to Patricia or

166
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,440
Christina, I think they'd probably cast the decide within five minutes of looking at it because

167
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,960
it no way does it reflect that fantastic interface experience that I saw on the iPhone.

168
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,680
So, you know, for all of the the back and forth thing that we're doing, look, either you buy the

169
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,920
iPhone and enjoy it, or if you're such a great developer and you want to create fantastic applications,

170
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:22,000
take a look at this. This to me seems like exactly the device the community is looking for.

171
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,400
It does Wi-Fi. It does any other, you know, any type of connection. I think it even has

172
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:37,120
an infrared. It might even have infrared. It's which is seamlessly between Wi-Fi or my 3G phone.

173
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,920
So, I don't even have to think about that. It has a streaming media player. As I said, it has the

174
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,320
full-fledged web browser. It has a personal information management, you know, I map email.

175
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,760
And of course, you can download all kinds of applications. For the geeks, it has an x-term,

176
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,080
yeah, you can drop right down into a command line and you can you're actually in a shell on this

177
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,240
device. You know, let's let's show the world that we actually can do something phenomenal. And let's

178
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,000
port some really fucking cool applications. The number one would be open office. Port open office

179
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,680
to this device and we have a huge fucking winner. It has it already has a PDF reader, but it doesn't

180
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,520
do office documents. So, you know, anyway, I'm kind of going off on a tangent here, but it's

181
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:31,760
definitely something worth looking at. Because, well, not just, I just love for some of these

182
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,760
people who are yelling so loudly about Apple creating it. Who the fuck cares what Apple does.

183
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,360
Let them do whatever they want to do. Let them sell the candy they want to sell. That's fine.

184
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,840
But everyone's saying, oh, you know, we have to be able to muck around with it bullshit.

185
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,920
Oh, my go find something that's useful that actually is out there and saying, hey, come

186
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:55,120
muck with me, please. And you can do that with this N800. I was not paid for this endorsement,

187
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:02,240
but I did receive a free thing. But I really mean it. Let me see, was anything else I wanted to

188
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:09,360
talk to you about. No, I don't think so. I think that's that's enough for right now. All right,

189
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,200
so I still have this best of Charlie. I'm trying to think what I should do now. If maybe I should

190
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,680
just leave, just leave that until tomorrow, since I've done such a phenomenal update,

191
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,920
yeah, that's what I'll do. I'll just close this down for today. We will call it a full

192
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:31,600
fledged episode daily source code 526 tomorrow. Then I will bring you, I have two more best of Charlie's

193
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,920
lined up. Of course, it was all scheduled out perfectly to the time with the with the two weeks

194
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,880
that I thought I would be off the air. And as it turns out, well, I could use two more days.

195
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,480
And then Wednesday, of course, is this travel day. So we'll be getting back into the swing of

196
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,480
things very soon. I would love for you to start calling into the voicemail numbers again.

197
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:15,360
And what I promise I'll do is I'll set up, I'll make some photos of the inside here so you can

198
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:38,960
follow along. Right on. Okay. Anything else? Yeah. I just found out Trash comes on Tuesdays.

199
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,840
We got a shit load. And everything will be kind of back to normal by midweek after I get into

200
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,240
San Francisco and we back. So get your promos coming in. Oh, I know what I had to say.

201
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,360
Remember what I told you about that movie, Stomp the Yard? It was the number one movie last week

202
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,280
and brought an over $20 million dollars. And if you want to find out more about it,

203
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,760
it's stompthepodcast.com. Costs us World Tony will talk to you all about it. He's got a couple

204
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,960
of episodes there about the movie. And it's exactly what I predicted. I told you was going to be

205
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,280
number one movie and voila. The number one movie of the weekend over 20 million bucks. Fantastic.

206
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,600
Splenda with us for another another quarter of a year. I'd love to hear more about your

207
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,800
flavour experiments. So call that into the voicemail or send me an email at him at podshow.com.

208
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,320
And of course, if you want a great deal on a domain name, check out godaddy.com. Use the checkout

209
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,960
code dsc3 for a really good deal for a year's worth of a domain name. Funness.

210
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,920
I don't know about the sound. I got to work on that. It was kind of pissing me off.

211
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,200
It's, uh, I had it so beautifully tweaked. Anyway, uh, as I said, I'll get some pictures going.

212
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,240
So you can see what it looks like. I'll put those up on the on the on the weblog at curry.com.

213
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,440
And I'll have another update tomorrow. And tomorrow I actually do this the best of Charlie. It's

214
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,920
quite a good one. I have to say, uh, from, uh, let's see who did this, uh, Tino. Tino from the

215
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,400
Netherlands did one. I think you really dig it. He dug up some some old stuff.

216
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,720
Okay, everybody. Uh, hope you don't didn't find this a waste of time since it was really just

217
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,680
about me and about my world and my diminished world and small scope of view of the past two weeks.

218
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,280
I can't wait to get back out into the real world again and get some shit done.

219
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,480
Uh, show notes at dailysourcecode.com. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Everybody. Bye. Bye. Now.
