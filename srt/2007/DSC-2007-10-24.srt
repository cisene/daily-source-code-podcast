Dalman, ladies, please allow the congressmen to finish.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll speak briefly after which I will yield the balance in my time to my honorable colleague

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
from the great state of Nirvana.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
After much deliberation, discussion, and debate,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I believe we have crafted a resolution which please is all concerned parties

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and have settled on language which is clear, concise and complete

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and I now submit for immediate consideration,

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
cross-resolution Delta Sierra Charlie 677 which in its final form states simply

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,000
fuck you at a burry.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, the winds have changed to blowing my friend.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's time to elect a president again.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'd love a spirited debate, so I'd be ready for a wait.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's get at them to get the candidate online.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Come on at them, get the message on the line.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I really want to know what this stand for.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I really want to know what they mean.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't you crack the internet and rip it wide open?

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Know it's your vote and it's mine.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It'll all be okay.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If I had my say, I'd love at them to get the candidate online.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Come on at them, get run, Paul online.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There's $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm fasting, fasting, fasting, fasting, fasting.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I've read it in the news to dig it.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
$6,000 on the way.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll take another cut in bed.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm here.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Guess I'm just a lucky one, you think.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, would you run the road?

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Spive on something.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Know now the faster chance is to get to the man.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're the conscience of a nation.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're the one nearer girl.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So here's the country man.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll rest my glass up to you, your name.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And the world has text us in that.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Set you around that together.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And you know I can't help but now to know everything.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm another lifetime, all my way, I've been step by.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're the conscience of a nation.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're the one nearer girl.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Me now alone.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Me now alone.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Me now alone.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Me now alone.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Come with me.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Come with me.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Come with me.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Come with me.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Come, Come with me.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Cute and beautiful.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Your one nearer girl.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We're here to the content of the nation, so now I'm in here, here we go.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's a young America singing to you.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The Alexander the Soul of America from the Podsafe music network.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He's from Texas.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Coincidentally, we'll be talking to a gentleman from Texas in just a few moments.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
His daily source code episode number 677, a really important one for me.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Today, we're scheduled to speak with Dr. Ron Paul.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He is the Republican candidate from Texas.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He's a congressman.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He's been a congressman for 10 years, over 10 years.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I believe he's been in politics.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Also a medical doctor.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Everyone likes to always say he's delivered over more than 4,000 babies.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And we're going to talk to him today.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And as places many questions before him,

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
that have arisen on the daily source code in the past couple of weeks.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Since I discovered Dr. Ron Paul.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And I've got to tell you, I'm not nervous, but I'm kind of anxious because, you know,

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
politicians, no matter, you know, they're really trained at answering questions.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And always very protective.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So, you know, my strategy for this is first, I'm going to really suck up to him,

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
although it's meant and hard-filled.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Then I want to get a little background on just a constitution in general, I think.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And then ask a, you know, some questions about the issues that we've been discussing here.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And then, you know, all the other things that actually, you haven't sent me all that many questions I have to say.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Although, a lot of you have requested a discussion specifically about a couple of,

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
a couple of topics like the second amendment, like Roe versus Wade.

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So we'll do that.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And of course, I'll try and ask some personal questions as well.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Try to sneak those in.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So, I want to second.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm doing this through Skype.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Patricia's not home.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Christina's not home.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's three in the afternoon as agreed to the reason I'm saying they're not home.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So they can't be sucking on the bandwidth and make my Skype mess up.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, they're watching porn or YouTube video.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So, let's, let's, let's second.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Here we go.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hello.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Dr. Ron Paul.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It is.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hi, it's Adam Curry.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Good.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Dr. Ron, first of all, do you mind if I call you Dr. Ron?

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is that okay?

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's fine.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I just run.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, I kind of like Dr. Ron and sounds.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay.

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I just want to give you a little background on myself, my audience before we start,

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
which is the audience is about 500,000 in size spread across the entire globe.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
60% in the United States.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I myself am an American citizen.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I've contributed millions in income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax,

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
employ thousands of people, including giving them health and dental care.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I've only lived half of my life in the United States and therefore have a lot of experience with other forms of government.

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But most importantly, although I have no party affiliation, I come from a very long history of Republicans.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Many of whom have served in government.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So I know very well what the sacrifices are that that brings.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So to start off, I just want to say very sincerely.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I thank you for your service to the United States.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You are a true patriot.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Anyone who does this is a patriot.

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So I want to thank you for that to start off with.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Thank you.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And so in independent media, Dr. Ron, you know, there's no top of the hour, no news.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We have as much time as you have.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We don't have to hurry along.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I want to give you the opportunity to really delve into a lot of questions that my audience is as

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
bring to the table today through me.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And I personally, I just love you as I see as a man of dichotomy.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And which is really how I was introduced to you and the platform that you stand for and that you represent through the Internet.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Of course, you know, where you have a Republican who's against the war that grabs people's attention.

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You know, a medical doctor against centralized health care.

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Those things really always grab attention because because you have a platform.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I believe you stand on the platform of the Constitution, right?

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Correct.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So what I've noticed is you have this knack of relating every single issue that people are talking about, particularly in these elections.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Back to the Constitution, which actually I've seen in the debates usually goes uncontested, which is pretty interesting.

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So I'd just like to take a couple of the top issues that the audience has talked about.

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And maybe you could explain your position on each one.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And if possible, take it down to the constitutional level so we can really understand where you're coming from.

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Does that make sense?

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And and and really and this is this is kind of a really a really weird question.

148
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I believe that there's a huge misconception about the form of government that the United States is based on.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It would be fair to ask you if you could help American to forgotten or have not been educated and certainly residents of other countries to understand the difference between.

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The democracy and a republic just so we can set some very basic understanding of how America is supposed to work.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
First, the the republic means that things aren't dictated to us by a majority vote.

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If you appear democracy is one of the worst types of dictatorships because the majority can rule over the minority.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The majority protects minority rights and you take your government and decentralize it and you have representative governments.

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You don't just vote on everything and you don't have arbitrary definition of what rights are all about.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And it's supposed to be held in check with a contract which is the constitution.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And it was designed to establish a republic, not a non a democracy.

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Today we we have a democracy where majority dictates against the the minority.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And in the process we have lost a concept of the decentralization of government.

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Everything is centralized not only at the Washington level but even at the international level because now we're working on international government through the UN and WTO and the regional type.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And government so it's going in directly opposite direction of what was intended by the founders of this country to establish and the end of constitution they republican form of government.

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Did somewhere alone along the way did in the past you know over 200 years did something at high jack how did this happen that that we've gone from this concept which has written down and to be followed to what centralized government large government has become today.

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And it was gradual in in cities and it probably started immediately and the debates at the convention the constitution convention really dealt with this you know when you had the Hamiltonians argued for a strong centralized government where Jefferson argued for the decentralized government.

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So immediately after they started moving in that direction but it really didn't move dramatically away from the concept of republican republic until the 20th century.

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I think in the early part of that that century we changed our foreign policy toward empire rather than just protecting and dealing with our own republic.

165
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We changed our attitude about money.

166
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We changed our attitude about taxes we had income tax imposed on us as well as if they central bank.

167
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And throughout the 20th century it was continuous and in cities and of course we've had a lot of problems since we've had the century perpetual war.

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And business cycles that become more.

169
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
More rampant all the time and now we're in a midst of a problem dealing with our dollar today.

170
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is an all consequence of the natural tendency of some people who want to rule over others and also fade into it by a lot of people who like to be taken care of.

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And then they become negligent of the principles of the law and the principles of individual liberty.

172
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And we get careless and sometimes the prosperity that comes out of a of a freer society and more republican form of society tends to.

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Some people think only about the prosperity and forget about the principles and that's where we are today.

174
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We still have prosperity but it's based on borrowing.

175
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Not on the fact that we're a free people producing a lot of goods and services that the world wants.

176
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So as this was a gradual process over maybe 50, 60 years, maybe 100 years or quite a long time.

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But it would seem almost logical that we can't reverse that overnight. I mean, is this something it can even be reversed in a single or or double presidential term.

178
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's going to be difficult, but the thing you did good on this path and knowing the wrong path is of course not very not a very wise thing to do.

179
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And it is difficult, but if we don't do it, we will have a reversal or something much worse because this is the last little collapse.

180
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And do you think that's imminent within our lifetime the collapse of the system?

181
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I think the foundation is gone, but there's still a lot of facing confidence in the system that really doesn't have a sound foundation.

182
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The world still does a large degree trust the dollar less so every day and of course that's why the dollar is going down.

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But if the dollar is rejected and our house comes crashing down, we won't be able to maintain our empire and the welfare system collapses too.

184
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But a lot of people will suffer from it.

185
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But there is a way out of this and it's merely returning to what was originally intended by the Constitution.

186
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It will be the Constitution live within our means, bring our troops home.

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And we could reverse it, but it is not easy.

188
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's so well ingrained in the special interest control of the control of the system because the government controls the wealth through the taxes and through the inflationary process.

189
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And therefore, since they control and have the wealth, everybody has to go to Washington to get their parts either trying to get their part back again or getting to try to get control of it.

190
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And that's what's going on.

191
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's where all the energy is spent today is trying to recover or steal from the Naples and their neighbor just through the political process.

192
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So when you speak like this, which I think is very eloquent what you just said, do you talk like this at Republican Party gatherings?

193
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Do you even meet with other members of the Republican Party?

194
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And what do you call the power brokers think of this?

195
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So what is the response?

196
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Because it is what the Republican Party should stand for, I believe.

197
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Well, I don't go to any of the major parties and you know, functions, they national party functions.

198
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They probably wouldn't want to hear this message.

199
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I mean, I run as a Republican.

200
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I've been elected as a Republican for 10 times.

201
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I go to a rally, go to rallies in my own district.

202
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And every political talk I ever gave is always the same thing.

203
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And I'm able to get elected and real elected in my own district.

204
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But not many people knew me outside my district up until this campaign.

205
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So it is a bigger testing grounds.

206
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You're able to overcome it in a small district to overcome the status quo of the Republican Party.

207
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But it's a bigger challenge now and it's pretty clear when you see the debates that the other candidates aren't very comfortable with what I'm saying.

208
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah, I think there's a lot of Republicans and most Americans who agree with me.

209
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Let's talk about it.

210
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I do want to come back to that for a second about the party and your affiliation to it.

211
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But I'd like to just go through a couple of the issues that all candidates are talking about.

212
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But yet you have a very different take on them.

213
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If you wouldn't mind, we just go through a couple of them.

214
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And the one that has been big debate on this program with the audience is the second amendment, the right to bear arms.

215
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
There's huge misunderstanding of the amendment.

216
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
There's all kinds of different interpretations.

217
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And and that is I believe the basis for your willingness to bring back not just troops from Iraq, but troops from all around the world back to the United States.

218
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Could you just delve into that and hopefully as we peel the layers away, we'll get down to the actual amendment itself.

219
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So so we can understand your your take on it.

220
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah, the founders for rather clear in the Constitution not to give the authority the or imply that we have a responsibility to deal with other countries in a military sense or get involved in their internal affairs.

221
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And that's what they preach and that's what they followed.

222
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:31,000
We don't have a authority to do it and the advice is it doesn't do much good for us to get involved in nation building and policing the world and being involved in their affairs.

223
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And yet that's what we've been doing and that's how we've gotten ourselves in the trouble and that's why we're on the verge of a of a bankruptcy.

224
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But in the same sense, we both have a strong national fence and the founders believe the strongest defense came from the individuals being armed.

225
00:17:48,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And they were very clear about it and the purpose of having individuals being armed was their right to organize locally into malicious for the protection of their community and actually protection against.

226
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
We're bearing federal government. It wasn't just to worry about an invasion.

227
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But it was also they went to people to be armed because they knew what it was like under the British that the abuse of the military and the British military was such that they didn't want that to happen to the people again.

228
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So the second amendment was written for that purpose.

229
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And obviously it was in context of a foreign policy that we weren't supposed to have an empire on the world.

230
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So many people will say this amendment is outdated by today's standards. What is your stance on that?

231
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's probably more important than ever before.

232
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I mean, we're living in dangerous times and with the threat of terrorism.

233
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And that is pretty vague, but people who commit violent acts and these are criminals, these aren't governments that are invading us.

234
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So it becomes a lot different than a military approach.

235
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't know if it was like in the Cold War where we were frightened that the Soviets might attack us and maybe even invade and really try to do great harm to us.

236
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That was different than it is today. So terrorism is done by individuals who are distraught and don't have there's anybody's weak people because they don't have a political base and they don't have a military army behind them.

237
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And one of the best things to do is for people who don't properly be able to protect against individuals like that.

238
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So the immediate reaction to something like that is, oh yeah, but not 11 was different. Look at what they did.

239
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But it was the lack of respect for property rights and understanding of property in the lack of respect for the second amendment, which permitted that to happen.

240
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The government was already supposed to protect us from hijackers on airplanes. We weren't to have, the pilots weren't to have guns and you weren't supposed to resist.

241
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And the airlines weren't in charge with the government was in charge and they did, you know, had all the rules and regulations of screening.

242
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So strong emphasis on private property rights and emphasis that individuals can use guns to defend that property which many people do, individuals in most homes in the country.

243
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Most of our chemical plants and manufacturing plants are protected that way. If you have to have an armed car business falling money around, it's you that are responsible and not the government and that's where the greatest safety comes from.

244
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So I think today it's more important than ever to understand this. And if you look at the great harm done in the inner cities, they especially take the guns away from the poor in the inner cities.

245
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And those are the individuals who are most likely to be killed by violence because they don't have a weapon to defend themselves.

246
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So if you had to proper respect for the second amendment, just because you were poor and lived in an inner city, you wouldn't be denied this right to defend yourself if somebody was coming into your home.

247
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So those are mainly external threats. Do you feel that with the state of the union as it is today and being on the verge of being bankrupt as you say?

248
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Is it getting dangerously close to exercising our second amendment rights against internal attacks and mainly against the government?

249
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There are some in this country who believe that and are prepared. I'm not one of them. I'm working hard to try to prevent it. It's conceivable.

250
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So we now have government agents over 100,000 of them actually carry guns.

251
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
They can barge into our property and retirement combination now with the authority that they've got and to spoil everything that we do.

252
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Coming to our homes without warrants. I mean, it's a real mess. And if we have a financial crisis and there's a breakdown on the economy, there we're going to have a lot of violence.

253
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:18,000
People will be a lot less tolerance of the IRS agents and the FDA and everybody else and the A agents and the ATF and when they come around, there's going to be more violence.

254
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I believe I'm working to try to prevent that and devise a transitional system where we don't have to do that, but it's quite possible where it could come.

255
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let me ask you one other issue. Rovers is weighed, which I think is also grossly misunderstood. It seems that there are a number of rights in discussion here.

256
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:53,000
One is you're in a relatable right of your own body as with your own right and created by the given to you by the creator as well as a pro choice issue.

257
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That's the pro choice issue and then there's the right to life. It seems very complicated. And in fact, my head is hurting right now just thinking about it.

258
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Particularly you'd be a medical doctor. It seems like you know what you're talking about. Help me through this.

259
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Well, it is one of the more difficult issues because it's unique. If you have a truly libertarian viewpoint about your life and you can run your life as you choose.

260
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
This is pretty easy and I sort of take that position and I talk about it all the time.

261
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's your life. You can take your own decisions. If you want to build your body or your mind or your soul, you do it. But you suffer the consequences. You can come to the government or rob your neighbor to help me out if you messed up.

262
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But all of a sudden this becomes different with pregnancy. So the issue to me isn't privacy at all. I think that's a red hearing.

263
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I think the issue is, is there a live human being that deserves legal protection within the body of another person?

264
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And I've come down on the side of saying yes, there is a legal human being that deserves protection.

265
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And because I'm very much aware of my legal responsibilities as an OB doctor, if I ever get anything to enter the unborn, I can be sued because I've entered a human being.

266
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:23,000
If there's an accident, you're liable. If there's been a violent crime, you're responsible and can be hauled in the court for killing somebody.

267
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So you've no doubt there's a live human being that has rights and inheritance rights or establish it's time of conception, not at the time of birth, a father of an unborn is still has responsibility through inheritance laws.

268
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Now to that unborn child, if it's a proven child of the individual. So to me, it's absolutely illegal person.

269
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But it's still difficult because there are difficult terms. You know, one day after rape is that the same thing as one day before birth.

270
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And the more difficult these problems are, the smaller units of government I think should deal with it. So therefore I don't want the federal government involved.

271
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And robbers who's weighed happens to be in the trussies ruling, not only because it legalized the killing of any unborn, in any trimester.

272
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And over road, they over road all the state laws and said the state can't do anything to protect.

273
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:31,000
There was a violation of the concept of the republic and states rights. At the same time, they called as a privacy issue instead of a life issue.

274
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And they made it so much worse. So my goal would be to turn this back to states or get rid of rovers as weighed.

275
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And if there is sometimes a very, very difficult circumstance that the state has to deal with that.

276
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But the Supreme Court literally dictated medical procedures that were different in the first second and the third trimester.

277
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But they actually legalized the killing of a viable unborn in the third trimester. So that's something that we should even, even if somebody endorsed abortion on some sort of

278
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:19,000
limitations, they should find this a bit support to think that a two or a three or a four pound infant can be literally just destroyed.

279
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And with the argument, it has no right to live.

280
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Well, then let me ask it this way. And I don't think either of us are qualified to discuss the female reproductive system because we don't have one.

281
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So it's, I find it very hard to give an opinion on something. I'm just not schooled on you. Of course, literally our schooled on this.

282
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But as a politician, the right to your own body as a woman, do you not have the right to put in or take out of that body what you want if I want regardless of what it is?

283
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Of course, you have responsibility.

284
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm with the exception of right. You have the responsibility of the consequence of having in a course. So therefore that is the decision.

285
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,000
If you care that argument to its logical conclusion, I also think you have the right to your property at home. Your home is your castle.

286
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I don't want any cameras any of that. Nothing in there. You know, some parents might kill their children.

287
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:19,000
We don't put cameras in there because we don't take away rights of parents because one out of 14 million are billion might kill their child.

288
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:28,000
We don't remove any their rights. But if we know there's some parents in a home just murdering their children, all of a sudden this becomes very important.

289
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So the sanctity of the home is does not permit the killing of the children.

290
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So I think the analogy is reasonable to say that yes, there is a child. It's in the womb and it deserves some protection.

291
00:27:47,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But to say that it deserves done leads to some very weird things because if a patient comes to me and I'm doing abortions, I can get paid a lot of money to do the abortion right before birth.

292
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But if I do that one minute after birth, I go to prison from murder.

293
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And one time there was a case where the abortions did the abortion, but the baby was born alive, so he drowned the baby.

294
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And he had to go to, he had, I think he was convicted of a crime.

295
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
But if he had only killed the baby sooner, that's why this partial birth abortion developed.

296
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Because you didn't ever want the baby to be born alive, then you're a bad guy. But if you can just kill the baby immediately before this, this is not something that should be brushed off easily.

297
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But there, to me, there's one time that I think that it's a strictly immoral issue.

298
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The first, you know, in very, very early pregnancy, you know, it might be five or six days or so.

299
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:04,000
There's no way you can prove a crime is committed because you can't prove pregnancy by chemically, chemically legally, or by ultrasound.

300
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And one of them may not be pregnant, and so how can you prove a crime was committed?

301
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
She takes something to make sure that pregnancy doesn't take.

302
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And then it becomes strictly immoral choice.

303
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And I don't think you can legislate in that region.

304
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But you certainly can think more about what it's like in the third trimester, right before birth, whether or not abortion or done for convenience.

305
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Let me switch gears, Dr. Ron, to two things I just like your input on.

306
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:39,000
If, if you're elected president or perhaps you're already working on these issues now, global warming, your stance and what you think if anything should be done about it.

307
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Well, I don't have any answers for that. I read everything I can and I'm convinced that if you get close to where everybody knows something is so.

308
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I think there's room for being a contrary and especially in economics and in finances, that's always true.

309
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
When everybody knows what's going to happen tomorrow, you can burn.

310
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You can almost bet on it that the general information is wrong.

311
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So I've read that I think it's pretty good stuff on both sides of this argument.

312
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
To be concerned at the same time not to be overly concerned and that they're having cycles.

313
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
There's no doubt there's been cycles in temperature change and throughout the history of the Earth.

314
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And there's proof of that sometimes the Earth gets cold and sometimes it gets very warm.

315
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But I do think that pollution is a serious problem.

316
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
We should not ignore it.

317
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It properly writes approach means that you have no right to prove anybody's error in water and we should be cautious.

318
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I came up with a statistic the other day that I think is interesting.

319
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But if you look, if you were to see a two-emission emissions, you might look at who's doing it.

320
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
There are two-emitting countries in the world.

321
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Our Pentagon is 30-fifth in line of all those countries that burn oil.

322
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I think it's supposed to 400,000 barrels of oil a day that our Pentagon burns for something bombs endlessly.

323
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And allowing depleted uranium to be lying around in the various countries.

324
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So that's something I think we could do something about without pretending that if there are some natural weather changes that occur

325
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
that changes our temperatures over thousands of years.

326
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I don't think this is a whole lot we can do about that.

327
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And the things that we can do something about that I'm all for.

328
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Excellent.

329
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Are you familiar with the net neutrality issue, Dr. Ron?

330
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah, pretty much, pretty much so.

331
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Not in ultimate details, but just generally so.

332
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Any comment on that?

333
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Well, I'm taking a position on, I'm not for it although a lot of people in the, in the internet industry.

334
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
They love what I do except that position because they think that it might hurt the market.

335
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And my argument there is that we don't need government regulate.

336
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:08,000
If you accept the government regulating in a favorable way on the internet, then you've considered the authority to regulate in a negative way or even even go into taxation.

337
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So it's it's difficult, but I think some of the advantages some of the providers have have become about because of monopolies that they've had in the past.

338
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And I would deal with this in a different way rather than just regulating some protection.

339
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
A couple of general questions about your campaign.

340
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The main one being you've, and it's funny because I see mainstream asked this question all the time.

341
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I presume because they know the answer, but there's never any follow up, which is if you're not nominated for the Republican ticket that you will not run as an independent.

342
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Which is correct, I presume.

343
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
That's correct.

344
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Why?

345
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Is this like a Ralph Nader situation where it could split the party and the Democrats who win by default?

346
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I haven't thought it through.

347
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's probably just personal and there's a lot of energy that goes into the essence.

348
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's not like I haven't tried that before.

349
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You know, I did run as a libertarian, you know, a while back and it's really very tough.

350
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I mean, the whole system is so biased against an individual that's independent or a third party.

351
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Ross Perode did pretty well, but he had spent a lot of money, so unless you have a whole lot of money.

352
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Today, at least there's some recognition that I can get into the debate and I've made inroads this way.

353
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But if I've been doing this outside of major parties, nobody would know my name.

354
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And it's a very, very difficult to do.

355
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's a difficult and I think that I have to put on my energies into what I'm doing now and there's the possibility that the people really want me to be president.

356
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's going to come about this way, not by me following up and trying to do it in an alternative way.

357
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:09,000
The big news about Ron Paul, Congressman Ron Paul, is that the internet has clearly embraced your message, which I think is logical because the internet is basically one big copying propagation machine.

358
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And when you put something on it that catches fire or has legs, it travels very, very quickly.

359
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:25,000
That can be a funny video of someone shooting a bottle rocket out of his butt or it could be the message of freedom and the constitution.

360
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What are you doing to play into that form of communication?

361
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Because it appears to me that presidential elections, it's still about who can get the most money because that means you can advertise more or more effectively.

362
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Do you see it as two separate places or do you see it as one and as one influence the other and what do you, what is your main strategy for communicating with the constituency through online?

363
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Well, we're doing it all the time and it's almost sometimes at the beginning it was in spite of ourselves because we knew it was important and we hope we could tap into it.

364
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But actually the internet tapped into our campaign once the message got out that I was running and I knew the message that came to us.

365
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
We got groups just started growing and now there's over a thousand of them.

366
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So it feeds on itself because they come to us, they volunteer and it ends up they send this money as well.

367
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:28,000
While we're getting free advertisement and free support over the internet, we also get the funding that will help us do the ordinary campaign through television radio.

368
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That's what we've started to do and we'd like to say that it was all because we were so smart and we were able to harness the internet.

369
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:46,000
But although we knew the importance of it, I think we were just really astounded and how popular the message would be and how quickly it would spread.

370
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So I was very impressed with this.

371
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
May I give you some advice on that point, Dr. Ron?

372
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:01,000
When you're interviewed and when the mainstream media brings this up because you know it's like the internet phenomenon and your answer is pretty much what you just said is well you know the internet kind of found us.

373
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Could I just make a small recommendation which is it's not lying but it's kind of it's it's a tactic.

374
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Maybe you could consider saying yes we've cracked the code of the internet.

375
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You don't have to explain how but that just will put so much fear in everybody.

376
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
That I'm so frightened of you because no one has been able to do that.

377
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Well that's what some of the users you know when we when the when it pulls you know after the debate they think we have cracked the code.

378
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:36,000
We can we know something they don't know but if it were just money in organization the rest of the characters I'm sure we're doing the same thing.

379
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,000
In the course we haven't done it but I see it's almost like a fun thing to do that would really cause them to get a little bit excited.

380
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Well yeah I mean yet you have to kind of you know play along with the game I think a little bit which brings me to the advertising.

381
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I've actually heard some of your your radio advertising and what was interesting to me is that it was a very different kind of message than what is propagating so quickly on the internet it's very much.

382
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm not like this guy I'm not like that candidate I voted this way as opposed to that person sound so incredibly traditional.

383
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Who actually does is your media advisor do you have an advertising agency that buys the the time do you have someone who manages that specifically are you involved in that process.

384
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Well we're all involved I'm very much involved because I've been in this for a long time and I'm always afraid if I just turn it over to a company.

385
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:41,000
That they would be too conventional and I don't want to lose the message so the last thing I want them to do is to do as they we got a appeal to the Republican base and that means we have to soften your stand on the wall or.

386
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Or stopping your stand of civil liberties I didn't know way that's my trademark and I will not have that so I keep very close tabs on that but we use various people in the if the people in the campaign aren't.

387
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You know that a professional you know political people but there are people who are dedicated for the philosophy and the pandemic experience and they help a whole lot and working on these.

388
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I found that personally I found it's much better when someone else says this guy is great instead of yourself obviously or or kind of like a.

389
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:25,000
A dark voice announcer guy something else you just might want to consider is there's plenty of people who have I've seen on YouTube alone I've seen probably 10,000 different.

390
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Television or video commercials I've heard tons of audio versions that could easily be used on radio.

391
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm just saying you might want to consider listening to some of those messages or have someone see if there's anything that is is usable because that message is sometimes so much stronger than what I've heard from.

392
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
From the radio commercials just to just.

393
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah and I think as to our radio commercials our song starting off you know to talk to people who've never heard my name before not to talk to people who know me on the internet and I do watch those.

394
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
As in those videos on the internet and some of them are very emotional I think they're very powerful.

395
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But I think as time goes on we'll get close to that.

396
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I like to make one other suggestion that I have a few more minutes I could take a few more questions but I'm going to have to go shortly.

397
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Sure thank you and I really appreciate your time so right now I'll just fire off a few right now there's a major push online for November fifth I don't know if you're familiar with this.

398
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:32,000
There's a and it's just traveling through the internet you can't start it or stop at these things and the idea is we call it kind of a bum rush the charts it's been done very successfully in mainly with music purchasing and book purchasing.

399
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I believe that everyone's going to start donating on one day specifically to really make a big jump.

400
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I have heard that that is not necessarily endorsed or even desired by your campaign do you want to comment on that.

401
00:39:46,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Well I know about it I hear about it and it certainly wasn't originated in the campaign but I don't know how anybody could want to get too far from you know if somebody wants to raise a lot of money and have a surprise and have a media event that on one particular day that we raise a huge amount of money.

402
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I can't see how anybody with that it's a bad idea.

403
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Excellent.

404
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Two more questions nine eleven conspiracy theories do you buy any of it Dr. Ron.

405
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Not really not the kind that I say well it was all conspired by our government and and that they get it for this purpose of ushering in this war on terrorism not a believe in that.

406
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I believe because it's very very clear evidence that the Neo Conservatives in the way sort of welcome the event because they even wrote about a Pearl Harbor type event that they might be able to use to promote their cause and they and they certainly have.

407
00:40:46,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Where where some of the stuff gets overlapping confused is that I don't think the nine eleven commission investigation was worth a whole lot because I think it was mainly designed to cover up mistakes and endless of government not so much to cover up or hide a conspiracy or a plan to do this.

408
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The whole thing about the government I think that the evidence was there that if we had you know some really sharp people watching what they and the information they accumulated they would have known there was something very big coming on and yet they.

409
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:31,000
We haven't really arrested or fired or blamed anybody for the toe and that this is allowing nine eleven to attack so I think those are two different issues.

410
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So you're saying possible but definitely not enough information on the table.

411
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Well I don't think there's any information say that the government planned the event what I'm saying is that they had information buried in the accumulation of all these files that they didn't pay enough attention to for instance there was one FBI agent that.

412
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,000
The dozens and dozens of time reported to the series that somebody was trying to fly airplanes that not land them and he was totally ignored.

413
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I don't think they did that.

414
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I think I was in happiness rather than a conspiracy to allow it to happen.

415
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Well Dr. Ron you I've said this before on on my show you you take all of the boxes that I'm looking for I wholeheartedly endorse you and I will be sending you money today to back that up and signing your endorsement form.

416
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I really appreciate what you're doing I'm 43 and I'm tired I can only imagine how tired you are.

417
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
It's a very tiring business particularly beyond the spotlight like that and so it's it's greatly appreciated.

418
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
The final question I have for you which is extremely important are you a folder or a scruncher.

419
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm a folder or a scruncher.

420
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
There is a scruncher.

421
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Yes so when you use toilet paper do you fold it or do you scrunch it?

422
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Well I think I think this is getting off of the target a little bit.

423
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Is there a proper way to do it Dr. Ron as a medical doctor?

424
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
No I think everybody's independent minded into each zone.

425
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Fantastic.

426
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Dr. Ron any time you want me to help you with the network of independent producers that I can speak to please feel free to give me a call.

427
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I'll be happy to contribute to the calls.

428
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Thank you very much Dr. Ron.

429
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Bye bye.

430
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Who?

431
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Why don't we decompress for a second?

432
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
We'll come back and discuss.

433
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Who are you?

434
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Who are you?

435
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Who are you?

436
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Who are you?

437
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Who are you?

438
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Who are you?

439
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Who are you?

440
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Who are you?

441
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Who are you?

442
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Who are you?

443
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Who are you?

444
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Who are you?

445
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Who are you?

446
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Who are you?

447
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Who are you?

448
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Who are you?

449
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Who are you?

450
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Who are you?

451
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Who are you?

452
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Who are you?

453
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Who are you?

454
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Who are you?

455
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Who are you?

456
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Who are you?

457
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Who are you?

458
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Who are you?

459
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,980
Who are you?

460
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,980
I've been waiting for you, and I've seen a massive victory

461
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,980
Are you the best of you ever after all?

462
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,980
But nobody knows you've been waiting for you, baby

463
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,980
All you've been is all the one thing you've missed in my life

464
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,980
From all the way, please

465
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,980
The storming on me, of America

466
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,980
The storming on me, of America

467
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,980
Don't over~)

468
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,980
That's let it back, that's the whole team

469
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,980
You're grown r of death, now you're buildin' us

470
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,980
They're struggling to make people who die

471
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,980
っ� racist, so dare you lest you hear me

472
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,980
I have a home on the Wallmanup spot

473
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,980
Do it on the America

474
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,980
Come on up and let it go

475
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,980
Come on up and let it go

476
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,980
Come on up and let it go

477
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,980
Come on up and let it go

478
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,980
Come on up and let it go

479
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,980
Come on up and let it go

480
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,980
Come on up and let it go

481
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,980
Come on up and let it go

482
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,980
Come on up and let it go

483
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,980
Come on up and let it go

484
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,980
Come on up and let it go

485
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,980
Come on up and let it go

486
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,980
Come on up and let it go

487
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,980
COME ON UP and let it go

488
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,980
Come on up and let it go

489
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,980
Go my shoulder kalk

490
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,980
and stop

491
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,980
Fight your Pat procedure

492
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,980
for you

493
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:15,960
and fight you

494
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,980
Come on up and let it go

495
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,380
I know ain't enough of mine

496
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,180
Those are not bad, I can't go

497
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,580
To make you laugh

498
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,380
Don't know if you're gonna go

499
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,780
I'm sure that people aren't

500
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:36,780
That I can't break all new things

501
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,780
I can't go, I can't go, I can't go

502
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,580
Don't know if you're gonna go

503
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,580
Don't know if you're gonna go

504
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,380
Those are not bad, I can't go

505
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,380
Don't know if you're gonna go

506
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,380
Don't know if you're gonna go

507
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,380
I'm sure that people aren't

508
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,380
That I can't go, I can't go

509
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,380
That's the Dingo Brothers

510
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,380
Collectively notice to Dingo Pie

511
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,380
The Dominion of America

512
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,380
Of course, also brought to you from the pod save music network

513
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,380
Links to that song in the show notes a daily source code dot com

514
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,380
So I hope you understood what I was trying to do

515
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:18,380
It was basically get Dr. Ron on record on the most of the things that we've talked about

516
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,380
I didn't go into real debate

517
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,380
I tried to ask some follow-up questions

518
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,380
We're appropriate but I really wanted him to just speak until he stopped speaking

519
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,380
Which I think we kind of captured

520
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,380
So one thing I know for sure

521
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,380
I have to listen to the interview

522
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,380
Myself in order to even really comment on it

523
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,380
Because I know that there's things I missed and didn't hear

524
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,380
Because I was thinking of the next question

525
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,380
That's always a bit challenging

526
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,380
Again, this was what a great pleasure

527
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,380
To be able to do this and really have a conversation

528
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,380
Not be hassled by a producer telling me to stop

529
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,380
Ooming and I just get on with the next question

530
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,380
So we talked about second amendment

531
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:58,380
His answer I think was he's really trying to stop

532
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,380
The potential bloodshed

533
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,380
That was interesting

534
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,380
Rovers is weighed

535
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,380
Early termination would be a moral issue

536
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,380
Since the crime cannot be proven

537
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,380
Wow strong language there

538
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,380
And I just jotted down some notes here

539
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,380
He felt there was room for a contrarian view

540
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,380
He's concerned we should be concerned

541
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,380
But not overly

542
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,380
Net neutrality didn't sound like he really knew that much about it

543
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,380
But he has a pretty clear stance on

544
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,380
The fact that any regulation of the internet

545
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,380
is not a good thing and he does

546
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,380
It sounded like he has some form of a plan

547
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,380
It's to how he would attack that

548
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,380
Particularly the telcos and the monopolies

549
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,380
Which I think is very encouraging

550
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,380
And then if he's not on the Republican ticket

551
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,380
Then he won't run it all

552
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,380
And when I asked why

553
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,380
I think he said I don't know

554
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,380
Although he said personal too much energy

555
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,380
He's tried it before

556
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,380
I was quite interesting to hear

557
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,380
It's like wow

558
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,380
Someone would actually give up

559
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,380
But I can understand

560
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,380
Hey did I get him to laugh

561
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,380
Like almost like a high school girl

562
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,380
About cracking the code

563
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,380
I really hope he does that

564
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,380
Wouldn't that be funny?

565
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,380
Actually he said he said it would be fun

566
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,380
He said yeah we've cracked the code of the internet

567
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,380
Let's see if that turns up somewhere

568
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,380
We talked about the advertising

569
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,380
He met some valid points there

570
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,380
And maybe I just gave him an idea

571
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,380
That he could use some alternative creative work

572
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,380
Maybe I should have mentioned creative work

573
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,380
I was hard

574
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,380
November 5th

575
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,380
That's what I'm going to

576
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,380
So I endorse that idea

577
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,380
Now that I'm going to

578
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,380
To give it what I think the maximum of

579
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,380
$2,300

580
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,380
I'm going to do it on November 5th

581
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:39,380
And I think it's a good idea

582
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,380
That'll be fun

583
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,380
Let's see if we can make the needle move on that one

584
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,380
9, 11

585
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,380
I thought he said something

586
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,380
I wrote this down that the new conservatives

587
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,380
In a way

588
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:51,380
Welcome the event

589
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,380
Wow strong mojo there

590
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,380
And of course huge disappointment at the end

591
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,380
Where he would not devolve whether he is a scruncher

592
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,380
Or a folder

593
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,380
But apparently he makes no difference

594
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,380
Because you can do with your body

595
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,380
What you wish

596
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,380
Okay, homework once again

597
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,380
If you haven't seen the constitution classes

598
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,380
Do yourself a favor and check that out

599
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,380
Because if you didn't already

600
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,380
Get a better understanding of this presidential candidate

601
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,380
You probably will

602
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,380
By going through that

603
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,380
And it's important

604
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,380
If you've got Americans in your life or in your country

605
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,380
Then you should know what they stand for

606
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,380
And what the rules are

607
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,380
Anyway thanks to the campaign

608
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,380
The hundreds and the thousands of people

609
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,380
Who helped and put this together

610
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,380
And I look forward to your feedback

611
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,380
And I'm sure this conversation will continue

612
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,380
What do we say we meet here for Fubar?

613
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,380
