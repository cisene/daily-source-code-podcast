1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,220
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's

2
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:30,220
last gleaming, whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,

3
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:46,420
for the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming, and the rocket's red glare, the bombs

4
00:00:47,420 --> 00:01:12,420
through the night that our flag was still there, O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave?

5
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:32,420
For the land of the free, and the home of the brave.

6
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,420
Hey there, Adam, this is Wilson Bradley from Knoxville.

7
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,420
On a DSC-628 with 4th of July right around the corner, thought it might be a good time to

8
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,420
share with your listeners to be careful with fireworks, and most of all don't stick them down

9
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,420
your pants.

10
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:54,420
The fourth always reminds me of Roland Bubba Jenkins, who went on to see our Lord after a strange

11
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:02,420
course of events, involved in a dill pickle, an M80, and a pair of boxer shorts soaked in moonshine.

12
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:12,420
And as with most redneck fatalities, it has all started with those three words, hey watch this.

13
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,420
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the recovery

14
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,420
for what it stands.

15
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:43,420
One nice under God, indivisible with liberty, and justice for all.

16
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,420
What did those words mean to you?

17
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:57,420
May they say, thank you, America, for your strength, for pride, for our freedom.

18
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,420
It's been a beacon of the world for 200 years.

19
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:10,420
For these bright stars are 50 states, each burning its own stamp of indivisible.

20
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,420
People, 200 million strong.

21
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,420
People have come to Earth from all corners of the earth.

22
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,420
And we're going to be calling for a wretched thing.

23
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:29,420
A land of laws, an ingenious system of checks and balances, that allows no man to become

24
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,420
tired.

25
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,420
And let's no group for a day.

26
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,420
If their power is not tempered, real concern for the government.

27
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,420
A land where the right of descent, the free speech, is jealously God.

28
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,420
For the valid box is this side.

29
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,420
The people, it's real.

30
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,420
Landation, under God.

31
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,420
A land where freedom of worship is a cornerstone of her being.

32
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,420
A land raised to the temples and churches.

33
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,420
Cinagogues and all groups that rise and profusion to embrace all the religions of the world.

34
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,420
A land forged by the hot steel and raw parents.

35
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,420
And formed forever, at the awful crucible, civil war.

36
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,420
Great liberty.

37
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:23,420
Our man and pursuit of an honest life will not be denied his chance.

38
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,420
Well, the citizens who freely within their vast borders will have.

39
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,420
In groups of fear, a land brimming with opportunity.

40
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,420
A freedom of choice is the guideline for all.

41
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,420
And justice.

42
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,420
The courts of our land are open to all.

43
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,420
It's wheels of justice, groundwork, all causes, all people.

44
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,420
They look to every avenue for justice.

45
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,420
Every concern of the law.

46
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,420
And they can't wear their reasoning with mercy.

47
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,420
For all.

48
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:17,420
I pray to be chance to the land of the United States.

49
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:25,420
And we pray to the land of the United States.

50
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:33,420
And to the land of the United States.

51
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:41,420
For we pray to the land of the United States.

52
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:51,420
One nation of the United States.

53
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:59,420
And we pray to the land of the United States.

54
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:05,420
We pray to the land of the United States.

55
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,420
Hell yeah.

56
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,420
Homey old fashion.

57
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,420
But John Wayne with the Duke says it.

58
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:17,420
Yes, feel proud to be American, don't you?

59
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,420
Happy Fourth of July, America.

60
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,420
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

61
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,420
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

62
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:39,420
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

63
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,420

Everybody's talking stuff so much and let you.

66
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,420
Come in the reality, but just for one day.

67

Surrey known as Gilford in the in the curry manner, I do want to wish everyone a very happy

171
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,380
fourth of July. I'm feeling extremely patriotic today. In fact, it's been a really weird

172
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:28,700
week because on Friday speaking of patriotism, I received my official permanent visa to live

173
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:34,380
and work in the United Kingdom. And of course, I am extremely grateful to the home office and

174

to the Queen and all the rules and regulations that allow me to do that because it is good

175
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:45,980
to be living in the motherland where we initially came from. But you may be kind of second

176
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,820
by the show I have lined up for you. And then again, there may be a few surprises in there. It's

177
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,780
going to be a bit music heavy. Of course, a pod save music lined up like you heard from Justa,

178
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:02,060
who is from the UK, actually. Interestingly enough, I had a quick consultation with the

179
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,700
Board of Directors of the Organization for the Preservation to the soundtrack of our lives,

180
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:13,260
UPSOL.org. It's registered, but we don't have a website up yet. And they agree that there are

181
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:19,100
some exemptions to what you can do in independently, produce stuff on independence day,

182
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:26,380
on July 4th, and in your podcast because there are many, many backyard barbequees. I'm talking

183
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:32,700
about huge ones with 50 to 100, maybe even 200 hundreds of people, people gathering at picnics,

184
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,980
people gathering all over the world, not just the United States, citizens all over the world coming

185
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:50,700
together and enjoying hamburgers, hot dogs, gains, fireworks, and yes, music. But the RIA, as evil

186
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,260
as they really appear to be, they don't go around to all these picnics and barbequees.

187
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:02,220
They don't go around levying fees on the 4th of July, even though they technically can,

188
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,140
because you're performing music for a large audience. No, because you don't do those things.

189
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:14,940
That would be why gosh, that would be un-American. So today, please join me on a very large picnic,

190
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:22,060
known as The Charly, and I got songs for you. Songs that will make you feel proud to be an American.

191
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:29,580
Maybe even a little bit ambience. Go ahead search for America in Napster. You'll see.

192
00:13:52,060 --> 00:14:07,340
America to me. The house I live in, a platter of earth of street,

193
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:17,340
a grocer and the butcher and the people that I meet, the children in the playground,

194
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:27,820
the faces that I see, all races and religions, that's America to me.

195
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:43,100
The ways I work in, the worker at my side, the little town or city, where my people live

196
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:55,580
then die, the howdy and the handshake, they're a feeling free in the right to speak my mind out.

197
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:06,140
That's America to me. The things I see about me, the big things in the small,

198
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:16,300
the little corner, new stand, and the house, a mile tall, the wedding and the church,

199
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:27,260
the laughter and the tears, the dream that's been a growing for a hundred and a year.

200
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:40,300
The town I live in, the street, the house, the road, the pavement of the city,

201
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:51,740
or a garden all in blue, the church, the school, the clubhouse, the billion lights I see,

202
00:15:51,740 --> 00:16:12,620
what a special meal of people. It's so incredibly difficult to explain what it means to be

203
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,020
American and feel American, but the chairman of the board, New Jersey's finest son,

204
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,620
Frank Sinatra, sums it up nicely. In the house I live in, that's America to me, damn straight.

205
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,620
You know, there's so many similarities and differences, and I think what I want to do today

206
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,580
on the show is really just trying to explain how I feel as an American, how I think many Americans

207
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,380
feel, and what is America really? It's a very, very, very young country, you've only been around

208
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:47,740
for a bit over 200 years. You know, that's only four of my current lifetimes. You know,

209
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,140
well, a little bit more than that. So, call it five because you should. That's nothing. That is

210
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,340
nothing. I can trace that back in my family history. I can look at a family tree and see that in

211
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:03,740
in one glance. And what do we consist of? We consist of you guys. We consist of Europeans.

212
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,660
Initially, of course, that's how I trace my bloodlines. They go back to Scotland

213
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:15,580
through Kansas, to Scotland, of all, of all connections. And yes, I am less than five degrees

214
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:26,460
separated from Kevin Bacon as well. But something, uh, boy, somewhere, something went wrong.

215
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:34,380
And it, you know, really, it's all about, it's really about PR. You know, we have our presidents,

216
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,980
are really the, first of all, they're the leaders of our country, which in essence is a corporation.

217
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,180
And we all contribute to the corporation. And we love the way the corporation works in general.

218
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,020
And there's always fucked up stuff with corporations. We're really a massive giant Google.

219
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,380
We don't really want to do any evil. We don't want to be evil. But because of our sides and because

220
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,860
of all the differences and all the different officers and board members and everything that's

221
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:05,340
in their shit happens. And so we're far from perfect. We don't call the president of the

222
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:11,500
United States the chief executive officer for nothing, the CEO. Now CEOs are really important.

223
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:18,380
Look at Steve Jobs, a fantastic CEO for Apple. I mean, the think of, if Apple really feels more

224
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:24,060
American to me than anything, that's strange as it may seem to draw that analogy. But really,

225
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:30,540
some great stuff, people who work hard are dedicated a little bit too secretive for, you know,

226
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:38,060
for my personal taste. But, and look at George Bush, he sucks. He's, as a PR guy, you know,

227
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:43,500
he's on, he's awful. He gives horrible demo. You know, his demos are always crashing.

228
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,020
He just doesn't know how to communicate. But there have been lots of people throughout the

229
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,220
history of the United States who have really done an excellent job at communicating what we really

230
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:01,020
are. And we're different. We are different. We are, we are brash. We are loud. We have much less

231
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,300
of sense of style and taste. But because we've been developing our own, we're like a fricking

232
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,020
teenager of the world. And right now, you know, we're past the teenage years. We're no longer

233
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,460
that cute and we're maturing. And we've got to think about settling down a little bit. But still

234
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,500
inside us, inside the American spirit burns of fire. And there's no such thing as a

235
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:30,700
true pure American. We're an immigrant country. We exist of other countries. So it's, it's a collection

236
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:39,820
of like-minded people. Yeah, we're kind of like a team, kind of like team America. Oh, we love

237
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:47,180
saying that. Don't we? I don't know if you've ever seen the movie. Team America. But it is,

238
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:54,060
it's an animated movie. Rent it. See if you can find a copy online. It does also display

239
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:00,620
a side of America and what Americans are that will make you laugh, but there really is some truth

240
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,860
to it because we really are. Well, we're America. Fuck yeah.

241
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:21,500
America, fuck yeah, call it a fear to see the mother of the day. Yeah, America, fuck yeah.

242
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:28,460
The fear is being owned. And the rest of your game is through. Because now you have to

243
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:39,580
answer to America, fuck yeah, to link my thoughts on America, fuck yeah. What you're going to do

244
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:49,260
when we come for you. Yeah, it's a dream of me all year. It's the whole world. Fuck yeah.

245
00:20:49,260 --> 00:21:05,340
When you come for you, it's the whole world. Yeah, yeah. I know where they're headed.

246
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,020
Yeah, yeah.

247
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:37,020
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

248
00:21:37,020 --> 00:22:07,020
let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, yeah, go let's go let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, oh no, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's make our�zo idea, this is the big deal, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

249
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:12,260
You know, actually, I should probably roll out the jingle for this.

250
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
Let me see.

251
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,140
Oh, it's been so long since I've done Yanks versus the Brits.

252
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,540
I don't know how the jingle queueed up.

253
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,540
Let me see.

254
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,300
Maybe I can find it real quick.

255
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,580
Oh, man, unbelievable.

256
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,780
Well, I do have a Yanks versus the Brits, which is a pretty appropriate for the

257
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,020
fourth of July.

258
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,980
And also for, well, kind of the world that, oh, how can I can't find it?

259
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,580
Brits versus Yanks?

260
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,780
Oh, I feel like a shit now.

261
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,100
The Yanks, the Brits, crap.

262
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100
Okay.

263
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,100
It's the Yanks versus the Brits.

264
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Ooh.

265
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
There you go.

266
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,340
So, of course, we had a terrorist scare, or at least what's being built as a terrorist

267
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,340
scare.

268
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,700
Some pretty unsophisticated terrorists, I would say, here in the UK, I mean, they drive a

269
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,780
frickin' car on fire into a terminal building through a glass and steel wall with

270
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,900
propane tanks in the back, and they can't, and nothing happens.

271
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,580
Nothing, it doesn't work.

272
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,420
In fact, what happens is the guy catches on fire and the police have to put him out.

273
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,340
What kind of al Qaeda training did you follow?

274
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,340
Anyway.

275
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,460
So, the Brits, I've talked about this before, man, they're a vigilant bunch.

276
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,260
It's like, all right, you know, we live through the frickin' Blitz Creek, and World War

277
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,260
2.

278
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,260
This does not sway us at all.

279
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,900
In fact, he comes to helicopter now to pick me up, I think.

280
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,860
So, we had discussed this at Pod Show HQ, and we decided that it would be, at least,

281
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,140
the correct gesture to say, you know, if anyone doesn't feel safe coming to the office

282
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,260
because we are in, you know, in London, pretty much in a very near where everything's

283
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:57,580
taking place, except for, of course, Glasgow, but we had a bomb loaded car or a propane tank

284
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:04,380
filled car outside of a nightclub, and we decided to let the staff at the crash pad

285
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:09,140
know that, hey, you know, if you want to work from home, it's okay, we're cool with that.

286
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,620
And I knew what the answer would be, because literally, you know, it's, that's the kind

287
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,420
of response you get, oh, really appreciated very kind of you, but fuck no, we're going

288
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,540
to, we're just going to continue, we're not going to let these fuckers get us down, regardless

289
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,540
of where they're from.

290
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,660
Now, in the other hand, there's something really, really troubling that I'm noticing

291
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,860
now, and this is something you will not see in the United States, at least I have not

292
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,860
witnessed it yet.

293
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,300
So, conversation just in the office in general doesn't matter who said what, but there

294
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,340
is a general tendency, not just in the office, I hear this around, you know, where people

295
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:46,900
will say, oh, you know, let's walk around the Asian-looking guy, and by the way, you know,

296
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:55,460
the Asian in context here, someone could be from India or Pakistan, or from, from the far east,

297
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,260
that all falls under Asia, most Americans don't realize that, and we think of an Asian

298
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:05,780
as basically the yellow man, that's what we think of in the US, so that's incorrect.

299
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:10,420
But anyway, you know, there's something really bad happening, is people are becoming afraid

300
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:15,500
of other people just for the way they look, and I don't think that is happened in the

301
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
States.

302
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,700
I don't think that people walked down the street and see an Asian person and say, oh, shit,

303
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,380
you know, that could be a terrorist, because we're so, we're all foreigners, we're all

304
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,700
aliens really in the United States.

305
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:39,500
So Britain, beware, don't go down that road, you really should not, you know, because

306
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:45,660
that's hypocritical, you can't be, you know, all stiff upper lip and vigilant on the outside,

307
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,460
but, you know, secretly be routing around people.

308
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,060
So please, please don't slip into that, you guys got, you got a good thing going here,

309
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:58,340
and we've emulated a lot of it, we've taken a lot of the great things, and, and,

310
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:04,300
and we've come up with some pretty cool things of our own, as I said, Taco Bell and Band-Aids.

311
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
Fuck yeah.

312
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,900
All right, let's just place up a pot safely, out of Xander.

313
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,580
I've read an Indonesia diggin' 6,000 man off all the way.

314
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,580
I took another cut in bed, I'm here, guess I'm just a lucky one, you think.

315
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:33,140
What you've read the wrong, spive on something, I'm now the faster chance, just a kid to the man.

316
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:40,980
You're the conscience of a nation, yeah, so love on me here, girl.

317
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:51,460
So here's the cut through man, I'll rest my glass up to you, your name.

318
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,900
And the wildest Texas will never set you around, let you in there.

319
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:10,340
And you know I can't help but now to now be feeling, I'm not a lifetime, I'm a way, I best you by.

320
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:17,620
You're the conscience of a nation, yeah, so love on me here, girl.

321
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:52,020
And you know I can't help but now to now be feeling, I'm not a lifetime, I'm a way, I best you by.

322
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:59,060
You're the conscience of a nation, yeah, so love on me here, girl.

323
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:13,940
We're you the conscience of a nation, yeah, so love on me here, girl.

324
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,300
Lee Alexander, soul of America, summon it up real nice.

325
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:24,900
Again, just look, just look for songs in your favorite music store, go to iTunes, search for the word

326
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,460
America, search for USA, look how many songs have been written about our country.

327
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,100
And compare that to your own country, you know, there's a big conversation here going on today

328
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,900
about, I believe Gordon Brown said, you know what, we should be flying the Union Jack on public

329
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:45,620
buildings, right on, right on, and of course there's all the wires are all crossed here, there's

330
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:50,260
there's always people who were saying, well, you know, that's nationalism and yeah,

331
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:56,820
fuck that, fly your flag, be proud. Well, I'll just, you know, don't confuse what you see on television

332
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,700
and who you see on television and what they claim to represent, don't confuse that with the people of

333
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:10,740
a nation, you know, the, the, the Iotola in Iran, the Shah, whatever the dude's name is,

334
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:17,620
I forget his name, the president. You know, Aberdeen is young, you know, it's like,

335
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,780
you know, all these guys, they don't represent what the people are like,

336
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:31,220
it's just like you and me, except in America, we're a little different, we're unrefined.

337
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,140
Really, you know what we're bad at, what we've really gotten, we've really, I think everyone is

338
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,540
sucking at this. I've seen a lot of this and the European Union is now dealing with this.

339
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:46,580
We forget that we're in charge, we forget that we really control how things work. It's not the

340
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,660
president that makes decisions, even if you read the news just a little bit, you can see that it's

341
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:55,780
Congress and you need to write your congressmen and how the Senate works and how bills are created

342
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,660
in past and sent on to the president. You know, and if we get fed up with someone sending bills back

343
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,260
and vetoing them, you know, there's ways out of that, you know, this was all set up hundreds of

344
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,420
years ago. We know how to do this. What are they teaching these kids in school these days?

345
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot of talk. That's, that's the problem. We have a lot of talk talk talk.

346
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:20,100
We forget to write, you know, my grandfather who passed away. He was 98 years old. He passed away

347
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:26,420
about 10 years ago. And I recall so well, every single time we, and you know, we have our union

348
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:32,020
coming up and it's being held at the family house, if you will. Mead Road, Armok, New York.

349
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:39,140
Um, he, I, I recall so well. He would sit at his typewriter day and night, banging out letters

350
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:44,580
to senators and congressmen and other Washington officials. And he changed things. He really,

351
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,180
he really did. He helped set policy a single individual. He was able to do that. And so can

352
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:55,220
you and it's become so easy with email. It doesn't have to be about protest all the time. It doesn't

353
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:04,980
have to be about saying, I will fuck him. We'll get a new guy or gal in 2008. No, no, no, no, we, we

354
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,660
have to do it ourselves. I look at our own little company. You know, we have about 100 people.

355
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:16,100
And it functions the same way America does. There's no one that says, please show up at 7 o'clock

356
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,580
so we can get this shit done. People just show up because that's the way it works. We all contribute.

357
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:27,860
We all want to make it happen. Now, somewhere in, uh, in the 80s and 90s, some things did change.

358
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,980
And this, of course, was really media. And, uh, a lot of things got blown out of proportion.

359
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,380
And it's a very powerful tool, which is why I'm so happy that we have podcasts and other ways

360
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:43,620
of creating independent media, because we can take control back of that as well. And what happened was,

361
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,100
freedom of speech started to get squelched a little bit. You know, it was really a, really a

362
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,620
conversation about political correctness, about, uh,

363
00:31:53,620 --> 00:32:03,300
lasciviousness, about proper use of language, about the beauty of the human form and about just

364
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,580
being horny.

365
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:33,380
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right

366
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:22,520
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, maximum, maximum, dose, good, more more things to do now, we have just wrecked your crappy money for this new years of spending time for a new forever, our60stum announced and have takenndom the�� of beanie in the future, we've got excess silk and only new cases shown to these things, no electricity and no amount of care and more weapons.

367
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,460
It's just the same truckering.

368
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:35,460
I don't know what you have to be at me, I don't know what you have to be at me

369
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,460
I don't know what you have to be at me, I don't know what you have to be at me

370
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,460
I reckon it is a year old, but all the division is a lot of people

371
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:48,460
Curiosity is a route, we're selling records to a totally different audience

372
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:54,460
That nobody else has asked, I stick up my album, I made two versions, two versions

373
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
The first amendment against freedom was speaks

374
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,460
To what you say and it didn't include me

375
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
I like the party and have a good time

376
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,460
There's nothing but pleasure written in our rhymes

377
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,460
I love you, don't think you'll ever quit

378
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,460
We got some people on our side, we'll take your lip

379
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
We're gonna do all the things we wanna do

380
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,460
You can't stack the sea, I'd probably get as rich as you

381
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,460
This is the 90's that we're coming on score

382
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,460
Same thing to doing things that you'll say is wrong

383
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,460
Wising up, because on election day

384
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,460

00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,460
We'll see who's banned, that you had to say

456
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,460
We'll see who's banned, that you had to say

457
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,460
We'll see who's banned, that you had to say

458
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,460
We'll see who's banned, that you had to say

459
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,460
We'll see who's banned, that you had to say

460
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:13,460
We'll see who's banned, that you had to say

461
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,460
We'll see who's banned, that you had to say

462
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,460
We'll have to say who's banned, that you had to say

463
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,460
We'll see who's banned, that you had to say

464
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,460
We'll see who's banned, that you had to say

465
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,460
We'll see who's banned, that you had to say

466
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:32,100
I say, which is another one of those great songs that really belongs on the soundtrack

467
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
to our lives.

468
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:38,380
I'm so privileged to be able to share these songs with you, despite legalities and you

469
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,380
just put that aside, just listening to these lyrics.

470
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,060
This is the great thing, of course, if you've downloaded this and you're listening to it

471
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:49,700
on your iPod or on your computer, I mean, you can go back.

472
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,540
You can listen to the song again, listen to those lyrics, listen to what we're saying

473
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,540
as Americans.

474
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,460
I understand this a lot better.

475
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,300
And by the way, you know, we take a lot of heat.

476
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,860
We take a lot of heat for a lot of stuff and there's a lot of reasons for it.

477
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:08,340
And reasons I don't even need to get into because we can have very long and very interesting

478
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:13,900
debates about America's size and what they mean is a superpower or maybe even a former

479
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:19,700
superpower, but there is just one thing I want to point out and Billy Joel will help

480
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,980
me do it.

481
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:46,980
And that all our fucking fault, though, okay?

482
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,700
Harry Truman, Doris Day, Red, China, Johnny Ray, Suffin, Zippin, Baltimore,

483
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,500
Switzerland, Jordan, Matthew, John McCon, the originates in a suit and they can tell

484
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,060
a mission or a mission or a mission, a mission, a mission, a mission, a mission, a mission,

485

00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:58,060
Hi, yeah, yeah, Billy Joe, love that.

501
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,060
Well, I hope you're enjoying being a part of the world's largest

502
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,060
fourth of July picnic with a word from another

503
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,060
fine American invention.

504
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:11,060
This summer, when you buy Coke, you get music.

505
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:15,060
You can win an iPod or free songs on iTunes.

506
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,060
Exactly. Enjoy your American-made Coke on your American-made iPod.

507
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,060
Well, of course, that's incorrect.

508
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,060
We make invent-grade products and then have other countries make them.

509
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:30,060
Sometimes under horrible circumstances and conditions.

510
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,060
Ah, we're a fine bunch, aren't we?

511
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,060
Port City PD, the number one online police drama series,

512
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,060
is now available.

513
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,060
Subscribe now and get the entire first season on your iPod

514
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,060
and get ready for an action-packed season two,

515
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,060
coming July 2007.

516
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,060
Portcity.podshow.com.

517
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,060
Yeah, okay, I got another song for you.

518
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,060
Hold on a second.

519
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,060
This, okay, I only got to do two more, all right?

520
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,060
Because we all got better things to do on this fourth of July.

521
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,060
Hopefully you've been playing this podcast loud and proud

522
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,060
and enjoying the music.

523
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,060
I'll take a little bit of relish on my hot dog, please.

524
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,060
No matter how you express yourself,

525
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,060
no matter what you want to dance to,

526
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,060
it's country and western.

527
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,060
If it's R&B, if it's soul, if it's hip hop,

528
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,060
if it's a trance or house or trip hop,

529
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,060
really one thing that all Americans have in common.

530
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,060
And this is really, this is really,

531
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,060
and you go to any American party,

532
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,060
which is basically, you get a boom box,

533
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,060
you get some crisps,

534
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,060
or as we would call them potato chips,

535
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:40,060
as you get a cake of beer,

536
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,060
and you got yourself an American party.

537
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,060
You know why?

538
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,060
Because all we really want to do,

539
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,060
all that Americans lust for.

540
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:54,060
All that we really live for,

541
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,060
is the ability to rock.

542
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:06,060
Come on, everybody.

543
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,060
Grab that hot dog.

544
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,060
Like that firecracker out of your ass,

545
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,060
and let's all host and take it with you backstage.

546
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:26,060
Come from the cities in the common,

547
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,060
from the smaller towns,

548
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,060
and beat up cars with guitars and drummers go,

549
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,060
crack, boom, the band.

550
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,060
All of a city in the USA,

551
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:42,060
all of a city in the USA,

552
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,060
all of a city in the USA.

553
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,060
Yeah.

554
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,060
And back at it at USA.

555
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,060
The city, the battle, the family,

556
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,060
like it, the battle, the friends.

557
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:04,060
And with the popians in the haze and their little money in the hands.

558
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,060
Some more practice, some more wine.

559
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,060
And you've managed to find a floor to an egg.

560
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,060
The 9th Baby Jesus, you know that thing just mine.

561
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,060
We're getting into the USA.

562
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:44,060
We're swung away from the large town.

563
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,060
We'll lie here for the dreams,

564
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,060
and do not worry about that now.

565
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:58,060
We're swung away from the large town.

566
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,060
We'll lie here for the dreams,

567
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,060
and I'll wear her off the ground.

568
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:09,060
We're swung away from the small town.

569
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,060
We'll lie here for the dreams,

570
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,060
and do not worry about that now.

571
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,060
We're swung away from the large town.

572
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,060
We'll lie here for the dreams,

573
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,060
and do not worry about that now.

574
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,060
We're swung by the sea.

575
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:30,060
All of a city,

576
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,060
upon.

577
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,060
Only I say.

578
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,060
Only I say.

579
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,060
Only I say.

580
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,060
Only I say.

581
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,060
Only I say.

582
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,060
Only I say.

583
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,060
Only I say.

584
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,060
All I say.

585
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,060
John Mellingcamp.

586
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,060
Or back in the day, John Cougar Mellingcamp.

587
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:50,060
ROCK in the USA, almost at the end of the special 4th of July, celebratory Podcast,

588
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,060
a Potcio production.

589
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:59,060
Wh...there is, of course, one other song that I just can't get away with, not playing, on the 4th of July.

590
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:03,780
written by two friends of mine, Dan Hartman and Charlie Midnight.

591
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:09,780
Dan unfortunately is no longer with us, but I'm sure he'd be tickled to know that this whole podcast

592
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:16,100
thing happened and people independently all over the world creating media and playing his music

593
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:24,180
he would dig it. Another American original who did not get the prophecy deserved upon his passing

594
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:32,180
push to side by another American original and a close myth. It is the godfather of soul, my godny,

595
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,180
James Brown has been a better man!

596
00:47:54,180 --> 00:48:04,180
It's something, wait, you must try not to you out!

597
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:12,180
I don't know, it's in this room!

598
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:20,180
Henry, I'm called the nation!

599
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,180
God, you have a shallow picture!

600
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:28,180
Rock my soul!

601
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,180
Ah!

602
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,180
Push it!

603
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,180
That back!

604
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,180
Mid-and-mouth!

605
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,180
A real track!

606
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,180
All night!

607
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,180
Radio!

608
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,180
All night is true!

609
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,180
Don't walk in the rain so hard!

610
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,180
All night, Dan!

611
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,180
You're awake!

612
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,180
All night, call me!

613
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,180
And I heart of pain!

614
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,180
What am I to do?

615
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,180
What am I to do?

616
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,180
What am I to do?

617
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,180
What am I to do?

618
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:10,180
Oh! But that's when I get up and go!

619
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,180
So, I don't know, it's in this room!

620
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:18,180
So, you'll know where you're going!

621
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,180
I know, it's in this room!

622
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,180
It's in this room!

623
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,180
What's in this room?

624
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,180
So, you'll know where you're going!

625
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,180
God, you have a shallow picture!

626
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,180
Oh!

627
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,180
Ah!

628
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,180
You're in America!

629
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:40,180
Well, well, well, that's where it ends!

630
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,180
You may not be looking farther from a flame,

631
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,180
but you might not even wait!

632
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:50,180
I know what it's like!

633
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,180
Oh, but well!

634
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:56,180
When you live, you may not be looking farther from a flame,

635
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,180
but you might not be in a flame!

636
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,180
I know what it's like!

637
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,180
Oh, but well, well, well...

638
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,180
That's where I live!

639
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,180
She got it, yeah

640
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,180

00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,180
She got it, yeah

666
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,180
She got it, yeah

667
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,180
She got it, yeah

668
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,180
She got it, yeah

669
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:45,180
She got it, yeah

670
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,180
She got it, yeah

671
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,180

She got it, yeah

680
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,180
She got it, yeah

681
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:17,300
I always feel it's good to hear Dan's breathless bass on the bit of America.

682
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:38,300
Yeah, sum it up for James.

683
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,300
I'd be a good.

684
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,300
Exactly.

685
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:48,300
I hope you do as well, happy birthday America.

686
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,300
Yeah, that's really all I wanted to say.

687
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,300
Oh boy.

688
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,300
All right.

689
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,300
Just like I've got like a million things going through my mind.

690
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,300
I could keep going.

691
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,300
I could do it three hours show.

692
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,300
I could just keep pulling up songs and we'd have a good time.

693
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,300
However, less is more I'm told.

694
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:07,300
Tomorrow will be back to business with the daily source code with all kinds of crap.

695
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,300
That's already streaming in.

696
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,300
So have yourselves a great day in the United States.

697
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,300
Everyone else in the rest of the world enjoy your day as well.

698
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,300
In fact, as we'd say, in America, you know, what the hell take the rest of the day off.

699
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,300
Another pod show podcast.

700
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,300
Stick it in your ear.
