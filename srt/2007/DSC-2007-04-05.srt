Delta, Serator, daily source code, five, seven, seven.

6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,440
A $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,440
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,440
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:01:01,440
I'm just thinking it's a curry.

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:14,440
If you're pissed off, like old nylon, you might feel better if you get pissed off.

11
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:26,440
If you're all tanks, like CSB, just relax.

12
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:33,440
And on zip, on zip with me, you're in trap-ball.

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:40,440
On a new curry, scalded out at this day, you're in trap-ball.

14
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:49,440
On a new curry, scalded out at this day.

15
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:59,440
To this house, a bed of goods.

16
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:07,440
If you shot you in the head, just like John Wiltberg.

17
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,440
So just relax.

18
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,440
And don't stop screaming.

19
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:22,440
It's about about to start screaming.

20
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,440
You're in trap-ball.

21
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,440
On a new curry, scalded out at this day.

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,440
You're in trap-ball.

23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,440
On a new curry, scalded out at this day.

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,440
You're in trap-ball.

25
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:54,440
On a new curry, scalded out at this day.

26
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,440
On a new curry, scalded out at this day.

27
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,440
On a new curry, scalded out at this day.

28
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:13,440
Ah, thank you.

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Mark Yoshimura Nympha for the...

30
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,440
You're in trouble, son.

31
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Okay.

32
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Golden shower Thursday, Mark.

33
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:35,440
Everybody, it's Daily Source Code 577 coming to you from the curry condo in San Francisco, Northern, California.

34
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Hangin' out.

35
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
This is disgusting.

36
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
It's okay.

37
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Golden showers are fine as long as you're business sitting down.

38
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,440
It's Thursday morning for most of the world.

39
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Of course, California, someone behind the times has always in the weird time zone.

40
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
It is early for me right now.

41
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,440
It's 11.15 pm on Wednesday evening.

42
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,440
So I'm kind of moving to Thursday already.

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,440
I had another fantastic day here in San Fran after a horrible night.

44
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
I don't know.

45
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Of course, you heard yesterday show and you heard my frustrations and shit breaking all over the place.

46
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,440
And then after I finally salvaged the file from Casplaster, which just would not save it properly,

47
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,440
it failed to upload to the podcast, delivery network and I had, well, we have 24 hours.

48
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,440
We have our guys up 24 hours a day now.

49
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,440
So I was able to get a hold of somebody and turned out that something had burped at just the moment.

50
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
I was uploading and all this stuff is going on.

51
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
And it was not very pretty.

52
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,440
So of course, so the show didn't get uploaded until the morning,

53
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
PST.

54
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
So it was late.

55
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
I don't even know when you guys listen to the show.

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,440
Because I released it at such a different time.

58
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
So maybe you're just to get in your day started.

59
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,440
Maybe you've already had your full day and I hope you had a good one.

60
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,440
I got to tell you this, there's something.

61
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,440
I have a problem, a physical problem that I haven't told you guys about.

62
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,440
There's been building up over the past week.

63
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,440
And I might as well tell you because, well, it'll make me feel better if I talk about it

64
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
because I hate it.

65
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,440
And it's, this makes a sound a lot worse than it is.

66
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,440
And I don't like what I have to do to fix it.

67
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,440
You know what tennis elbow is?

68
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,440
I think I've also heard of skateboard ankle, but you know,

69
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:30,440
if you, if you somehow if you overuse your arm and I guess your elbow and other joints while playing

70
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,440
too much tennis, then you can develop tennis elbow, which is the equivalent.

71
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Well, you know, it's, and it hurts and it can even swell up and it can probably be you from playing.

72
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,440
I have something that I've had twice before in my life in the past seven years.

73
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,440
And, and I'm equating it to tennis elbow because I have headphone earlobe.

74
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Yeah, okay, I'll wait until you pick yourself up off of the floor.

75
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,440
My right earlobe is something.

76
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Whenever I'm using headphones excessively, and of course, I really be doing a lot of production.

77
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
How did the headphones on?

78
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Really tight for long periods of time.

79
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,440
Been wearing them. And of course, extremely tight air tight headphones in in the Delta share.

80
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,440
I want to, you know, flying around.

81
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
What happens is my earlobe.

82
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,440
It's like there's an infection like an abscess, I guess, inside my right earlobe.

83
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
And it grows and it starts to swell up.

84
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,440
And the only thing that that can fix it is I have to go to the doctor.

85
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,440
And they have to cut it open and it basically let all the gunk out.

86
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
And then it's over.

87
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,440
And then, you know, then I feel fine. And I wear a bandaid for a day or two.

88
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,440
But it's, you know, it's that build up. I know it's coming.

89
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,440
I know, and it's, you know, starting to like, it feels like my ear is glowing.

90
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,440
And of course, whenever I put headphones on, it's a million times worse.

91
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Anyway, so this afternoon, just this evening before we left,

92
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
I asked Rosie find a doctor for me.

93
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,440
You can do this because it's going to get really bad.

94
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,440
And, uh, yes, headphone earlobe.

95
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
It exists.

96
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
And I have it.

97
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Adam, hey, this is Mark Kelser and Hollywood California right now.

98
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,440
And I'm listening to five, seven, six.

99
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,440
And, uh, I got to tell you, uh, listening to cruise box.

100
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,440
I heard it on a podcast, that podcast song.

101
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
It brought back some memories.

102
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,440
You know, I've been listening to podcasts for a long time.

103
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440
And, uh, and I got to give you a major compliment.

104
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
So, call it kiss your ass or whatever.

105
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,440
But, you know, you've done it.

106
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
You haven't podcasted it.

107
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Um, you've got the same energy the same drive.

108
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Um, and, uh, my hats off to you.

109
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,440
I, I listen, I kind of listen to you.

110
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,440
And then I come back and I, you know, after a while, and I listen to you again.

111
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,440
And you, you, uh, that energy is just amazing.

112
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
So, uh, we've come a long way.

113
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
I mean podcasting has come a long way.

114
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,440
And I'm looking at all these people in Hollywood right now on the streets.

115
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,440
And now I want to, you know, be something famous.

116
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,440
And, uh, I wonder how many people really want to do that work once they become famous.

117
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
You know, it's hard work.

118
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
And, uh, congratulations, dude.

119
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,440
And all the best to you and all those people out there that are getting people like me to listen and watch.

120
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
I really appreciate it.

121
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Oh, Mark, thank you.

122
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,440
I was waiting for a folder of scruncher tagline there.

123
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Uh, Mark, thanks for calling it and appreciate that.

124
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
That's really nice of you to say.

125
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Yeah, it's consistency.

126
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Uh, it's not hard to do though.

127
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,440
I tell you every single day, no matter what time of day I'm always excited about doing the show because first of all,

128
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,440
every one of my life knows I'm doing the show so that leave me alone.

129
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
And it's like, hey, doing a show.

130
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
So just let him be.

131
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,440
So it's nice because I get along fine with myself and my friends here on the Charlie.

132
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,440
And, um, and the stuff you guys send in, it makes it really easy to do.

133
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
It really does.

134
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
And at least for my show, it does.

135
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Yep.

136
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,440
I think, uh, I think we're, we're definitely, uh, we're definitely growing.

137
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Uh, I, in fact, I know we're growing.

138
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,440
We have this, uh, this big, uh, technology move coming up on Friday the 13th.

139
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
So not this Friday, but next Friday.

140
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
And, uh, this is going to be big.

141
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Um, so we're moving into, uh, into our own location.

142
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Um, you know, there's, we're moving on.

143
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,440
We were, uh, we were still, uh, at Rackspace.

144
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Not with our media hosting, but with all our applications.

145
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,440
And, uh, you know, we've had, um,

146
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,440
we've had, uh, experiences where our application brought down all of Rackspace.

147
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
You know, there's just, like, so all of a sudden we'll have a surge of traffic or something happens.

148
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,440
And we really need to, to set ourselves up for us.

149
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,440
You know, not to fail, not to die under success.

150
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,440
So that's happening Friday the 13th and then we've been doing a lot of work, um,

151
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
well, of engineering and operations, of course.

152
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,440
I'm doing a shitload of work to, to, to prepare to get this done.

153
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Um, but on the 13th itself, of course,

154
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
we, you know, it's always prime time somewhere.

155
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
It's always download time somewhere.

156
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
So there's no perfect time to pick, you know,

157
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
you can say middle of the night, but, you know,

158
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
that's next week in Australia.

159
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
And, uh, and yesterday in Hawaii, you know,

160
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,440
it's like, you can't choose a good time Friday.

161
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,440
I think is reasonable because, uh,

162
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,440
uh, that is typically when traffic is the lowest across the board of, uh,

163
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
uh, and all countries, uh, from, you know,

164
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Friday to Saturday and Friday is reasons.

165
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
So, uh, everyone's given up there, uh,

166
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
a good chunk of their weekend, I'm sure.

167
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,440
And we'll, we will be down for several hours,

168
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,440
but we're preparing a lot of stuff,

169
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
uh, behind the scenes look at, uh,

170
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
what's going on, you know,

171
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
just a typical pod show style, you know,

172
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,440
and where my space gives you a Tetris game to play.

173
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Uh, we're going to give you content.

174
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
So, um, uh, before warned,

175
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,440
and you'll be hearing a lot more about this in the coming week,

176
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,440
as, uh, every single show in the network will be aware

177
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
that it's just going to happen.

178
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Of course advertisers, all kinds of people.

179
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
And it's very different from a year ago

180
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,440
when we would relaunch or, or change something.

181
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,440
And we also have, you know,

182
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
changes to the interface coming.

183
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
We're not going to do it all in one go,

184
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,440
but it's going to be, you know, uh,

185
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
day upon day, week upon week and, uh,

186
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
good shit on the way.

187
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Uh, let me see.

188
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Checking the, uh, the Gmail,

189
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Derek Richardson.

190
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Hey, Adam, hope you're well.

191
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Couldn't believe my ears.

192
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Daily source code 575.

193
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Flock a sea girl's awesome.

194
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Mm-hmm.

195
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
And I love that man.

196
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,440
As song was like, uh, 28, 29 almost 30 years old.

197
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,440
You just don't hear that shit on the radio enough.

198
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Speaking of a ran,

199
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Neil Cochran sent me an email.

200
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
And, uh,

201
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
let's see.

202
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Oh, he has a link here, which is probably,

203
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
you know, I'm going to save that.

204
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
You know, there's a, this whole thing about the,

205
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
the soldiers that have been there.

206
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
That have been captured and, uh,

207
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
and arrested, I guess.

208
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
What do you call that?

209
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Um, well, I know what, uh,

210
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
President Bush calls it,

211
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,440
the hostages, um,

212
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
you know, and, uh, the relationship

213
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
between Britain and, uh,

214
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
and Persia or Iran.

215
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
A lot of, a lot of you writing in about that.

216
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
I, I, I may do something next week when I'm, uh,

217
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
when I'm back at the, uh,

218
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
at the manner.

219
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,440
And up, you know, we should really delve into that.

220
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Because there's a lot more,

221
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
behind, you know, this story.

222
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
That's a lot more to it.

223
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
I think that's what Neil was pointing out.

224
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Uh, we see was, uh,

225
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
weird stand of comedy lecturers on TV last year.

226
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Robert Newman's history of oil.

227
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Uh, Robert Newman's a comedian,

228
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
although he's more a political activist,

229
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
as you'll see in the clip.

230
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
You should give it a look as a couple of

231
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
snigger word, snigger.

232
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,440
Snigger word of the parts,

233
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
but it really got me,

234
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
it's really got me thinking.

235
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
Well, you know what?

236
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Let's just have a quick check sewing.

237
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
Let me just open up the, uh,

238
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
the web browser audio port here.

239
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
See if there's any narration.

240
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Robert Newman's history of oil.

241
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
I'll definitely put a link to this in the show notes

242
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
at dailysourcecode.com.

243
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,440
The terrifying 100 year history of oil.

244
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Okay, I'm bored.

245
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
I can hear you are, least.

246
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Anything else in the ran that I want to do today?

247
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,440
Let's see.

248
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
James.

249
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,440
15 sailors and marines captured allegedly in Iranian waters.

250
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,440
14 men, one women.

251
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,440
One woman.

252
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Doesn't take a genius to work out who had the map does it.

253
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
No.

254
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
You're right.

255
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Sex, drugs, and coffee to ho, is a novel.

256
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,440
It's the story of a single week in the summer of 2006.

257
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,440
I'll be reading the 39 chapters as a weekly audio podcast.

258
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,440
A bit like an audio port, right?

259
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
But there's more.

260
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,440
A central figure, the heroine, perhaps,

261
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,440
the catalyst certainly is Alice.

262
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Okay.

263
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,440
I told Jack a lot about last summer.

264
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,440
How strange it was, and he talked to many of the others too.

265
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,440
But shit, I never expected him to write a book about it.

266
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Alice's weekly video blog is her way of thinking back to last summer,

267
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,440
making sense of what happened and changed so many lives,

268
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,440
at least the lives of those who survived.

269
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,440
She was there in July in the South of France.

270
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Sex and drugs and coffee to oil tells her story.

271
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,440
She was there in July in the South of France.

272
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
You weren't.

273
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Or were you?

274
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Watch her video blog.

275
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,440
It's easy to find on BT Podshow or at www.Alice and Paris 2007.

276
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,440
All is one word.com.

277
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,440
You know, those of you have been listening for a while.

278
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
That's Malcolm from Abu Dhabi.

279
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
He's been working on this project for quite a while,

280
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
and it's very interesting, of course,

281
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
only as you would expect Malcolm to do.

282
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,440
If you ever heard Malcolm on the show, he's got this haunting voice,

283
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,440
and he's been in entertainment for a while,

284
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
longer than myself, I might say.

285
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,440
I don't want to put any age on him,

286
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,440
but he's done the music video for David Bowie.

287
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
One of the early ones.

288
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,440
And so this sex and drugs and coffee to hold.

289
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
If I'm pronouncing it correctly,

290
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,440
it's part video blog and it's part audio novel,

291
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
and it's really worth checking out.

292
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,440
So I'll put a link to that in the show, no, says well.

293
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Just all kinds of gems today.

294
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,440
I got a couple of people emailing me this story.

295
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
About this is amazing.

296
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
You have to see the pictures,

297
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,440
because it's going to drive you crazy.

298
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
See, this is Andrew Terry sent me this,

299
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
who else sent me this.

300
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Sinclair, of course.

301
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Under different subject headings,

302
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
one is better run.

303
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,440
They found your old house in Tennessee.

304
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,440
The other one is redefining the term,

305
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
hot hole.

306
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
You're not going to believe this.

307
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Law enforcement officers in Tennessee,

308
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,440
make the greatest underground discovery

309
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,440
since Tutic Ammon's tomb was unearthed

310
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
in the valley of the kings.

311
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Under this ordinary house,

312
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
and this picture of indeed a very ordinary house,

313
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
a marijuana grow up.

314
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
That would be a plantation, I guess.

315
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
Unlike any you've ever seen with caves

316
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
of middle Tennessee,

317
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
growers constructed a complex of offices,

318
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
living quarters, restroom facilities,

319
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
and the climate controlled forest

320
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
of over 1,000 cannabis plants.

321
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
You should see this thing.

322
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
It's like a nuclear shelter,

323
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
only for growing weed,

324
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
and it's beautiful.

325
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,440
And of course,

326
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
it's everything's been confiscated,

327
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
but wow.

328
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
I mean, you can see the technology

329
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,440
that have 150 yard tunnel

330
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,440
that leads to a concealed escape hatch,

331
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,440
blow a hydraulic rock,

332
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
which opens up kind of like something

333
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
from Hogan's heroes.

334
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
You can't crawl underneath the fence.

335
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Only it's hydraulic.

336
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
It's amazing.

337
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
It's just unbelievable.

338
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
I love it.

339
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
All right.

340
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Make sure you check it.

341
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
You're going to love this.

342
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Make sure you check out the link

343
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
at dailysourcecode.com.

344
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Hi.

345
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
I hope this is Adam Puri.

346
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
My name is William I,

347
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
and I'm calling

348
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
because I have a new picture

349
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,440
on patcho.com.

350
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
That I think you would like

351
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
and my Uncle John told me

352
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
to give you a call,

353
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
but you know that I exist.

354
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
So basically what I do

355
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,440
is I go through different genres

356
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,440
every week.

357
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
Postes a plan and take about

358
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
four songs that I really like.

359
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
And then in between that,

360
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
I have co-hosts,

361
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
who are my roommates.

362
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
I'm a college student in California.

363
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
And we talk about dumb things

364
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,440
that are very funny

365
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
like the kids who got

366
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
goals, making of the band

367
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
on TV,

368
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
and we talk about

369
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
our roommate,

370
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
who's an area

371
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
slash a durian and her

372
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
funny ways.

373
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
And how she loves us

374
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
at the animals.

375
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
So I mean,

376
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
it's plain,

377
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
but it's pretty cool.

378
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
So if you took it

379
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,440
a look that would be great.

380
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,440
My URL

381
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440

383
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440

384
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440

I, L, L, E.

388
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
Quite a minute.

389
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
This is the prolific program

390
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
or school of URL linkage.

391
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
Let's do that again.

392
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Just in case anyone wants

393
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,440
to write it down.

394
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,440
If you took it a look

395
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
that would be great.

396
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
My URL

397
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440

402
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
or

403
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
William I, L, I, A, M, A,

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
and I. Partial.com

405
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
And also

406
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
I am a school nurse,

407
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
not a school nurse.

408
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
Thanks so much.

409
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Did your uncle

410
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
young tell you to say

411
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
that when you called

412
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
him?

413
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Hmm.

414
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Okay.

415
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,440
I'll put that link in the show notes as well.

416
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,440
I actually had to listen to that three times to write

417
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
the URL.

418
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
But it's, it's great.

419
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
A nice podcast.

420
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,440
You and your girlfriend, I guess, do that.

421
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
I'd like your gallery on your,

422
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
on your podshow plus page as well.

423
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
I love the one of the two of you

424
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,440
in, in the, in the pool.

425
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,440
Didn't uncle young mention

426
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,440
that sending naked pictures

427
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,440
is very good for your downloads?

428
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,440
So, um, three campaigns

429
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,440
have ended of sponsors of this show.

430
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,440
They'll be renewing the next run,

431
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
I guess, um,

432
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,440
as you know, advertisers don't advertise

433
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
20, you know, 12 months a year.

434
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,440
They, they, they, they time it with product

435
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,440
releases and all kinds of multi, multi

436
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
dimensional, uh, initiatives.

437
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,440
God, that sounded very advertising like

438
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
didn't it?

439
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Uh, so Splenda Folgers and what else?

440
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
There was another one that ended.

441
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
Uh, anyway, so we have a whole slew of new ones

442
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
coming up, at least on this show.

443
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Uh, it's different on every show on the network.

444
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
But I think we've got, uh,

445
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
what do we have?

446
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
We have cover girl coming.

447
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
We've got, uh, Paramount.

448
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
Oh, we got an awesome show

449
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
where we're working on with Paramount, uh,

450
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,440
p360.

451
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
It'll be from the back lot of Paramount studios.

452
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
I'm really looking forward to that.

453
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,440
That's part of what we're going to be doing in Los Angeles.

454
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,440
Um, is, uh, is doing some pre-production on that?

455
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Uh, what else is coming?

456
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Shit, I don't know, man.

457
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm fried.

458
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,440
I did get some interesting feedback about, uh,

459
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
advertisers on the daily source code, which, uh,

460
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
uh, I don't agree with, but hey,

461
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
it's a golden shower Thursday.

462
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
I had them.

463
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
This is Alexander from Stockholm.

464
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
Uh, I called you last week about

465
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,440
sending the receipts for the Bumnush,

466
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
the chart purchase.

467
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Um, yeah, by the way, uh,

468
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
it's time to choose a winner, isn't it?

469
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Uh, uh, I got to ask, uh,

470
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
I got to find out exactly how we're going to do that,

471
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,440
but I have a ton of receipts.

472
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Uh, excuse me,

473
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Tylenol TM.

474
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
It'll help you sleep.

475
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Good for chicks.

476
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Uh, I can't wait to send this off to Tylenol.

477
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
They're going to love it.

478
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Uh, what was I saying?

479
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,440
Yeah, this is from Bumnush, the charts.

480
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Okay.

481
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
So I got your receipt.

482
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
I've got all of them.

483
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
We're going to be doing the drawing.

484
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
I guess we'll do that next week when I get everything organized.

485
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,440
I'm in New Yorker in Stockholm, Sweden,

486
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,440
and I guess my BSE handle would be

487
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,440
the new Sweden or something like that.

488
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Anyway, I wanted to say something about

489
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
Splendent and Folgers.

490
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Um, I'm a huge fan of your show and of what you're doing.

491
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
And, uh,

492
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,440
the production of your show and, um,

493
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,440
and, um, it seems that just about everything in your life

494
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
is very high quality.

495
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
And, uh,

496
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,440
you enjoy, you know, uh,

497
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,440
virgin upper class and your airplane and, uh,

498
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Patricia seems to, uh, really, uh,

499
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
enjoy the finer things in life here.

500
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
But, um,

501
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,440
now that you've, uh, ended your contract

502
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,440
apparently with Splendent and Folgers,

503
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
I have to say that, uh,

504
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
those are both very, uh,

505
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
to, uh, to me, um,

506
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
poor, uh,

507
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
product and poor quality.

508
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
Um, now you see,

509
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
this is where, uh,

510
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
at first I'm like,

511
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
okay, it's pretty interesting.

512
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Guy wants a handle.

513
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
He's the new sweet.

514
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,440
He's getting into stuff.

515
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
He's been listening and,

516
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
and he under clearly understands

517
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
my level of sophistication in life.

518
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
And, uh,

519
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,440
and now he's saying that these are poor products.

520
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Uh,

521
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
I can hear coffee drinkers everywhere going.

522
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Uh,

523
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,440
I completely agree with the coffee roaster

524
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
that called in the other day saying that,

525
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
you know,

526
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,440
coffee goes stale after

527
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
what did he say 14 days?

528
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
There's something like that, huh?

529
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,440
And also Splendent.

530
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
I mean,

531
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
what's going on?

532
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
It's, it's like, uh,

533
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
it's like,

534
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,440
a chemical that tastes like sugar.

535
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,440
I mean,

536
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
technically not correct.

537
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
It is actually made from sugar.

538
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
If you would really pay attention to the,

539
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
uh,

540
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,440
to the conversation about it,

541
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
then you would have known that.

542
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
It's not just,

543
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
it's not a chemical.

544
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Mm-hmm.

545
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
It's all bunch of chemicals.

546
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
But it's made from sugar,

547
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
and it really works and tastes good.

548
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Sugar would be a better thing,

549
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
because it's a natural,

550
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
you know,

551
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
grown product from nature,

552
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
but sake sugar,

553
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
chemically,

554
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
you know,

555
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
well,

556
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
you know what I'm saying.

557
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
Anyway,

558
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
Yeah.

559
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,440
I think that a,

560
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
um,

561
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
a show like yours should choose

562
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,440
if sponsors more carefully,

563
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
I think.

564
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Now,

565
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
this is,

566
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
now I really got interested by this,

567
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,440
because one thing is very clear

568
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
to the new sweet,

569
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
is that I'm choosing my sponsors.

570
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
I'm glad you,

571
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
you feel that that is,

572
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
I mean,

573
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
you don't,

574
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
I guess you don't,

575
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
didn't even think about it.

576
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
You just saying it as if it's fact.

577
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
And it is true.

578
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,440
Um,

579
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,440
And I think I've said many times before.

580
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
You're going to see advertisers,

581
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
probably auditioning to be on,

582
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
on certain programs,

583
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
on maybe on any program.

584
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
For that matter.

585
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
Um,

586
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
and,

587
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
there are,

588
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
man,

589
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
there's,

590
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
there's lots of sponsorships

591
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
and advertisements that I turn down for this show.

592
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Um,

593
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I'll give an example.

594
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
I won't name exactly which company,

595
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
but I will tell you,

596
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
a company,

597
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
an oil company.

598
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
And I turned it down.

599
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
I said,

600
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
no, thank you.

601
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
You know,

602
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
and they advertise on the network on other shows,

603
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
that we're all,

604
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
you know,

605
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,440
all to happy to endorse the product or their initiative,

606
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
which actually wasn't,

607
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
wasn't bad at all,

608
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
but I just like,

609
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
I don't feel like I should,

610
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
you know,

611
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
I'm more about independence.

612
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Um,

613
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
So in fact,

614
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,440
there is a form of auditioning happening already.

615
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
I'm sorry,

616
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,440
a serious satellite radio listeners.

617
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
I'll be back again

618
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,440
for the Fubar Friday festivities Friday night.

619
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
You take care now.

620
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
I'm a big fan of the live,

621
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
blah, blah, blah, blah.

622
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,440
So really,

623
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
it's,

624
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,440
it's very close to what you're talking about.

625
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Um,

626
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
now advertising,

627
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
of course,

628
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
for me,

629
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,440
and the type of advertising we do,

630
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
which is not,

631
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
you know,

632
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
ad words or,

633
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
you know,

634
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Google,

635
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
like relevancy track stuff,

636
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
you know,

637
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
it's only going to work if I think I,

638
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
you know,

639
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
this can appeal to each individual audience.

640
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
By the way,

641
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
we turned down lots of advertisers,

642
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,440
not interested in because we want brand advertising.

643
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,440
And brand advertising is about awareness and getting you to try something.

644
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
So,

645
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
um,

646
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
even though I was not a Fulger's coffee drinker,

647
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,440
I was more than happy to try it and talk about it

648
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
for the run of the campaign.

649
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
Same for Splenda.

650
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Now,

651
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
I continue to use Fulgers.

652
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
Um,

653
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
okay,

654
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
I'm kind of cheating because I use Fulger's instant coffee,

655
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
which,

656
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
I don't know,

657
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
the taste is good to me.

658
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
So,

659
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
you know,

660
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
it's,

661
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
it's enrich my life in that way.

662
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
And for lots of people,

663
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
and they've talked about it,

664
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
and they've sent in comments,

665
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
same,

666
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
and for some,

667
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
it doesn't,

668
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
which is okay,

669
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
but to call it,

670
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
you know,

671
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,440
not upscale or downscale or not at my scale,

672
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
that just doesn't make any sense.

673
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
That,

674
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
your sponsors should be,

675
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
you know,

676
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Jaguar,

677
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
like your car,

678
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
um,

679
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
I can't.

680
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
No,

681
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
they don't have to pay me.

682
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
I'll endorse their car for free.

683
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
The bird,

684
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
what your airplane is.

685
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
It's.

686
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
That's what they're.

687
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
One, eight, two.

688
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
The ground here,

689
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,440
airplane.

690
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,440
Oh, again, you know,

691
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
I'll fly,

692
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
fly and talk about it for free.

693
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
No problem.

694
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
No,

695
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
I would say.

696
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
It's not new to me.

697
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
You see,

698
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
I know that stuff.

699
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
So it's not that exciting to me.

700
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,440
And now,

701
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
no.

702
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
No.

703
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Hey,

704
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
you're more of a,

705
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
you know,

706
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
magnum champagne.

707
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Please.

708
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Uh,

709
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
show then, uh,

710
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
I'm a dude.

711
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
I don't drink.

712
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
Please,

713
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
produce,

714
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
take sugar.

715
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
So,

716
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
um,

717
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
that's what I think.

718
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
Choose your sponsors more carefully.

719
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
Because they reflect on you,

720
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
and pod show,

721
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
and everything you do.

722
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
Thank you.

723
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
