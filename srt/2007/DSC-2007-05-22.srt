1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Another pod-show pod-cast.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,440
Stick!

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,240
We interrupt the show for a special announcement from Pod-show HQ.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,720
Attention pod-casters, viewers and listeners.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,120
Pod-show needs you to help us suck the lads.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,120
Help us suck the lads.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,720
Help us suck the lads.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,040
Pod-show needs you to help us suck the lads.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,920
Hi, it's John and Drew from the Don and Drew Show.

We're always trying to improve in this time we need you to help us suck the lads.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,560
We're creating a special place for Pod-show's sub-less zone at sub-less.cojo.com.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,960
That's right, once you're there, you can join our super-pan.

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,240
Give us your feedback, earn points, and get valuable stuff.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,840
It's fun, it's easy, and most of all, you help us suck the lads.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Help us suck the lads.

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,080
Help us suck the lads.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,280
Pod-show needs you to help us suck the lads.

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,520
Now, back to the show.

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,680
Hey, Adam, just wanted to say that we're all behind you on your new smoke-free life.

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,000
But during the DSC606, if you happen to flake out, make sure you're turned to your right

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,560
and aim it towards Jersey Todd.

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,920
Now, I'm moving here on the left and, you know, JT knows a lot of good ambulance drivers,

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,800
so he's got a on a first name basis, he'll be taking care of, but anyway, don't want to make

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
you paranoid.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
It's okay.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Take it easy, man.

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
DSC606.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Stay focused.

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,720
All right, everybody, how you doing?

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,800
It's Tuesday, and it's time to fly to Germany.

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,880
To, uh, darmstot to be exact, let me just get out of the driveway and wait goodbye

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,880
to my lovely wife.

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,880
You?

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,880
Hi, baby.

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,880
Love you.

37
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,880
All right.

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Oh, I want to just grab my T here.

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,880
It's in the cup holder, but a little bit too full.

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,080
Uh, so, yes, indeed.

41
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:42,600
This is a daily source code, episode six, zero, six, and let me just, oops, we have kind

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,840
of a funky, uh, blind spot driveway, so, there we go.

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Right, too.

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:59,280
Um, so the plan is, hopefully, uh, the equipment is holding up and you can hear me, okay?

45
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,560
I think, uh, the first stop before we get to the airfield will be at the gas station to

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,560
pick up some new batteries.

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,320
Let me see where I'm going to go today.

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,720
I'll just follow the road.

49
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,040
I go the, the inside track, which takes us up over the, uh, up over the hills of the

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,600
west side of G-town.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,080
Yeah, so I need some batteries for the, for the wireless setup, but, uh, I know idea how much

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,360
this juice is still left in them, but in order to make sure that we can, uh, record as much

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,560
of the trip as possible, which, of course, will be performed, uh, partially solo, uh, taking

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,920
off at, uh, pharaohs, if you're looking for that on any type of aviation, database or map,

55
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,720
it's echo golf, tango, fox, trot, flying to rotted am over the channel today.

56
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,040
Now the weather here, which would be the Heathrow and Gatwick weather, is spectacular.

57
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,880
There are some clouds at about 3000 feet, but where there's no clouds, it's, uh, blue skies,

58
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,640
uh, right now it's, uh, 17 degrees Celsius, external.

59
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,120
So, I think this microphone is starting to slip already, because of the low, uh, battery

60
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
hold on.

61
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:24,360
Uh, now, since I've never been, I've never flown in German airspace at all, um, although

62
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,760
apparently it's all supposed to kind of be the same, and procedures are all supposed to

63
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,480
kind of work in the same manner.

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:37,000
I decided to pick up a safety pilot, his name is Yos, I'll be picking him up at a rotted

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,080
am airport, and together we'll make the trip to, it's only, uh, it's only probably about

66
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,840
the same distance as, uh, as it is from here to rotted am.

67
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,160
So I'm a rotted am's about halfway, and we're going to, uh, Eagle Buck airport, uh,

68
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,960
which is right underneath Frankford International, and it's actually quite nice because, uh,

69
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:06,680
we got some meetings tomorrow in Darmstadt, and, uh, Eagle, Eagle, echo, echo delta fox echo,

70
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,440
mmf.

71
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,360
Flux, graven, eagle, whatever, uh, what's this?

72
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:32,360
This is a message from, um,

73
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,300
so your put show company is coming to Germany,

74
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:34,440
forustcania,

75
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,160
to Germany. Well, I have been living in various German-speaking countries, so here's a

76
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:50,840
crash course in German. Okay, great. My name is Kerry. My name is Kerry, and not a

77
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,280
Kerry sausage, which is a very popular in German, a kind of sausage. Okay. The voter

78
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,920
is in the loop, the vector, glass, to me, and also in the starting scene. What is a quote from

79
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,800
getter, which is actually in the literature, like German Shakespeare kind, and it means

80
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,840
Turkish cheap, let's see, some dates. Okay, that's a good one.

81
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Excuse me? Yep. Yes, it comes. That piece of this are strong. What means of course?

82
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Fuck you asshole. You're not a yo.

83
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,760
Oh my goodness, CSB, you just weigh too much from a man fantastic. So I'm going to do

84
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:49,960
as, of course, this entire show is going to be chopped up. Oh, comic strip. The goodness just

85
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,080
keeps on coming. I'm going to edit the entire show down to something a little reasonable, and of

86
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:03,320
course, you know, I got a lot of talking to do with air traffic control, and then maybe I'll be able to

87
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,840
talk a little bit about what's going on. We'll see, I don't think I've actually done this solo yet.

88
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,160
No, I don't think I have a certainly not across the channel that we've actually recorded it. So a good old

89
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,320
fashion sound seeing tour for sure then. Let me pick up some new batteries, and I'll talk to you in

90
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:31,960
just a sec. Just a short break, and we're back. Fresh batteries installed should be fine

91
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,080
for the rest of the trip to Rotterdam at least, and I'm just rolling up here

92
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:45,960
at Farrowks Airfield. It looks pretty busy today. See, what do we have on the field? Some

93
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:59,000
just pretty much going to get on with business, and you guys, oh by the way, if when I'm

94
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,200
running through this on the edit, it's just too boring. I'll roll in some songs here and there.

95
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:14,520
So activity at the airfield. This is Farrowks. It is Tuesday the 22nd of May 2007.

96
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,560
Enjoy the morning at the airfield.

97
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,200
See, it looks like it can actually take everything all in one go.

98
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,880
Quite a lot of stuff waiting today.

99
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:50,440
Let's go on to the apron. Oops. I shit this falling out of my bag.

100
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,840
I'm not looking too professional.

101
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,240
See, it's my aircraft out.

102
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:08,280
Yeah. So it should be out and ready for full fuel. Morning.

103
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:25,720
We're now on the tarmac walking past the hangers. There's a piper warming up.

104
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,800
It's a jet ranger in the air.

105
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:50,520
The plenty of aircraft are out and positioned today, and it's where the looks just beautiful.

106
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Okay, with the piper, should really go.

107
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,200
Enough already. It's warm, dude.

108
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:21,320
Yeah, here we go.

109
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, this is the luggage hatch.

110
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:42,040
Oh, look at the main cabin door.

111
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,280
Hello. Hello, lovely airplane.

112
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,520
I think the timing of my flight today is so perfect.

113
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,960
Morning, and you done the fuel?

114
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:14,440
Fantastic. Thanks a lot, mate. I ordered it special.

115
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,960
Please don't say no to your door.

116
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,160
It's good.

117
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,980
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.

118
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:49,360
Okay, this is by the last time I'm going to be talking to you guys until I'm

119
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:58,360
comfortable with where I'm at over the, over the route okay, just

120
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
strapping in.

121
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Alrighty, we have a comms on.

122
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:23,360
One, two, three, four, two, five, one, two, five, five corrects.

123
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
We just got my flight plan.

124
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,360
They've got on my dancing knee pad, which we've talked about.

125
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Okay, and a boost.

126
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Go to the flight plan and you activate.

127
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Hey, nice.

128
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,360
We have a off go, one, one, five, three.

129
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm going to put.

130
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Okay, our comms are already in the other boxes.

131
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Wow.

132
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:09,360
So, being down the RPM, just missed it to that.

133
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,360
All right.

134
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Let's make our out here anything on frequency.

135
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,360
So, no one's doing anything, I guess.

136
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:28,360
That's number two, seven, seven, down the share in good morning.

137
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Number two, one, zero, two, one, two, four, one, zero, two, four, one, zero.

138
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,360
So, I want zero, two, two, is that what you said?

139
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Okay, we've got a beautiful day.

140
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,360
Okay, thanks, Jason.

141
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Okay, one, zero, two, two, and one, taxi.

142
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
Brakes off.

143
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Everything spits.

144
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm making sure.

145
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
All right.

146
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Let's move here.

147
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,360
I've got the window open.

148
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Because it's heat up.

149
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
And, oh gee, I don't have an air conditioning.

150
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,360
I will actually pre-open up my vents.

151
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,360
All right, wish you guys could see this.

152
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Even more fun, we have the visual of it.

153
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,360
And I'm just taxiing.

154
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Last, the bum house,

155
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,360
where the spotters sit, and there's some people I think you have.

156
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Business flights today.

157
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Okay, first stop is,

158
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
proper one,

159
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,360
or the runway two, four.

160
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
Interesting.

161
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
I think there's no wind today.

162
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Yeah, look at the wind sock.

163
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
This zero wind here.

164
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
So, they just chose a direction.

165
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,360
I think that, once we get airborne,

166
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,360
there will be a little bit of headwind.

167
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Okay, so now we're on the long taxiway

168
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,360
to the other end for the,

169
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,360
furry Kernnamo leaf of the three three five south feed ways.

170
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,360
A little bit of branchting over.

171
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
Creepy high found sull一 thumb,

172
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,360
but jumboerheim of the food was raised up to me,

173
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
lovely crownIm هنا.

174
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
By the��mer, no drop and jump by the turn.

175
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
From all my doro,

176
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
we'll turn circuit on h1,0, into two,

177
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,360
okay so this is a little bit of vector.

178
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Cross wind today.

179
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,360
I'm just steering, making sure everything works.

180
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
It looks like it.

181
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Got my hand.

182
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Um, actually it's a cornering tailwind.

183
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,360
That's going to be fun.

184
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
I'm not allowed to do that anymore.

185
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
I'm not allowed to do that anymore.

186
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
I'm not allowed to do that anymore.

187
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,360
I'm not allowed to do that anymore.

188
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,360
Yeah, it's interesting, it's a cornering tailwind.

189
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
Not a lot of wind, maybe.

190
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Five, six, seven knots.

191
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Looking at the, uh, at the wind sock here.

192
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
Um, but still.

193
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Ah.

194
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Porting tailwind.

195
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
You're going to be a little careful with two.

196
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
All right.

197
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
I don't believe myself.

198
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
I'm just holding a plate.

199
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
A little bit more.

200
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
A little bit more.

201
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
A little bit more.

202
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
I can see him.

203
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
I'm in.

204
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Now he's doing that.

205
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Perfect.

206
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
Time for me to.

207
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,360
Do my pre take off checks.

208
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
Hey, so.

209
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,360
I'll take you through him when it closes the window.

210
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,360
First we rubber up to seven first let's check the.

211
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
By controls.

212
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Bring.

213
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,360
All movement free and clear.

214
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
I'll bring in.

215
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
I'm going to do a mag check.

216
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
So bring it up to.

217
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,360
1700 RPM.

218
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
That's the right mag.

219
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
That's the last mag.

220
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,360
Uh, about a hundred RPM drop that's acceptable.

221
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Outgoing the car.

222
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Heat.

223
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Drop some little bit.

224
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
Becking the suction.

225
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
The suction's in the green.

226
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
We're going to recycle the propeller.

227
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Okay.

228
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
We're going to recycle.

229
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
And look at everything else.

230
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
All temperatures and pressures.

231
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Good.

232
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Emeter is running.

233
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
So we're charging.

234
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Blapse.

235
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
One stage.

236
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Okay.

237
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,360
When I take off, which will be.

238
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
On wait two.

239
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Four.

240
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
We want to head.

241
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
We want to head.

242
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
We want to head like that.

243
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
With the green.

244
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Up.

245
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
A one three zero to.

246
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,360
We want to head like that.

247
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
With the green.

248
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
Up.

249
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
A one three zero to.

250
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
A one three zero to.

251
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
Which is our first.

252
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
Navigation point.

253
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Hold on a second.

254
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
I do have to.

255
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
And I don't have to.

256
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
Okay.

257
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
Let's see.

258
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Is this guy coming in yet?

259
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
He's on final.

260
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
But.

261
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
Break off.

262
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Our Pete in.

263
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,360
Blapse one.

264
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
I already had that.

265
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,360
We're good on trim.

266
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,360
He'll select her both.

267
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
And.

268
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,360
I need to.

269
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,360
Plug in the device here.

270
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,360
Perfect.

271
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Okay.

272
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:47,360
He's just landed.

273
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
Oh.

274
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Number seven Delta.

275
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
Yeah.

276
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
Follow one.

277
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Ready.

278
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Come on.

279
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Thanks.

280
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Okay.

281
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
So.

282
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
That other guy is obviously.

283
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
On the runway.

284
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
No.

285
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:11,360
We're going to.

286
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,360
Because this one does also a lot less lift in the air.

287
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,360
Take off my discretion.

288
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
I'm a two seven seven Delta share.

289
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
So you hear that.

290
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,360
We do indeed have a little bit of wind behind us.

291
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,360
So just got to be careful.

292
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:31,360
I'm taking off.

293
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
So ready.

294
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
That's roll.

295
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Pedal to metal.

296
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
And power.

297
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
Okay.

298
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Temperatures.

299
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Pressures.

300
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
All of good air speed indicator is alive.

301
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,360
Very important that we know we have air speed.

302
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
We're 40 knots.

303
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
15 knots.

304
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Need a little bit more.

305
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Yeah.

306
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Okay.

307
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,360
There she goes.

308
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:04,360
And we have positive wind breaks gear up.

309
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
And 200.

310
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,360
Beats.

311
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
300 feet.

312
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
I don't know.

313
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
I don't know.

314
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Come back.

315
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
I don't know.

316
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Bar and feet.

317
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
Flaps up.

318
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Knows up.

319
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
I don't know.

320
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Come back.

321
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
I don't know.

322
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
I don't think so.

323
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Yeah.

324
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
I think.

325
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Now.

326
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Nice.

327
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
Time is all.

328
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,360
If I did, I won't be able to go there.

329
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Right.

330
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
Off the way.

331
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
Yeah.

332
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Perfect.

333
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,360
Yeah.

334
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,360
But just to pop a little bit

335
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Get ready to call Farbrill

336
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
I was like they're a little busy today

00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,360
Farbrill right on November 27 7. Don't the share of light information service

338

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,360
Turned out to 2000 feet

343
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,720
I will jump in

355
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,360
I'll find number 7

356
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,360
And next we're going to go to the local control department.

357
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Digging hill.

358
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
We're just going to wait for time to go.

359
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Welcome to this community.

360
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
I've never looked at it.

361
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
Welcome to this old news.

362
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
And a decommissioned airfield.

363
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
I've never looked at it.

364
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

365
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,360
Okay.

366
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,360
In the climb up, we'll head to 2000 feet.

367
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
Meanwhile, I'm going to set a...

368
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
Digging hill.

369
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

370
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
Hey, why are they going to roll that over there?

371
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
It's fine.

372
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Why am I going to do that?

373
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
Okay.

374
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
I'm going to break it down.

375
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
She didn't ask me.

376
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
Yes.

377
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
It's a little bit bumpy.

378
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
It's a bit bumpy.

379
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
But everything in.

380
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Okay.

381
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
It's going to be my backup GPS.

382
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
Okay.

383
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,360
So the backup GPS says fly zero nine.

384
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
One.

385
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Three.

386
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Three degrees.

387
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Two.

388
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
And I'm about to pass over.

389
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
I'm going to go.

390
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
I'm going to go.

391
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,360
Okay.

392
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,360
You need to go to school.

393
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
Okay.

394
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
I'm going to take a big hill.

395
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
Come right out.

396
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Of course, I'm going to take a hill.

397
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
I'm going to take a hill.

398
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
So I'm going to climb up a little bit to 2000 feet.

399
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
Oh, man.

400
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,360
That's a long pit of cocktail.

401
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Ladies and gentlemen.

402
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,360
Okay.

403
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Let's see.

404
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,360
You're already sold.

405
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
We're going to do it.

406
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
Yeah.

407
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
We're going to do it.

408
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
We're going to do it.

409
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
We're going to do it.

410
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,760
And we are trying to take the arm to try to do it.

411
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,760
You don't have to do anything to get rid of it by now.

412
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,760
So the next frequency will need will be one, two, nine decibels.

413
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Or, which will be for a big inhale.

414
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,160
I don't know if I'm right here, I don't know if I'm right.

415
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
And by the way, take off time.

416
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,360
Well, that might be because we'll record that one right here.

417
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

418
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,960
It's just a big one.

419
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Nice, nice, nice.

420
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
I don't know.

421
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,560
Yeah, that's pretty neat.

422
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,960
I don't know if I'm right here, but I should, I don't know if I'm right here.

423
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,960
I don't know if I'm right here, I don't know if I'm right here.

424
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
Don't see where those are.

425
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
It's pretty nice.

426
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Any more of my columns.

427
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
I've been talking to them, because I'm very good.

428
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Take it out.

429
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,960
You can continue to take whatever happens.

430
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
But here, it's okay.

431
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
We have right on track.

432
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,960
And we want to see if we're now in 100,900 feet.

433
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,960
A little bounce here.

434
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Then it was.

435
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,960
We have five minutes to run and we can get a view on the street.

436
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
We can get a view on the street.

437
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
We can get a view on the global market right now.

438
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,960
And we're just about over at some race course.

439
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,960
Been a little more.

440
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Keeping up the problems.

441
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
We can get us a little more.

442
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
We're going to make the air scummage.

443
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,960
We're going to give you 2,000 feet right over at some race course.

444
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,960
And we're about to, I think,

445
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Barbara will probably pass me off to the big and hill.

446
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,960
And I'm sure I get to the overhead.

447
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,960
Big and hill.

448
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,960
It's going to be climb up to the maximum altitude.

449
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,960
It'll allow you 2,300 feet.

450
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,960
2,500 feet.

451
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
2,500 feet.

452
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
We don't think it's 1,200.

453
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
It's 1,200.

454
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
It's 1,200.

455
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
It's 1,200.

456
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
It's 1,200.

457
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
It's 1,200.

458
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Thank you.

459
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
1,200.

460
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Perfect timing.

461
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,960
That's right up whenooo town.

462
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
Lets show you!

463
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,060
Good appgoos at Chilean Holdings.

464
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,260

465
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,560
Oh, back to Good appgoos.

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,460
Thank you of the amount of power.

00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
No事 Treasures.

470
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,960
I've got a channel about a total of some of my patients who can see how do you point out how to watch all the way through?

471
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Yeah, but that's a lot of information to the south now.

472
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,400
What is that place?

473
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,360
It's already gorgeous.

474
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,000
And of course, it's very, very beautiful.

475
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It actually's like a lot of insuppeon.

476
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
A microphone here?

477
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,920
7,277,177 Delta-Cher 그러� desert.

He's bends too.

481
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Like other people.

482
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,580
The need to pass through the 8th stretch of the pulse of the ICU.

483
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,680
It's a bit like a-'l两sag'

484
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
3 o'clock somehow.

485
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680

486
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,800
A toe-mate 7 Delta-Cherrary myst with transit to the southeast.

487
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
It's not a loss on that point either.

488
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,820
All right.

489
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,320
Ooh, so I got summer- flight there, they won't let me transit.

00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,680
It's like that, I don't know if I'm going to say it once or twice.

00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,680
I just about self-adventing number 7 don't share.

501
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,680
I'm just about self-adventing number 7 don't share.

502
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
I'm just about self-adventing number 7 don't share.

503
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,680
I'm just about self-adventing number 7 don't share.

504
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,680
I'm just about self-adventing number 7 don't share.

505
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
I'm just about self-adventing number 7 don't share.

506
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,680
By phone number 7 actually, I'm Enterpointed components ofckets-pacha.

507
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:02,680
I'm representing Charly 128 and is his BMR prop numerums.

508
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:08,680

We need to be making hundreds of seats over there.

512
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,680
We can continue our work to maintain our seats.

513
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,680
We need to have a seat about that.

514
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,680
You're a problem, isn't it?

515
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
Yeah.

00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,680
I've got to be in the lookout for a helicopter.

517
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
What is the word?

00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
Seven of us.

519

We can continue our work.

520
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
We need to have a good look out.

521
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
We need to have a good look out.

00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
We need to have a good look out.

We need to have a good look out.

528
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
We need to have a good look out.

529
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,680
We need to have a good look out.

530
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
We need to have a good look.

531
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,680
Have a good look.

532
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,680
We need to have a good look.

533
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:57,720
We need to have a good look out that we are going to have great size about

534
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,720
bigger than theugene.

535
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,720
We need to have a good look out that we are going to have a great size about

536
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:14,720
this is my 17th year train train train on Twitter.

537
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:31,720
So now I headed towards the E-reporting point, known as Deadling, or actually a real war, which is a meekin'

538
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,720
A flying GoPro will, very well known in 10 right now.

539
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Okay, here, I can continue to join with the Amida Fathom laser control.

540
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,720
I guess a prominent was there letting you deal with traffic pass seven o'clock, so it was QSY.

541
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
If you're up, just want to do this one too much?

542
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Okay, I'm going to show you how, I'm quite old, just want to do it.

543
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,720
I'm going to show you how, I'm not wrong.

544
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
All right.

545
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Hey, I helped her. She liked that.

546
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Okay.

547
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,720
I'm not just in the number 277 Delta Sheriff, flight information service.

548
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:20,720
Um, I haven't just done the number 277 Delta Sheriff, flight information service.

549
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Excuse me, 7 T Soundoss here, in local health centre.

550
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Can you help me with two stroke or two pump?

551
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,720
QnH10002BN1-455- zarbarceMirrorceMirrorceMirrorceMirrorceMirrorceMirrorceMirrorceMirrorceMirrorceMirrorceMirrorceMirrorceMirrorceMirrorceMirror.

552
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,720
only 2,200 feet on Q and H1021.

553
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Just like to stay with you on frequency,

554
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,720
there will be a passing to the south of your field.

555
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Roger that's copied.

556
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Finally, we've got six aircraft to the left player.

557
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Meet my search.

558
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
I'm trying to take you to the right.

559
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
I don't think they're all switching to the left player.

560
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
It's just to the south.

561
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
The work is done.

562
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Now, thank you.

563
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
We've got 177-7-0 this year.

564
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
I'm getting more anxious.

565
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
Could you help me then?

566
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
I'll put the traffic on.

567
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
I'll put the traffic on.

568
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Roger that's a little bit too.

569
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
I need to do it too.

570
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,720
OK, so you're now almost a dead lane.

571
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
Be there.

572
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Six miles, two minutes.

573
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
It's beautiful today.

574
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
I can see the city from here on the left side.

575
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
I'll be London City of course.

576
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
Number 277-0 this year.

577
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
I'll stop to meet your field.

578
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
And then, to the sea.

579
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
Roger that's your goal.

580
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
I'll leave you next.

581
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,720
So, the next one, please.

582
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Would be...

583
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Answer.

584
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,720
And that's...

585
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
And...

586
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
1, 2, 6, 3, 4.

587
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Think that's about right.

588
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
And then...

589
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
1, 2, 6, 3, 4.

590
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,720
Think that's about right.

591
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
And then...

592
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
1, 2, 6, 3, 5.

593
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,720
OK, we're almost right on track.

594
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Beautiful.

595
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,720
I'll watch out for number 277-0 this year.

596
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Change frequency to men's send 1, 2, 6, decimal, 3, 5.

597
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
And then...

598
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,720
277-0 this year to men's send today.

599
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Thank you very much.

600
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,720
I'm asking a photo to number 277-0 this year.

Partly, 2,300 feet Q&A, 1,0, 2, 1.

608
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,720
Just passed that link around.

First of all, it's my chance.

614
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
I don't want to do it too.

615
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
I want to do it too.

616
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,720
I actually would like to root just to the north of the year.

617
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,720

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,720

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720

Number 277-0 this year.

637
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
Number 277-0 this year.

638
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,720
I won't normally climb a little bit higher.

639
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,720
Number 277-0 this year.

640
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,720
Number 277-0 this year.

641
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:15,880
at the cloud I think is going to come down a little bit here and we'll see yeah I can already

642
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:25,160
see the cloud is actually I was without clouds for the whole trip and now but I was

643
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,800
rolling and I'd say those clouds are about a 3,000 feet which was what we expected

644
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:40,680
okay now it's just a relax a little bit we'll look out for the sessna

645
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:56,280
and now let's take a look at the white plan though I'd be reaching the boundary in 46 minutes

646
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:03,480
though that would be pre-zero which means 30 minutes after the hour so I'm a little bit late today

647
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,920
gonna be a little longer than I expected because let's see what is our nearest meet is 150

648
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,520
uh a little bit ahead wind but not too much

649
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,760
it's about to coached out and now it's the time to check everything

650
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:27,480
though view all submission temperatures pressure all good speed good

651
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:37,080
I'm going to put I'm going to jump from it to the one to just go away one two

652
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,720
one two four decimal six I think is one that information

653
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,480
got one two four decimal six or keep that on the box

654
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,160
I'm sure though I'll be handed off to them eventually

655
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,920
very nice and stable air here and I'm about to coast out

656
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,320
I can see ships plenty of them and it's easily looks like it's about

657
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,680
3,000 feet so I think I'll stay in 2,200 nice altitude

658
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,760
senseo, I'm sorry, turn it over to the end

659
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,280
check out the intubies on wine.potcho.com and while you're at it check out the suck less so

660
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,880
suck less not pot show.com help us so good

661
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,440
and over seven Delta share coasting out just north of the people now

662
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,040
I'm going to show you a little bit more of something next

663
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:46,360
my goodness it is fucking beautiful today I mean the applying into

664
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:53,160
cloudy or weather which of course is I guess quite logical but that starts the minute

665
00:37:53,160 --> 00:38:01,560
you need to coastline but we are very very very stable air right now which is saying

666
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,880
us it's kind of nice after

667
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,520
perhaps we've been in crap weather for the past couple of flights

668
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,120
there's one to make sure this um oh right now um if you look at the map

669
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,040
now you'll see that there's a wind farm and that's right off to the left of me right now

670
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,160
which is also kind of a handy visual visual reverence

671
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,720
yeah it's uh probably we overcast

672
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,440
I haven't seen it because we got closer to a rudder dam

673
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,080
in a lot when we just sent me a pedal trip here

674
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:05,880
um can do me wow this is flying man

675
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,600
it must get my windscreen now lots of buggy's in crap on it

676
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,040
okay let's just check our piece of please and every minute I'm screaming up a little bit

677
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:27,400
an altitude and keep on the heading which is essentially the border

678
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:35,160
I will be reaching that uh there's a set of uh okay

679
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,560
number seven out of the chair contact with one of my two traffic

680
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,800
two good cheering

681
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,240
he was much smaller than uh than I am he was more like a thousand feet

682
00:39:51,400 --> 00:40:00,040
okay so off to the right now I see Manson Manson is uh also known as a crash pad

683
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,520
this is where uh the boys come back and they're bombing raids

684
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,600
if they couldn't make it back to the home base field they couldn't this thing is so huge

685
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,880
you can take you can put it up with a phone for an airliner

686
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,120
they can feel that sucker up but the boys slide in and the wheels are shit like that

687
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,320
uh hold on let me just tell him I'm here

688
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,720
hope I set the note to share and don't let me in your field

689
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,520
you know so I'm going to share and put it in for your opportunity

690
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,840
that by our next uh estimate zero of three

691
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,160
wow easy with him today

692
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,520
yeah we have about ten minutes to run to the uh at my art boundary

693
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,800
at uh which point they will probably end me off to either runner-down

694
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,800
or Amsterdam info runner-down what good um

695
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,520
don't see what they pass me off to

696
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,000
shoot not for a second

697
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,120
I want to say zoom out that means I'm shooting out on the uh

698
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,600
on the knee pad

699
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:08,440
I'm really loving this thing let me just see what airspace I get into once I pass the FIR boundary

700
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,320
is uh okay but the airspace I will get into

701
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:23,000
um let's see what we can then this is to the radio

702
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,160
eight two this is not an official radio of course

703
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,680
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby

704
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
I'm ready up

705
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,520
it's about all I got

706
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,400
I wish I actually listened on the uh he needs his

707
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,040
essentially the weather okay so once we reach the empire boundary

708
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,200
I'll be handed off by presumptu to Amsterdam info or perhaps

709
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,320
director runner-down without it to Amsterdam is probably what they'll send me to

710
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:13,400
reverse in the room and uh then we route to uh homesteader

711
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,400
the hotel Sierra Delta

712
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,160
beacon and from there hopefully uh hotel

713
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,320
arrivals of the hotel I think Sierra Tango

714
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,760
and then landing on my quite sure what's uh

715
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,320
they're my career runner-down yet

716
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,720
um uh I'm too sure what the runway is going to be but

717
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,440
I don't know that once I get a little bit closer I can listen in on the

718
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,760
which is one one eight that's one two

719
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:49,800
that will put that and we'll listen on back in box

720
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,960
up again and number two seven seven Delta Sierra has one minute to run to the

721
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,560
empire boundary

722
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,600
demolition of the hotel we've been doing touch on

723
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,920
the hotel station uh that's your space

724
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,600
demolition of the hotel

725
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,160
the translation of all the outs to that one one nine

726
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,640
this one one seven five

727
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,760
one one nine just one one seven five

728
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,920
thank you very much for the two seven seven Delta Sierra

729
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,720
okay I don't know about this one this is one one nine

730
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,480
one seven

731
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:33,560
two seven seven Delta Sierra

732
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,320
white information service

733
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,560
absolutely information number two seven seven Delta

734
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,560
share of flight information service

735
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,360
I know joy you as well I want to more

736
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,160
that's most uh uh one two more that's one three

737
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,840
and so that information number two seven seven Delta

738
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,200
share of flight information service

739
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:17,160
all right good morning and number two seven seven

740
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,200
Delta share of the empire of echo gold take over for

741
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,080
two what are them just past the uh and my

742
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,520
are boundary routing to the hotel share of Delta

743
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,440
uh picking it with uh like my information service

744
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,360
completely occurred late two thousand two hundred feet

745
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,960
and one two one seven one eight two number two seven seven

746
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:56,440
okay so that would take it the long way across the water

747
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,120
and so far everything looking through the

748
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,080
they were one four one five is the the hour we're looking for

749
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:13,560
and it's got a lot of perfect should be there in uh twenty eight minutes

750
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,920
which will have an hour

751
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,680
we're doing okay here for a bit of a time

752
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:33,480
you know the way the uh the way the clouds are right now

753
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:40,120
uh and you're over the water if you look out straight in front of you

754
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,320
the tendency is to think that you're bleeding or

755
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,280
now that you're going the wrong direction or that you're turning or banking

756
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,680
and that's really where the instruments come in pretty handy because you know you're not

757
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,960
or sometimes you think you're flying straight level and you look at the instruments

758
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,800
and you're not you're banking and that's just purely an optical illusion you know it's

759
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,320
like uh at the perception everything gets really weird when you go

760
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,920
white it out time I look down to the deck

761
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,280
that world of course uh all that wacky perception goes away and

762
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:23,480
a few quite good because I can see a ship so I can see a ways

763
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,560
that's nice when you have a clear shot down to the bottom of the course with this highway

764
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,320
I have a fantastic view

765
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,600
I haven't feeling really going to have to start to send me a little bit

766
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,160
what's a good closer to uh

767
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:49,320
hotels here at Delta which is another 25 minutes to run okay let's listen to some

768
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,520
crappy ass Dutch radio then I don't actually have a radio

769
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,720
wrong I'm sorry I haven't tons of radios on board but I don't have an heaven

770
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,640
I don't have an heaven uh don't hide my receiver anything what I do have

771
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,320
is the ADF uh directional minor which works basically on medium way

772
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,320
and uh it's like a dial up or something

773
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:28,200
I don't know why so I can basically dial up any frequency I want in the end then like this

774
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,400
about the radio repair attention what's going on

775
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,640
I'm going to have you guys want for the ride to talk to

776
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,120
it's pretty boring but feeling looks like it's

777
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,640
I'm like down a little bit here

778
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,600
I'll be about uh

779
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,640
less than 3,000 now probably about 2,700

780
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,080
I think it's going to get even lower

781
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:11,720
okay I can see the uh yeah I can see the new cloud layer

782
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:22,040
10,57 Delta share with 24 miles to run to um state of uh descending to

783
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,080
new altitude 1,202 underneath her main DMC

784
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:38,120
okay I think my guess of 1,200 feet is going to be just about right

785
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,320
and this shit's coming up pretty fast now

786
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:50,360
I'm under the 65 airspeed and about 165 rounds of speed

787
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:59,000
and I think the timing of the decision was just perfect but I'm going to have to go down

788
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:06,920
below 1,200 feet because the shit is a little bit lower than expected

789
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,880
I'm now 1,100

790
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,240
1,000 feet I'm going to be a little bit closer to the deck than expected

791
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,200
and here is the crap just showing up at 900

792
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,680
oh shit let's get a little lower

793
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,080
800

794
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,560
best

795
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,200
and we're going for 6,00

796
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:49,880
holding your hand

797
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:57,080
and remember 7 Delta share reporting you altitude 5,00 feet to her main DMC

798
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:05,400
well it looks like it almost touched the water from here

799
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,000
I have to dodge around a couple of ships at this altitude

800
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,000
and we're doing one on track five minutes to run to

801
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,040
hotel share in Delta which means we'll be

802
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:27,160
inland okay so we're going to be the coast here

803
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,640
okay there's two lighthouses

804
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,680
needs to be aware of and there's also a

805
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,560
lighter field around here man it's kind of crumbly

806
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,720
okay let's get down let's get down let's get down let's get down let's get down

807
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:54,280
totally the MC back to the MC okay we're good here

808
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:03,080
okay we're 7,00 feet just onto the clouds look at pretty good okay now are in

809
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:08,680
it off puts hotel which is bearing zero three three

810
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,360
make sure we stay visible with the ground

811
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,520
and of course 7 Delta share is passed

812
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,560
a little share Delta tracking in World Hotel Arrival

813
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,280
brought her down because QS1118 doesn't look to zero

814
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,400
thank you 9% of Delta share

815
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,840
a little bit up number 277 Delta CRI found

816
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:47,560
a number 277 Delta share a system of 1-8-2

817
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:52,040
and the environment from there looks just past hotel share of Delta

818
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:57,240
expecting a hotel arrival have a Oscar number 277 Delta share

819
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,560
a number 277 Delta share of Delta share of Delta share of Delta share of Delta share of Delta

820
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,440
that was readability to read your email please

821
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,920
that's not a zero number 277 Delta

822
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,440
I'm sorry readability wanted to

823
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,200
remember Delta share of Delta share of Delta share of Delta share of Delta share of Delta share

824
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,920
yes correct you should have a strip on the

825
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,360
and after arrival I will be taxi to the Alpha Front once

826
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:34,360
Okay, all there was one file.

827
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:49,360

830
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,360
But I hear here, and some basically in the hole right now.

831
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,360
I hear that even though the hole under the cloud.

832
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,360
So back to the front end of the track.

833
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,360
Let me go to my last reporting point.

834
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,360
And, uh...

835
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,360
The oven site. There we go.

836
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,360
I know with the road.

837
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,360
The number 7 Delta share a tank of field of sight.

838
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,360
I don't know the showdown or change, but I can track it for the hallway two more.

839
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,360
Joining down with more to one.

840
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,360
I don't think that you know that.

841
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,360
I don't think that you know that.

842
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,360
But, let's see.

843
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,360
I can't take over two more.

844
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,360
Let's see.

845
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,360
We can.

846
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,360
We can.

847
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,360
Slow down.

848
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,360
Slow down nicely.

849
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,360
Hey.

850
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,360
Let's throw a key on your base.

851
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,360
How many paints on the four seven Delta share?

852
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,360
Seven Delta share?

853
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,360
Seven Delta share?

854
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,360
Third base.

855
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,360
Turning base.

856
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,360
Number two.

857
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,360
Number two.

858
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,360
Okay.

859
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,360
Bring it in the flaps.

860
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,360
Three greens.

861
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,360
And.

862
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,360
Now with all my body.

863
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,360
Not sure.

864
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,360
Can happen.

865
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,360
Not sure?

866
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,360
Remember.

867
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,360
Okay.

868
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,360
We take the 50% wildida.

869
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,360
On the patch, let's look for it.

870
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,360
Wait.

871
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,360
We take it in zero shit, but I'm not sure.

872
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,360
There's a cleareth decor for a mid to four.

873
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,360
I'd have to click the 0 polarization sign.

874
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,360
Not sure.

875
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,360
Dead Attack.

876
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,360
DeOKA.

877
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,360
Still remind me what you saw on the floor.

878
00:55:39,360 --> 00:56:09,360
I'm not sure, but I'm not sure if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I

879
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:39,360
don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but then I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't think I'm fine or not, but I went to buy my food, right now but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I'm fine, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine and I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not, but I don't know if I'm fine or not,

880
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:58,360
over the

881
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,260
temperature on the

882
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:03,500
of the

883
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,500
So I forgot to talk to you.

884
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,500
Ha ha.

885
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,500
Made it down.

886
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,500
Holy moly.

887
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,500
That was kind of interesting.

888
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
That was a nice little bit of crosswind there.

889
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,500
And then I bounced her up.

890
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:18,500
Of course, my standard type of landing.

891
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,500
And then set her down nicely.

892
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,500
So I kind of worked out.

893
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,500
And following the martial art now.

894
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,500
That's kind of cool.

895
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,500
Follow me.

896
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Follow me.

897
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,500
Follow me.

898
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,500
That's okay.

899
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,500
That's so handy when you have these martial art hooddids.

900
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,500
It's my problem with that wind.

901
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,500
It's my problem with the wind.

902
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,500
If it's a go, it's my problem.

903
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,500
So what kind of happened there?

904
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:49,500
The reason why I stopped talking to you is.

905
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,500
I'm with you dude.

906
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,500
It's because.

907
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,500
To give me instructions to turn base lag.

908
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,500
And I was at about 900 feet.

909
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,500
I'd want to do extend a little bit.

910
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,500
I'd want to do extend a bit.

911
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,500
So I had to basically come drop and out of the sky.

912
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,500
But he want me to go dude.

913
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Okay, shutting down motherfucker.

914
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,500
Hello.

915
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,500
Sorry.

916
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,500
No, for yours buyers.

917
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,500
Yeah.

918
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,500
And you're going to go and take it.

919
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,500
I'm going to go to Germany today.

920
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,500
Okay.

921
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,500
But it's hard to do that.

922
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,500
I'm going to do everything I can to do.

923
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,500
Okay, thank you very much.

924
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,500
Another part.

925
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,500
No podcast.

926
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,500
Stick it in your ear.
