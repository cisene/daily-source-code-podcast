00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's really needs you.

196
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The show where we help with demos.

197
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The show is very fun.

198
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Not always.

199
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,040
It's just Rr.

200
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,000
It's just Rr, Ebzy.

201
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's even fun.

202
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's probably the only thing we're controlling

203
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Day for a movie.

204
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's much easier for us to learn.

205
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Go get a baby.

206
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's go.

207
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's הת up the movie Yeah.

208
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Or it facks.

209
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I waste my mouth, check.

210
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I can't go.

211
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's always been HHS.

212
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Not a woman.

213
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Tonight we go.

214
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's an transgender festival,

215
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I got the whole house sleeping in, I'm up here bangin' away, Adam's at it, he's in full effect.

216
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He's numbers off the bathroom wall, he'd be liin' at least so you give him a call.

217
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He never thought that this could happen to you.

218
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Please forgive me for the themes I do.

219
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Do a donuts and a neighbor's yard.

220
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Lexin' at your mama's credit card.

221
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Lookin' for love and all the wrong places.

222
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't know the names, but you know that basis.

223
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What goes up would've come back down?

224
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So you better get out of town.

225
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What was I thinking?

226
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What was I thinking?

227
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
When I got to try and get shaped my head.

228
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The rough ones might best breathe better go.

229
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Kids haven't on the way to school.

230
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Walking in, thinking man, I'm old.

231
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I teach you get me as because he was up for it.

232
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He said, I read your little bird you got to bring me sick.

233
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, in the morning you will realize.

234
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And on the 9th you won 1st prize.

235
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Late drinking games, naked twister.

236
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You knew that she was suddenly but you couldn't resist me.

237
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Now what goes up must come back down.

238
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So you better get outta town!

239
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What was I thinking?

240
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What was I thinking?

241
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
When I got to try and get shaped my head.

242
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The rough ones might best breathe better go.

243
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What was I thinking?

244
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What was I thinking?

245
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
When I got to try and get shaped my head.

246
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The rough ones might best breathe better go.

247
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was half naked in my hands, and I woke up in the back of my neighbor's bigotron.

248
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What was I thinking? What was I thinking when I got to try and help out my head?

249
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:11,700
What, what's my thinking. What was I thinking when I got to try and get to love my best friends better, what was I thinking

250
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:27,940
What was I thinking? You'll find it in the show notes at dailysourceco.com and I was actually thinking about

251
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,940
rolling out the hit test but yeah I just want to keep this vibe going for a second.

252
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:04,940
This is my era with a bit to see how you're hearing your voice, but I don't want to cry.

253
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:11,940
How they're up, I need to shut up, I don't want to see that.

254
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,940
And I didn't hear that.

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,780
Law of finger Marcus, dude

541
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,640
I agree 100%.

542
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,920
That's the reason why we're hunting this man.

543
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,600
That is that rock.

544
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,100
The Money, power, the glory to glory,

545
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,460
test the hunger of the 그렇지...

546
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,940
Pegut make him lick of Poland into their homepage,

547
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,240
I don't know, it's a daily source code.com.

548
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,440
At a pretty interesting morning today, I was in London at noon.

549
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,040
Actually, I was a little bit early.

550
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,640
I got to the train station here at the 10th, 15th,

551
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,140
and the 10th, 17th, train, hadn't arrived yet.

552
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,940
So I was at Waterloo Station a little bit earlier,

553
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,940
but it was a beautiful day.

554
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,940
It was so, so incredibly nice today.

555
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,740
And I had a meeting with a super agent Keith.

556
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,940
I should introduce you guys to super agent Keith.

557
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,540
I think he'd be pretty funny on the air.

558
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,040
It's what he is.

559
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,240
He's a super agent Keith man.

560
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:50,040
He knows everybody in media, him and his partner, Alan.

561
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,540
But usually I hit the road with the super agent Keith.

562
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,540
He got us to hook up and news of the world for Dr. Cockney

563
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,540
and a whole bunch of other things that he's working on.

564
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,540
It guys amazing.

565
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,540
And I had this idea.

566
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,540
You know, there's a chain of...

567
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,540
I might as well just say it.

568
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,540
There's an English version of Starbucks.

569
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
It's called Cafe Neuro.

570
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,540
Only Cafe Neuro actually has, you know, like some style

571
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
and some class to it.

572
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,540
And I kind of like the way things are set up better.

573
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,540
When, you know, you, if you want a, like a frape latte,

574
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,540
they have like a premix thing on the shelf.

575
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,540
You grab that day then throw the icing.

576
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,540
It's premix, right?

577
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,540
They throw the icing and then they do the whole blending thing.

578
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,540
But, you know, the kind of nice, nice leather chairs and stuff.

579
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,540
And I like it.

580
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,540
So they have 360 stores throughout the UK

581
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,540
and they're branching out.

582
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,540
I think to Russia, to Portugal, to Turkey.

583
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,540
And, you know, I always have been looking for a great

584
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,540
extension of the Pod Save Music platform

585
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,540
by, you know, having a retail outlet.

586
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,540
You know, and this is not a, this is more like a, you know,

587
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,540
how can we work together?

588
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,540
This is not a business deal.

589
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,540
So, anyway, I was supposed to meet with the owner,

590
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,540
who's apparently a very colorful guy.

591
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,540
And, and the managing director, who's in, in, in, in,

592
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,540
Britain, it means that's the guy runs a show.

593
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,540
And so, unfortunately, the owner couldn't meet because his father

594
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,540
had just passed away.

595
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,540
And so, he had to go to America and deal with affairs,

596
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,540
which, of course, sucked.

597
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,540
But the managing director is gay at this gay.

598
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Fuck.

599
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,540
Where did that come from?

600
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,540
This guy, Peter Edinger.

601
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,540
That's Peter.

602
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,540
I hope you're not listening.

603
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,540
You know, so I kind of pitch it to him.

604
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,540
I said, you know, what are you paying PRS?

605
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,540
He said, oh, man, how's it?

606
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,540
Please stop.

607
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,540
I owe those guys so much money.

608
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,540
It's like 50,000 pounds a month or something like that.

609
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,540
It's ridiculous across 360 outlets.

610
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,540
Said, you know, dude, why don't we go completely pod safe?

611
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,540
And so, I explained him, I explained him all about the network

612
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,540
and God reminds me, I still have to send him an email

613
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
and a couple of links.

614
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,540
I want to send him a link to a pod sent music rewind.

615
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
What else?

616
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,540
The Angie Bee's chill cast, which is, they really play kind of like a mix of jazz.

617
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,540
And, you know, some, they will play some rock.

618
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,540
But the guy is really actually, he's very involved in it.

619
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,540
And they have a whole distribution system.

620
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:26,540
You know, basically some playlists, gadget that's in every one of these

621
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,540
stores or shops, whatever you want to call it.

622
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,540
And they get an update CD once a month.

623
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,540
And, you know, like, dude, you know, let's just make a stand and don't pay for that anymore

624
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,540
and use the music from the Ponce Music Network.

625
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,540
And, you know, we could do all kinds of cool stuff.

626
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,540
And, hey, give us a couple of skews, you know, and then we can sell CDs.

627
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,540
Screw Starbucks.

628
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,540
So, you know, this is based on a personal relationship

629
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,540
of super agent Keith Hans with these guys.

630
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,540
And, he said, you know, it's amazing.

631
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,540
We sat there for like 40 minutes, 45 minutes.

632
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,540
We actually went to a cafe near around the corner.

633
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,540
I'm telling you, in Britain, people have a meeting with you to go out.

634
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,540
It's great.

635
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
It's a beautiful day.

636
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
Let's go drink.

637
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,540
And what we had to, you know, the frappelate.

638
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,540
And he said, usually this guy would only last like 10 minutes.

639
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,540
So, it's very possible something might happen.

640
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,540
You know, he said he was going to check out the network.

641
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,540
He was not familiar with it.

642
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,540
And I'm sending a couple of links to a couple of shows.

643
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,540
Can you imagine how incredibly cool that would be?

644
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,540
Ah.

645
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Oh, man.

646
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,540
Anyway, we'll see what happens.

647
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,540
And I got to get super agent Keith on the show.

648
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,540
You guys will love him.

649
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,540
But he's got some awesome stories he'll share with us.

650
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,540
So, I look for talk talk on Napster.

651
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
You know, what a jib this thing is.

652
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,540
So, you know, you pay this, I don't know, like 15 bucks a month.

653
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,540
So, you can, you know, play everything basically, stream it.

654
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,540
Stream it over the net.

655
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,540
And on talk talk, they only give you like a 30 second sample.

656
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,540
And you can, you can buy the individual track.

657
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,540
You have to buy the entire album.

658
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
I just blows.

659
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,540
Here, here's a better track.

660
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,540
This one you'll like.

661
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,540
I'm sure.

662
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,540
It's a little bit of reggae for you.

663
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,540
Check it out.

664
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:24,540
You're alone.

665
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,540
I like to make a motion.

666
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,540
To rock this mother house.

667
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,540
You're alone.

668
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,540
Please not man, y'all they'll go.

669
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,540
And try this reggae house.

670
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,540
And maybe you'll see clearly.

671
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,540
Who's the hardest working lawyer.

672
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,540
We still do time.

673
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,540
You're alone.

674
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,540
You're alone.

675
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,540
You're alone.

676
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,540
What do you say?

677
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,540
He might remember when I think.

678
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,540
You're alone.

679
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,540
You're alone.

680
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,540
You're alone.

681
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,540
You're alone.

682
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,540
You're alone.

683
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,540
You're alone.

684
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:20,540
You're alone.

685
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,540
Yo, how's it going?

686
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,540
Out-of-a-attention.

687
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,540
The official musical.

688
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,540
It's just a cha cha.

689
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,540
So special jersey?

690
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,540
Yo, to my named Man P.J. Boatley 73 out of Portugal.

691
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,540
For making a brand smack.

692
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,540
A new summertime version of the jersey time theme song.

693
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,540
I mean, how awesome is that?

694
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,040
So I've got somebody really kind of interested to bring on to the�

695
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
to the positive music network this week.

696
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,880
Well, first of all, I got to give some love to all the lawyers out there.

697
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,080
How are you doing?

698
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,480
Because Steven P. Richards is a lawyer.

699
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,080
And he's on the positive music network.

700
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,800
I know. It's crazy. A lawyer who wants to get involved with podcasting.

701
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
I know. It's crazy. Who would have fun?

702
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,200
Anyway, Steven P. Richards, he's a bankruptcy lawyer at a woman's in North Carolina.

703
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,760
And you know those bankruptcy lawyers really rock.

704
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,960
But you know, even when we want to talk about some more credibility,

705
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,480
Mr. Richards is a veteran. He was in the Panamanian invasion.

706
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,000
He was in Desert Storm. And he sent me an email about the song that he posted

707
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,400
to the Pan safe music network about how the soldiers and I rack are currently enduring

708
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,240
a tremendous amount of hardships. And he came up and made a song about it.

709
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:29,320
And that song was like so much that Dave Marsh played it up on serious on his series show.

710
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,520
Neil Young is put it on his website, Living with War.

711
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,920
And I think it's completely appropriate for the Daily Source Code on a football Friday.

712
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,120
Check it out. This is Steven P. Richards with This is War.

713
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:58,200
Playing our soldiers' song.

714
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,040
Playing our soldiers' song. Soldiers walking through the night,

715
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,160
distance shots, they hear the fight. Some are boys, some are men,

716
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,560
some are never come back again.

717
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,840
Frel is flying over here, laying down while in bed.

718
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,200
Canons tearing up the ground, slicing through the battle sands.

719
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:31,080
Do you recognize? This is war. This is war.

720
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,080
And he's alive. He's alive.

721
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,080
He's a familiar comprehend.

722
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:45,160
We're the ones, spare the war. I can make it and I can take it in.

723
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,280
The radio cracks and cries. I cough a fire, lies the sky.

724
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,480
The septic smell is stealing death. And it's trade. The sergeants breathe.

725
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
The medic cries and screams out.

726
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,160
Loudly found spiss into the ground. Another tag beneath the tongue.

727
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,320
Another war that's never won.

728
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,640
Do you recognize? This is war.

729
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,280
This is war. And these lives are long.

730
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:28,760
We're the ones, spare the war. I can make it and I can take it in.

731
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:42,760
Bring our soldiers' song, bring, bring, bring.

732
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:49,560
Bring our soldiers' song, bring, bring.

733
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,760
This is a caro knock-up on the door. A baby spoon hits the floor.

734
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,120
A metal chest to ease the pain. From burning words to can't explain.

735
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,160
It's the way the world goes black. She never thought he wouldn't come back.

736
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:12,280
Another child that's never known. Another angel coming home.

737
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:22,840
Do you recognize? This is war. This is war. And these lives are long.

738
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:33,240
Do you comprehend? We're the ones, spare the war. I can make it and I can take it in.

739
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:47,240
Bring our soldiers' song, bring, bring.

740
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:57,720
Bring our soldiers' song, bring, bring.

741
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:06,200
Bring our soldiers' song, bring, bring.

742
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,200
Thank you. Sir Jersey Tag, the show musicologist of the Charlie.

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,160
Stephen P. Richards, bring our soldiers home. Yeah, this is war.

744
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Now, the hardships. I know firsthand have been there. I went to Iraq.

745
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,480
And deserts, hoax ass.

746
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,360

750
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,680
Gives us a whistle.

751
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,720
Hi, Adam, it's Matt from Gamesweasel. Hope you're very well, sir. Coming up on this week's show,

752
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,560
we've got reviews of Big Brain Academy and Mario Party 8 for the Wii.

753
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,240
We're looking at Mies as well that you can create on the Wii some celebrity ones.

754
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,520
I've got details of Resident Evil 5. We're given away a couple of Final Fantasy 3 for the DS.

And also, we've got a Lego Indiana Jones trailer. Check it out, gamesweasel.btpodshow.com.

756
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:30,040
It started all August 3rd, 2006, with a month pod began.

757
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:36,280
It was more than just for kicks. Independent music is alive on this show.

758
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,520
Freedom from Big Media on every episode.

759
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:47,480
If the IA, if the IU, the Mothman is riding a high.

760
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:56,200
If the IA, if the IU, the Mothman is flying tonight.

761
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,200
On any given day or night, you might see him coming your way.

762
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,360
That shadow we figure from Indiana, what's he gonna say?

763
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,360
He's a college student by day, with a nighttime really shows.

764
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,680
Just whose act is, what he wants, what he really knows.

765
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:27,480
If the IA, if the IU, the Mothman is riding a high.

766
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:36,200
If the IA, if the IU, the Mothman is flying tonight.

767
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,680
Get on!

768
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:07,160

Yeah.

771
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,760
Yeah, he has it.

772
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,240
The Moss Man.

773
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,840
Happy 50th episode.

774
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,580
To the Mothman, Zack the Mothman, Daggy.

775
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,080
The Moth pod celebrated its 50th episode.

776
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,920
That was, of course, a Jeff Smith original.

777
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,520
Ha, just Smith and I love you, man.

778
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,160
He's a hit machine.

779
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,920
Oh, yeah.

780
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
Maybe it's just someone to older Europe

781
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,760
that's making me feel somewhat about how modern you know what I'm saying.

782
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,960
Um, okay, you know what, uh, 35, it's, um, man.

783
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,080
It's like 1 a.m. and I got to go get Patricia tomorrow from, uh, from Hilverson.

784
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,560
So I got to get up on time and, uh, the weather's going to be okay, so I don't have to get up too early

785
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,760
and think of all kinds of alternatives and stuff.

786
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,560
So that'll be all right.

787
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,400
But I got to get to bed.

788
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,960
So, uh, one more song.

789
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,680
Let me see, Jersey Joe, uh, let me see.

790
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Adam, I encouraged, I love, I love the way he puts the encouraged and parentheses.

791
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,720
Yeah, like a true Jersey boy.

792
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,240
I, uh, I encourage them fuckers to come on board a bit off the beaten path of normal play,

793
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,920
but boy, these women are talented.

794
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,840
I saw him live and they blew me away.

795
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,840
Excellent musicians and really sweet people and they totally get the P.M.

796
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
ad.

797
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,040
And of course, that's why I'm playing it from podsafe music network brings you some hot,

798
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:54,920
smoking women with great strings, especially the G strings, although the E strings are

799
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,360
okay, too.

800
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,360
Red Molly.

801
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:03,360
He's darling Corey, on a football Friday.

802
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
Two, three.

803
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Dig a hole, dig a hole in the metal.

804
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Dig a hole in the cool damn brown.

805
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,360
Dig a hole, dig a hole in the metal.

806
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,360
Oh, we're gonna lay down, I'll lay down.

807
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Wake up, wake up, darling Corey.

808
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,360
What makes you sleep so sound?

809
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,360
I rev'n a waffles as I come in, I'm gonna taste your house down.

810
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:46,360
Well, the first time I seen darling Corey, she was sitting by the banks of the sea.

811
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Adam fought it for round her body, and it bounced,

812
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,360
and I've stringed on a knee.

813
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Dig a hole, dig a hole in the metal.

814
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,360
Dig a hole in the cool damn brown.

815
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Dig a hole, dig a hole in the metal.

816
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:05,360
I'm gonna lay down, I'll lay down.

817
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,360
Go away, go away, darling Corey.

818
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,360
Quit hanging it around my bed.

819
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,080
Licker, as roar my body

820
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,360

00:38:46,360 --> 00:39:15,520
I really think it's time to reboot my computer.

829
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,920
Everything I do, like, cuts out the sound, suck ass.

830
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,880
Because I was, of course, thinking, I don't really want to end the football Friday with that song.

831
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,480
You know, I gotta just play one more and just kind of get us into the weekend.

832
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,520
You know what I'm saying? How about some valley line?

833
00:39:45,520 --> 00:40:07,520
We met on the subway, I paid on a million days, so glad we had the screaming jammer.

834
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,800
We're still in the last class, we're gonna take a part of the stars.

All right, that's the way to end the flu bar front end.

843
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:10,640
That is a lot hanging on from the Plotship music network and I've prepared it to

844
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,600
see the sunshine band previously, but I want to change that it's more like a Dan

845
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:23,640
Artman tune back. Dan kind of lives in this track somehow, it's nice.

846
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:31,640
Little Dan with his red lip mask. That's it for Denny Source code episode 645.

847
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:38,640
There are 645. Dial up networking could not complete the connection to the server.

848
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,640
Check your configuration and try the connection again.

849
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,640
645. Never even heard of this error before.

850
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,640
I got a stop using Windows M.A.

851
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,640
Now I'll never get my D.S.A.

852
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,640
645.

853
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,640
All right, show notes, links to all the songs played on today's

Stick it in your ear.

860
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,640
You, Adam, I've been listening to the daily source code now for about two years.

861
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,640
And one thing's been bothering me at the end of the odd podcast.

862
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,640
You'll hear this.

863
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,640
Another podshow podcast. Stick it in your ear.

864
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,640
I ain't sticking nothing up my ear.

865
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,640
I'll keep listening.

866
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
But I ain't sticking nothing up my ear.

867
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,640
I know your sexual preferences kind of sway.

868
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,640
But mind's the one way street out.

869
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,640
Thanks. I'll keep listening.

870
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,640
But this is Rokendel one from rockendelone.podshow.com.

871
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,640
The best in the brightest.

872
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,640
Saved up daily by the sharpest minds in content delivering podshow and limelight.
