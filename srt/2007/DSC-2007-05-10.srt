1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There, bro.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Seerator.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode five, nine or eight.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm guessing it's a battle curry.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In their eyes, it's a place that you find you discover.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Like you love it.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You cut this day on this rock, not so rock.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The night and on which you found a lover.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then you switch and you feel that it's in your pesky cup.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Your pesky pesky pesky cup.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Then you smile, he goes wild.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Didn't understand.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That was money to be made.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You see this car, the Muscat played.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
By organising.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Say.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Sense.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But you're not.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
She was set to kick and save me.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're not.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're just suing her smile.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
She was set to kick and save me.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're not.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We're long, we're just shooting, oh, we spot her out

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We're gonna be a very big place, so be yourself, don't fill out some place

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I love your mind, I love him twice, twice if all you would

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You pay the price, don't go too high with it

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And don't be a star, it's such a drag and take care of yourself

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't begin to lie, it's a hard life to live, so live it

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, I should be a friend, I'll never pretend to you

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You know that I love you girl, and I'll send you away

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But you're not, she was such a kick, girl, she made

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're not, you're not, she's a cheater, no, star, it's a real

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She was such a kick, girl, she made

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're not, you're not, she's a cheater, no, star, it's a real

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't begin to lie, it's a hard life to live, so live

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So be yourself, don't go too high with it

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
She was such a kick, girl, she made

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:41,760
The punch you're exclusive, the cooks.

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,760
And Pete Townsend, Urla from the in the attic CD release party that was held in London just a couple

47
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
of weeks ago.

48
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,760
You can find that there's a video for it in the attic.podshow.com.

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,760
It's not on the pod save music network for obvious reasons, but we do have the exclusive

50
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
for the website and you can play the video.

51
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,760
It is the daily source code episode number five, nine or eight coming to you from the curry

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,760
manner in the affluent suburb of Surinone is Gilford on the west side of G-town.

54
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,760
A nice day today, or at least by my terms now.

55
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Now that I had that life-changing experience of flying home in the severe wind share conditions,

56
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
any kind of weather is kind of looking beautiful to me.

57
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
And it sounded kind of breaking through just a bit.

58
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Wouldn't be a bad day for flying.

59
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,760
I got so many responses about that was it about Tuesday evenings episode.

60
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,760
And the next time I fly, I am definitely going to take a longer recording equipment.

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,760
I've done it before, and it does work out quite well, particularly because you really can

62
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
feel the sound of the engine.

63
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,760
I've been able to perfect the mic technique just the right way so you get the perfect balance

64
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,760
of the radio, the intercom, and then the ambient sound.

65
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,760
And it takes a little bit of work, though, because I got it at its stuff down.

66
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,760
And it just takes a little more work than usual, but I will do it.

67
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,760
If not for you, I'm going to do it for myself.

68
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
I'm tired, I got to tell you.

69
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,760
Yesterday, full day in London at the UK crash pad, but I don't know, there's the BT pod show

70
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,760
offices in Swanky's shortage.

71
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,760
Signed up two new shows, which I'm really excited about.

72
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,760
One is a games weasel.

73
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,760
This is going to be great.

74
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,760
This guy named Matt, who's a games expert.

75
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
He's going to do a daily audio show.

76
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
I'm sorry, he's going to do a weekly audio show.

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,760
And I hope moving towards video, but he's got some pretty cool concepts.

78
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,760
He's got great contacts, and he knows all the latest shit about all the latest games

79
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
coming out.

80
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
So that's a show that's coming out.

81
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,760
And then we have UK listeners.

82
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,760
May have heard of Barry from Wattford.

83
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,760
I think he does a kind of a semi-regular calling on LBC.

84
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
Is it the London Broadcasting Corporation?

85
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,760
It's London Radio Station.

86
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,760
I haven't feeling he calls a couple other stations around the UK as well.

87
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
But he's going to be doing a daily show for us.

88
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,760
It's audio again to start with Barry from Wattford.

89
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,760
It's just the most opinionated old fuck you've ever heard.

90
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:12,760
It's kind of like a combination of was a geriatric 1897 or whatever the hell.

91
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,760
And a little bit of Sam Kinnison thrown in there.

92
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,760
It's hard to explain.

93
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,760
So signed some shows.

94
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
We did some meetings.

95
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
It was always good to hang out.

96
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,760
I went to British telecom.

97
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,760
I sat with Gavin Patterson for our quarterly update.

98
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,760
It's fun because things are going well.

99
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,760
So things are very nice.

100
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
What do you do?

101
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,760
I had a late dinner at the Great Eastern lunchroom.

102
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
I think it is or dining room.

103
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
And I wasn't home until like 1130, man.

104
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
It was just a full last day.

105
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,760
And I got another one of those days today coming up.

106
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Of course, don't forget we've got all the San Francisco calls.

107
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,760
I'm looking at it and out starting it around 430 San Francisco awakens.

108
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,760
So it's just a busy day.

109
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
I've been collecting lots of stuff for tomorrows.

110
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Football Friday the maximum music edition of course and no

111
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Sevant for you today.

112
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Although I do have Sevant calling in and providing appropriate feedback.

113
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,760
And of course we did have the Lady Patricia on yesterday, which I don't know about you.

114
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
But I always love having my wife on.

115
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,760
And we kind of got it open up about the lesbian kissing experiences.

116
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,360
I think I need to delve a little bit deeper into that though.

117
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Hey Adam, long time listening to the show here. This is Eric Skiff.

118
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
It worked.

119
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,360
I started a company called Cliff Marks a couple months ago and since starting there I've just been amazed at what I've learned on the site.

120
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,760
So we started a podcast called Cliff of Earth City where we share a bunch of things that we learned every day.

121
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:44,360
But I had one today that just made me think of you and I was listening to you in Lady Patricia yesterday and thought you know what Adam might get a kick out of this.

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,360
So one of the clips we featured yesterday is compared to things.

123
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:54,960
Getting a raise of $50,000 or having sex once a week instead of once a month.

124
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,160
Wait a minute. What are you supposing there my friend?

125
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,560
Now I got to put myself in that situation first and that does not seem like a very happy one.

126
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,760
And then talked about which made people happier.

127
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,360
So which would you assume?

128
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,960
Well, $50,000 extra dollars or...

129
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Let me think about it for a second.

130
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
$50,000 extra dollars.

131
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
And I don't care how rich you are.

132
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
There's always room for extra money.

133
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Or having sex once a week instead of once a month.

134
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Hmm.

135
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Well, I guess with $50,000 you could essentially...

136
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,960
And you didn't say love or having a loving relationship or making love.

137
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,160
You said having sex.

138
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,160
I think the 50 grand will get me a hell of a lot more than once a week.

139
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,360
Well, the answers at clippaversity.com.

140
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,760
But I'm definitely interested to hear what you're thinking is.

141
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,760
That's clipped like a paperclip and a versity like university.

142
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,960
Clippaversity.

143
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,760
What we learn every day from clippmark.com.

144
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,040
Got all right? Well, I'll go and check it out, but you've got my answer there.

145
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,560
By the way, no phone calls at all today. What's going on with you guys?

146
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,960
Come on. Here's the UK number to call.

147
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:16,160
Plus four, four, two, seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three.

148
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
As I said plenty of comments coming in.

149
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,360
This is a rather long one, but it was kind of nice to just as a personal feedback to me.

150
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,760
And you know, so I thought the sound quality really wanted a little bit of extra length.

151
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,960
Let's check this out.

152
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,600
Hi Adam. This is Paul Smith.

153
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,360
Gotta hope you can hear me, okay?

154
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
He calls doing like a sound seeing tour here.

155
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,760
I don't know what his setup is, but it sounded pretty good.

156
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,960
Despite a bit of wind.

157
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,360
In fact, I'm going to back off the mic a little bit.

158
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,320
Back off, brother.

159
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,840
So I just heard DSC 596.

160
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,400
And, uh, man, and I'm glad you're alive, too.

161
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,400
That sounded very cool.

162
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,360
I just wanted to tell you where it was.

163
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,200
I am, uh, this is again, Paul Smith, uh, from Gainesville, Florida.

164
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:09,200
And, um, I'm on, um, on a trip, a business trip down to Marco Island in South West, Florida.

165
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,600
And I'm sitting on the 7th floor of the Marriott.

166
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,640
And, um, this one just went down.

167
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,080
I was sitting on the balcony, uh, drinking hide-it-in.

168
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,640
Oh, yeah, listen into, uh, the DSC.

169
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,760
Gotta drink the hide-it.

170
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
Yeah, as I'm shit, man.

171
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm going to rip off an audio comment to him.

172
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
And, so we don't expect you to play this.

173
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,880
Don't want you to play this, it's just, uh, just a dude.

174
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,440
If your life is worth living, it's worth documenting, and it's worth podcasting.

175
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,920
You know, trying out the, actually, this is a, uh, Sony IC recorder.

176
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,720
There you go.

177
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,680
MP3 player recorder and, uh, never really recorder.

178
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,960
And I'm just, um, a little bit of voice for business, but nothing for my podcast.

179
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,680
It's kicking ass.

180
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,320
I love this sound.

181
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,080
I thought, heck, I'll just try it out.

182
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,640
Yeah, so I plugged my mic in in, plugged my headphones in it.

183
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,680
And I'm sitting in the balcony, basically chillin.

184
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,480
Such a thrill-see.

185
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,640
Um, but that's awesome, man.

186
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
I, I heard, uh, Friday show.

187
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,400
And, um, maybe Thursday, Thursday or Friday.

188
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,280
Whenever you posted the, uh, the thing about Patricia,

189
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,000
on the Dutch TV, I went to your website, and I saw it, and I played it.

190
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,840
If you know, this is almost like, uh, a little recap of, uh, the past couple days.

191
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,080
I, it's, it's, it's, it's even taking me back now.

192
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,160
And once again, I'm so happy to be alive.

193
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,320
And the comments, and damn man, you're right, I didn't understand anything.

194
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,120
It was pretty wild, pretty surreal being, uh, America.

195
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:39,280
And, uh, and seeing, uh, Dutch TV, and just seeing the mannerisms and, and how they talk, and how they walk out.

196
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,760
Don't you think they, it sounds like they're gonna throw up at any moment, but all the sounds,

197
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,360
they're gonna throw up at any moment.

198
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:57,440
Hey, um, you know, it's very, it's sort of like watching Lano kind of, or Carson, but, uh, in Dutch, um,

199
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,120
very awesome. And, uh, I've been listening Patricia on your show,

200
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,720
I guess, from the beginning, and uh, I've always had this image over.

201
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,480
I've seen a couple pictures over, but I, I don't know any of her history other than through you.

202
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,360
And, um, man, what a woman, huh?

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,040
But, uh, no, no, you mean, or what?

204
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,040
Oh, you mean, uh, you mean, uh, what, uh...

205
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,360
What a woman, a half, I think is what you mean.

206
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,880
Oh, yeah!

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,520
Nothing gets more excited than talking about my wife.

208
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,080
She is in The Secret House!

209
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,120
You call it my friend, woman of hell!

210
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Owls.

211
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,620
She's right to my turn.

212
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,120
I'm just letting it all in.

213
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,620
Owls.

214
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,120
She's right to my turn.

215
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Owls.

216
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Owls.

217
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,120
I like names that mess up back.

218
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
I ain't holding up in back.

219
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Owls.

220
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
She's right to my turn.

221
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
Owls.

222
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
All right.

223
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
I shouldn't play anymore than that.

224
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,120
I'm going to get in trouble for her.

225
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Oh, hold on a second.

226
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
I screwed that up.

227
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Shit.

228
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Polynesians.

229
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
Oh, sorry.

230
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
My name's Darren.

231
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
I'm a boxer in the UK.

232
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Although at the moment, I'm out in sunny San Diego on a business trip.

233
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Oh, man.

234
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
The audience is traveling this week.

235
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
And of course, with time on my hands.

236
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
I've been listening to the daily source code.

237
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Okay.

238
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
What do you mean time on your hands?

239
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Excuse me.

240
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,120
This should be planned in your schedule.

241
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Question for you.

242
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Now, when radio back in the old days,

243
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,120
had to be licensed.

244
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,120
And there were a lot of people who are against the man.

245
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
They would get on to a boat,

246
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,120
sail the boat out into international waters

247
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
and broadcast from out there.

248
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Now, using AM.

249
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Of course, the signal travel a lot further than FM receivers did.

250
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,120
And they were able to be listened to by a lot of the country.

251
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Despite the fact they're running out of a boat in the country.

252
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
A boat in the middle of the sea.

253
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
Okay.

254
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,120
So I know exactly what's coming because this comparison has been made many times.

255
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,120
I think I can think I can address it.

256
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,120
So yeah, the pirate ships that you're the pirate radio ships you're referring to.

257
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,120
Like me, me go Caroline, radio Veronica, radio and North Sea.

258
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Their whole deal was, look, the spectrum that is being used in international waters

259
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
belongs to no one.

260
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
So we can just use that spectrum.

261
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,120
And indeed, as long as they stayed out of the territorial waters,

262
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,120
which of course didn't happen because they broke anchor

263
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,120
and they would wash ashore and all kinds of shit like that would happen.

264
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
But if we're all in tens and purposes,

265
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,120
they were operating legally within the limits of all of the international countries

266
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
that were surrounding this broadcast.

267
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,120
So yeah, you know, no other laws applied, I guess.

268
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Now, how does international positioning affect

269
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:04,120
these ASCAP BMI requests with regards to the streaming internet radio?

270
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:11,120
I'm sure that, like BBC, they stream a lot of their radio stations over the internet.

271
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Are they going to be exempt from this?

272
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Or was to stop people from putting their server in Mexico?

273
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Does it matter where the server is based as to where the,

274
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,120
the licensing fees need to be collected?

275
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,120
I'm sure that there's some kind of a technical rule about it somewhere,

276
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
but I just wonder what it is.

277
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
Yeah, thank you very much.

278
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,120
Yeah, sure. So this refers to the web radio streaming fees for playing licensed music.

279
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,120
Well, yes, that only applies to the United States as such.

280
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Sound exchange, I believe it's just a US organization that is collecting fees.

281
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
So if something is played on a web stream,

282
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,120
even if you have a web stream, you have to pay a default of $500.

283
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,120
Regardless of whether you even put anything on it, mind you.

284
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,120
And that is a statutory copyright.

285
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
So you have to pay for it.

286
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Now, to get to your question, yeah, sure.

287
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
If the server is in a different country, that's one thing,

288
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
but it's not just about the server.

289
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
It's really about the business.

290
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,120
So if you're running a business in the US and you have your servers somewhere else,

291
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
it's just not, it's not going to work.

292
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
They're going to come and collect anyway because that's pretty ubiquitous,

293
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
because you can get to the stream from anywhere.

294
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
If the company is actually set up in a different country,

295
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,120
then I think you're going to adhere to the local laws.

296
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
By the way, it's the same with ASCAP BMI.

297
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
There's the Buma STEM Rine in the Netherlands.

298
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
There's Gemma in Germany.

299
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,120
There's, uh, I keep forgetting what it is.

300
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,120
RPCSA.

301
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,120
The UK RSPCA.

302
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
And they have their own set of rules.

303
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,120
And I think you've been probably just compared to, well,

304
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
so lots of porn sites are set up in Amsterdam,

305
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,120
and the businesses are also set up in Amsterdam.

306
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,120
And look at it like all the poker websites.

307
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Sure, they're operating legally by operating offshore,

308
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,120
but the minute one of the executive sets foot on the US soil,

309
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,120
boom, he's arrested.

310
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
Uh, so that's not going to work.

311
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
There's no way around it.

312
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
Look, this is life.

313
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
This is the way it goes.

314
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Both Brian Longa said are some on from Pod Show,

315
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,120
and Sir Jersey Todd are, um,

316
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
Ambulance Chaser.

317
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,120
But also a fine and very competent attorney.

318
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
He said the same thing.

319
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Look, this is just the beginning.

320
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
All this shit is it's going to be changing more things.

321
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
It's going to be fights that's going to be all kinds of stuff

322
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,120
going on to, to come up with some proper jurisprudence.

323
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,120
And I think this one, uh, we just kind of lost.

324
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,120
We can fight for a change in the fees.

325
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Um, I'm happy that you can still always license your music.

326
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,120
To any other individual organization, um,

327
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,120
for a certain uses such as Pod Safe Music.

328
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Uh, but we're pretty much stuck with it the way it is.

329
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,120
And I thanks for the audio comment too.

330
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
Hey, come on, come on, guys.

331
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
I need more phone calls.

332
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,120
I need more advanced calling in.

333
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
What nylon?

334
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
Where the hell are you?

335
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:09,120
I've sworn to a one six to five six three five seven

336
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Last one to a one six to five six three five seven.

337
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
I don't know.

338
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,120
This is Alice there from the Eclipse podcast.

339
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Proud member of the BET pod show network.

340
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,120
We've got a bit of a crisis and I'm asking for your help.

341
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,120
Now I don't know if you've seen on the UK and use this week.

342
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Literally, just in the last couple of days or so.

343
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,120
A three year old called Madeline McCann has disappeared.

344
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Whilst the family were on holiday in Portugal.

345
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Now, another Charlie's got an amazing audience.

346
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Very interactive.

347
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Very keen to get involved.

348
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,120
And I'm hoping you've got a bunch of listeners in Portugal itself.

349
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,120
So what I'm doing is I'm emailing all the podcasters on her.

350
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Sending on picture of Madeline.

351
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,120
And asking if they could make reference to the case.

352
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,120
And perhaps link to the BBC news article to show people this is a genuine

353
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
Emergency appeal.

354
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,120
If people would be prepared to replace the normal album art that they put out

355
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,120
this show with the photograph of Madeline, that would spread the photograph

356
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
far and wide as well.

357
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
I want you to use the power of new media social networking.

358
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,120
It doesn't matter if you pod show a BET pod show.

359
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Forget about young versus the Brits.

360
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Let's have young working with Brits to try and look at this lost child.

361
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,120
Yes, the local place will be working with the European.

362
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Trying to track this child down.

363
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
But let's show them the power of podcasting.

364
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Let's make it a change in someone's life.

365
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,120
This family must be going through absolute living health.

366
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,120
A broad with one of their own missing.

367
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Thanks very much Adam.

368
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
I hope you've got the chance to play this.

369
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,120
And that you can replace your album art just for one day.

370
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
That's what we'll be doing at the Eclipse podcast.

371
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Yeah, of course.

372
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Excellent idea.

373
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,120
And you know, even though you're, I'm almost immediately inclined to think

374
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
what what difference is that going to make?

375
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
It could just make the difference.

376
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
So I'm happy to oblige our place.

377
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,120
The beautiful picture of myself with the picture of Madeline.

378
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
Yeah, it's, it's interesting.

379
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
This story has been alive for three or four days.

380
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,120
And it has pretty much dominated a lot of the, of the British medium.

381
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Not quite sure why.

382
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Of course, you know, maybe it's just a slow newsweek.

383
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,120
But obviously, whenever a child is gone missing and it is every parent's nightmare

384
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,120
for this to happen while you're on holiday and they're in Portugal.

385
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,120
And, you know, they only had her out of her sight for a minute.

386
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,120
I mean, you know, all, it's all the memes that every single parent gets freaked out

387
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
by.

388
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,120
So I'm sure that's why, you know, particularly on a quote, slow newsweek.

389
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
It's dominating the media.

390
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,120
But obviously, that's great for the, for the family.

391
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,120
So that they have more chance of finding their child.

392
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
It's, it's messed up, man.

393
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
That's really messed up.

394
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,120
So yeah, oh, of course I'll put the, the album, Martin.

395
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,120
And if you're in Portugal and you're listening, I know we have a couple listeners

396
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
there.

397
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,120
Let me know if, if it's bigger than news in Portugal as well, if people are really into it.

398
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,120
You know, if there's, if there's pictures post that all over the place.

399
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Um, if not, if you're in Portugal, please try and pass on the word.

400
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Uh, doing as much as I can to help, of course.

401
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
Jim Funfain and Dale sent me an email.

402
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,120
Said, hey, you know, I love the fact that you played Venus on the football Friday.

403
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Let me just play a little bit of that for you again.

404
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
To remind you what it sounds like.

405
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Did you know that that song was inspired by the banjo song of the big three.

406
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
And he sent a link.

407
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Oh, I love that part.

408
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Um, and let's see, this is a link that of course I'll put in the show notes.

409
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,120
And let's see, uh, so late, uh, Mariska Ferris on vocals.

410
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Roby Funlay with the band's league guitars.

411
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
We're seeing the writing credit for the song.

412
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
You know the tune right.

413
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
You've heard it a million times.

414
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Me the first time was the 1980s cover version by banana ramma.

415
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
But have you heard this?

416
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Based upon the traditional Osuzana, the writing credit goes to Tim Rose,

417
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,120
who released it in 1963 on the roulette record label.

418
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
It's called the banjo song.

419
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
You got to hear this.

420
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
This is unbelievable.

421
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Let me just play the intro again.

422
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
And then I'll go straight into this banjo song here.

423
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
So this is the shocking blue.

424
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,120
All right, we recognize that, right?

425
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Okay.

426
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,120
Now check out the, uh, the big three with the banjo song.

427
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Oh, man.

428
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,120
He's got it.

429
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,120
Yeah, baby.

430
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
She's got it.

431
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
We need to do a mashup of this.

432
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,120
Well, I come from Alabama top.

433
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,120
Pull it up and chew on honey.

434
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,120
Oh, well, I'm hit on it.

435
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,120
That Ole Miss is safe.

436
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Got it.

437
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
Oh, man.

438
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Waiting for me.

439
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Oh, Oh, oh! She's got it.

440
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Oh, she doesn't.

441
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
Yes, baby.

442
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
She's got it.

443
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,120
That's awesome.

444
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Awesome.

445
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,120
I'll be with the B&G and jail on my desire.

446
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Crap, let's go in, I'll eat her ain't so hot and not I left

447
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,120
No end to a table stall

448
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:57,120
So I'm hit on a bed, oh my dear river, where the sun gonna keep me from on a wall

449
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Oh, oh, she's got it

450
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Don't cry for me

451
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Cause I'm gonna see you and I'll eat the beach

452
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Oh, I know it's fine

453
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Wait

454
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
I wonder could I just sink those two up? What would happen?

455
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
Let me say

456
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Almost like only 20, yeah, I'll queue it up here

457
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,120
Okay, let's try it again, let's see if it works

458
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,120
It is a different tempo, I don't think it's gonna work very well

459
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,120
Okay, it's time for our savonth from our series of the circle of savonth

460
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
I'm the Sultan of savonth

461
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,120
I think I'm gonna be able to get at least one savonth in episode

462
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,120
There's a fast forward button on there for a reason

463
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,120
I think I'm gonna be able to get at least one savonth in episode

464
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,120
There's a fast forward button on there for a reason

465
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,120
And I hope to be able to talk to savonth every single day

466
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,120
So long

467
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,120
And by the way, I want you to know that this format changed

468
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,120
Doesn't mean that I don't stand one to make a picture

469
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Make a picture, make a picture, make a picture and the salt in a sense of on savonth

470
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,120
Atomic Rod Jackson with an update

471
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,120
I had a atomic rod at him's here with an update on the atomic controversy

472
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,120
Apparently our last discussion took place on an anniversary for the anti nuclear industry

473
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:44,840
nuclear industry. On May 1st, 1977, an army of protesters calling themselves a clamshell

474
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,360
alliance sat down on the site of the Seabook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire, eventually

475
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,640
more than 1,400 people were arrested for trespassing. At least one person who was there,

476
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,000
Paul Gunter, liked the event so much they made anti-nuclear activism his career. According to

477
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,040
an article published in the Toronto Star on the 7th of May, Gunter says he has been trying to drive

478
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:12,600
a state through the heart of the nuclear industry since 1975. Gunter's position is becoming

479
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,600
more isolated every day. Last week the intergovernmental panel on climate change, the IPCC stated

480
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,640
that nuclear power was one of the technologies that should be used to combat global warming.

481
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,680
The third way a progressive think tank aligned to the Democratic Party recently issued a

482
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,960
policy memorandum asking environmentalists to support nuclear energy as a means of reducing

483
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,680
pollution and providing secure energy supplies. In the 30 years since 1977 we have developed ways

484
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,640
to address the remaining issues associated with atomic energy. Charlie listeners even know

485
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,400
the Al Gore's recent comment to the U.S. Senate that reactors quote come in only one size,

486
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:57,160
extra large, and quote, his bogus since they understand that there are small and even extra

487
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,920
small reactors on the drawing boards at Adam's atomic engines incorporated. I've given a quote

488
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,560
that old fashioned people like Paul Gunter will open their minds to new information,

489
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,160
but at least I know that there are some charter listeners that are getting the message that

490
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,640
atomic energy provides some hope for a better future. If they want more than snippets,

491
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,200
they can listen to the atomic show at atomic.thepodcastnetwork.com

492
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:40,600
So we were planning on launching the suckless zone. I believe yesterday and of course as always

493
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,440
there's a couple of snags and we've been through it a million times. You go and check the verification

494
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:51,720
email and then it looks like shit and you got to fix all the words and the from line and everything.

495
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,360
So I'm still hoping it's going to launch this week because I do want you guys to participate.

496
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,320
Not already people are standing in comments and ways for us to, well quite frankly, the suck

497
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:07,000
last and it's much appreciated. Candy Man looked with an idea next.

498
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:15,880
Help us suckless, help us suckless, help us suckless, help us suckless, help us suckless, help us suckless

499
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,040
, help us suckless, help us suckless, help us suckless, help us suckless.

500
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:30,440
Hi Adam, it's the candy man speaking listen, I think I may have a solution to bring

501
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:38,600
bring up what shows you what design to the next level. A couple of researchers of the University

502
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:45,720
of Oxford have devised mathematical formula for describing the ultimate perfect website.

503
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,920
And as you grab a piece of paper and a pen, I'll give it to you now.

504
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,840
All right, all right. I'm ready. I'm ready.

505
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:11,660
Go. B website equals 14.14 times E's nerve plus 13.56 times speed plus 13.11 times 3.

506
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:27,660
this plus 10.89 times funk plus 10.89 times up minus 12.63 times folks plus 10.32 times

507
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:35,860
ads plus 5.21 times multi m and then you divide the whole thing by 6.26.

508
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:45,860
I think that's pretty clear and then there are a couple of other data points here in this research also about the infinite users.

509
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:52,860
18% of people find that easy navigation should be the most important feature of website.

510
00:28:52,860 --> 00:29:03,860
62% think that fast or quickly loading the page would be very important and 49% think that the functionality is very important.

511
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:18,860
80% actually said that simple and clear design is the most important feature of website and only 6% of the interviewed people said that multi-media and fresh content is important.

512
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:27,860
So I suggest you just put this into your product development pipe and we all look forward to seeing the results in a couple of four months fine.

513
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
Thanks.

514
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,860
But spoken like a true sales guy.

515
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,860
That is interesting.

516
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,860
Luke, you should tell me a link to that formula.

517
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,860
And it sounds like it kind of makes sense.

518
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,860
What parts are important?

519
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:46,860
Navigation, speed, cleanliness, functionality, only 49%.

520
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:53,860
I'd like to know who the respondents were or the survey takers or how they came up with that so please send me a link.

521
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,860
I'm very open listening to all that stuff and of course I agree in general with most of it.

522
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,860
Although I'm surprised by the functionality.

523
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,860
So that sounds like a very lean back crowd.

524
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,860
You just want to be entertained and don't really want to do anything.

525
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,860
I don't know if that's what we're looking forward.

526
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:19,860
We're very happy with the creators and I'd have to say the like, what's the word?

527
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,860
Contributors.

528
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,860
That I don't register the pod show because we do have a nice little nucleus.

529
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,860
By the way, did you find the videos?

530
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,860
There's like a soft, soft core porn group.

531
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,860
And they've uploaded videos like 300 of them to their profile pages.

532
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:45,860
I'm not even going to tell you because if you find one, you'll find them all because they all have each other in their entourage and stuff.

533
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,860
I got to tell you.

534
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:53,860
We're going to put, of course, an explicit and 18 viewing thing, whatever we have to do legally.

535
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,860
We're going to put that on there, but it's hot, man.

536
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:10,860
It's really, really cute girls walking around in short skirts, walking in bathrooms and flashing in hotel rooms, trying on lingerie.

537
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,860
It makes no man smile.

538
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,860
Jucks and orbs and darts and gourds.

539
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,860
Elmer futs and bouncing booters.

540
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,860
Sweater stretchers, long protectors.

541
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,860
Beach umbrellas, frost detectors.

542
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,860
Scooby Snacks and snake eyes dice.

543
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,860
Jello molds and hyping lights.

544
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:42,860
Every day I probably use 99 words for boobs.

545
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,860
We're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we're going to put that on there, but we

546
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:27,140
bring it up there.

547
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:58,260
Magic ear muffs, warming clothes, strobes and probes and frontal lobes, knockers, bonkers,

548
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:05,700
nigger bonkers, smurf sand screaming, yellow zongers, tanning cannons, Mr. Viggs, Big Bad Wolfs and

549
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:12,700
Forty Pigs, jogging partners sailing youths, 99 words for boobs.

550
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:31,700
Two point jumpers, bambies, thumpers, rubber, baby buggy bumpers, root up Vegas, Kyle Miggas,

551
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Kongo bambos bowling pins, fast pitch soft balls, signage twins,

552
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,700
your claims I'm breast obsessed are true.

553
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,700
We're quite a pair because I'm a boob.

554
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
I love that.

555
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,700
Robert Lund, 99 words for boobs, it is pod safe and as far as we can see,

556
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,700
because it's parody, it is completely clear.

557
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,700
I've never heard of Picasso's cubes.

558
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,700
Nor do I think I've heard of ear muffs for midgets.

559
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,700
Definitely two new ones for you.

560
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
You've got any send them along.

561
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,700
