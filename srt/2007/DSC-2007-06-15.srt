And hey make sure everybody takes full advantage of it.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It only comes once a year.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Make sure the kids cook your breakfast, fetch your slippers, fetch the paper,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
get a job, sort of supporting themselves

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So what are they're only six.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They're still sweatshops around, they can make clothes for Walmart

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But hey, on the DSC 619

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Happy Fubar, Father's Friday

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:20,760
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I'm justing kids that I'm Korean.

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Okay, baby, I'll close my mouth and watch the time be safe.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Back to the music.

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,760
We'll fire Friday.

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,760
In the sunshine, I'm laughing in the rain.

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Get it on the full shot.

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,760
Rocking in the gray.

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Got no time to run my bed.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,760
But that's not the goal.

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Got a date, can't be late, but I can't get it full.

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
I'll get it.

33
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Ooh, yeah.

34
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:28,760
I'm here to go.

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,760
Think I can we understand.

36
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,760
The horrible game, the good good things

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,760
And the things, the last day I give you the thing and the mountains

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,760
That the ocean, that the birds.

39
00:02:45,760 --> 00:03:15,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

40
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:45,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

41
00:03:45,760 --> 00:04:15,760
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

42
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Oh, yeah, sure it's fine

43
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,760
No, my, my

44
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,760
What a beautiful day

45
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,760
Yeah, yeah

46
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Oh, yeah, sure it's fine

47
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,760
Oh, yeah

48
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Oh, yeah, sure it's fine

49
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Oh, yeah, sure, sure

50
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:19,760
Yeah, we've had your bank whose life is smoking, huh?

51
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Law of girls from New York and five safe and proven it by being on the network.

52
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,760
Less zeppelin.

53
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,760
The ocean.

54
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,760
On a provide Friday with Max from Music and I don't know what happened then.

55
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,760
The phone line just opened wide up and it's unbelievable the amount of stuff that's come in.

56
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
I'm in Washington DC today.

57
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
You've caught me in transit.

58
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
We had a couple meetings here this morning.

59
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,760
So we took the red eye last night from San Francisco.

60
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
I'll tell you more about that later on.

61
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,760
And about two hours from now I get picked up.

62
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
And I'm going home.

63
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
I'm going home a whole day earlier.

64
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,760
I wonder, should I tell Patricia,

65
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,760
do you want to get rid of the boyfriend before I get the end?

66
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Adam, this is Paul.

67
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
I was commenting on there.

68
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
I am commenting on 16th.

69
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
I just listened to, you know.

70
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
I got two comments about that.

71
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
One is the sign you've played at the end.

72
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Mr. Gentry, sign there is.

73
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Yeah.

74
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Excuse me.

75
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,760
Pause because I think about that you are now creating the soundtrack of my life.

76
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
Yes.

77
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,760
Because I thought back when I first started listening to your show.

78
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,760
And that was one of the songs that you played quite often.

79
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
And I forgot how great that song is.

80
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,760
And I'm going to try to track that down and make a purchase.

81
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
So thank you for that.

82
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,760
The other thing is the nylon.

83
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
He's excruciating sometimes.

84
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,760
This guy is excruciating.

85
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
But that out.

86
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,760
As your voice now.

87
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
Oh yeah.

88
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Thanks a lot, buddy.

89
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Yep.

90
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
I guess what?

91
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
He's back again today.

92
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Another appearance from the nylon on the Charlie.

93
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,760
Speaking of the soundtrack to your life.

94
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Hit test on the way.

95
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,760
And another massive suggestion from Dr. Hart.

96
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,760
Now girls want to light your fat bottom on fire.

97
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
I know we still live for this year baby.

98
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
I'm feeling your honor.

99
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
I'm so clean.

100
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Call out that I feel like something.

101
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
So what if I said it baby.

102
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
I'm still one teller.

103
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
I hope you're as big a good one alone.

104
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
And they're on my lesson.

105
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
It's must look around which I remember failure.

106
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Yeah.

107
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
Yeah.

108
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
So I love my power from now.

109
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
Yeah.

110
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
See the police going down.

111
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
You're fooling around with the cops.

112
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Did I kill you near?

113
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
No one behind me.

114
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
Now I need to build this show.

115
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,760
You're stuck at my command and time I see that it's skit here.

116
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
And more bang on the side of your head.

117
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Watch out your ass.

118
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
Where I spill all of the sign of the men now.

119
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
You smell what you do.

120
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
You can't make me your age.

121
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Will you change what you initially said?

122
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
But come with me.

123
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Good day.

124
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
But fuck on me.

125
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
Cause now we vibe in and talking and shit.

126
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
I'm not the head of your ass going.

127
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
When you walk in and shit.

128
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

129
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,760

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

131
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,760
And you give it all you got back.

167
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,720
I can't stop, ride!

168
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,720
It's court, free to step on a girl,

169
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Mass stuff and fuss your eyes, light your ass on fire!

170
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,720
And this link in the show notes will take you to the matchup directly,

171
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,720
you can download it from free again thanks to Dr. Art

172
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,720
for mashuptowns.com

173
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Oh man!

174
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,720
I was talking, actually.

175
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Of course, the lady Patricia knows I'm coming home a day early, I was just messing with you.

176
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,720
And she's happy because that means we'll have a real father's day celebration on Sunday.

177
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,720
That is if my daughter remembers me.

178
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Well, maybe when I park that pink mini in the garage, she'll remember.

179
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,720
So I told her, hey, excuse me, a couple of people.

180
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
We're going to meet.

181
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
That's what I said yesterday.

182
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
I can meet a couple of people in D.C.

183
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,720
So I'm going to take the red eye and run a fly with me and run a fly back.

184
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,720
And I'll just keep headed towards keep going east and come on home.

185
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,720
You guys will be fucking anything for that company.

186
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,720
I said, yep, you better believe it.

187
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Also, we had lunch with an internet pioneer.

188
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,720
Legend, I should say, Ted Leones is from America online from AOL,

189
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,720
who run and I both know from our previous company.

190
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,720
And of course, Ted has done some amazing things in AOL

191
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,720
for I thought it was like 15 years or something like that.

192
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
And he basically almost single-handedly turned around

193
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
in parts of this town.

194
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,720
You know, he built a stadium in some derelict part of town.

195
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,720
And now that's turned into a, and it really into a cool city centre almost.

196
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Very inspirational guy.

197
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,720
It's still kind of a kid from Brooklyn from Greek descent.

198
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,720
You know, that was great.

199
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,720
And so yeah, right now it's, it's five minutes to seven.

200
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,720
So of course, I'm late with, with Charlie,

201
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
but I know that my friends in Australia,

202
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
they love the footballer Friday.

203
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
They love to listen to it on Tuesday.

204
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Hey Adam, this is Brian.

205
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,720
No, I'm sitting on my front porch with a tall glass of water.

206
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Nice.

207
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
After a nice left or even walk.

208
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
And just wanted to get in touch to let you in.

209
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,720
By the way, Brian, who, who works at Potcia,

210
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
well, from his home, and he's a team with PWB,

211
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,720
and they do all kinds of, all kinds of stuff.

212
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,720
In fact, we're about to resurrect podfinder US with the team.

213
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
So stay tuned for that.

214
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
I'll just let Brian finish.

215
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,720
The listeners know about a new podcast that I've started.

216
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,720
The address is fit after 50. podshow.com.

217
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,720
That's, if I T-A-F-T-E-R-5-0. podshow.com.

218
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,720
And basically, I've let myself get in terrible shape

219
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,720
over the past 10, 15 years.

220
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
And put on a bunch of weight.

221
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,720
And I have high blood pressure.

222
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,720
And my lower back is miserable.

223
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
And I'm just a mess.

224
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
And a side that I've had enough of it.

225
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,720
So I'm going to do my best to get fit and stay that way

226
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
the rest of my life.

227
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
I haven't done anything really crazy so far.

228
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Just been watching my diet and exercising.

229
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,720
And I've lost 10 pounds over the past two weeks.

230
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,720
So I doubt that I'll make that kind of progress from here

231
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
on out, but it's an encouraging start.

232
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,720
And wanted to, first of all, just document my progress

233
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,720
in my journey, just pull myself.

234
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,720
But also thought there might be something to begin

235
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,720
in sharing this with other people.

236
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,720
So again, that address is fit after 50. podshow.com.

237
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Speedupodshow.com, I better get back to work.

238
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
See you later.

239
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
I'm Brian Fentastic.

240
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,720
You know, I got to tell you ever since I quit smoking at tobacco.

241
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,720
And of course, that also means by default that I'm not smoking

242
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,720
anything else during the day because you can't take it.

243
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Can't take it in its pureness factor.

244
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Not if I have to actually function.

245
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,720
And it's been kind of inspirational for people.

246
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
I've gotten a lot of support, first of all, again,

247
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,720
thank you so much, everyone who's who's been cheering me on.

248
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,720
I tell you that in Los Angeles, the whole day

249
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,720
and thing about smoking at all, I thought that was a pretty big win.

250
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,720
And so now you get stuff like this, you know, and that's cool.

251
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,720
But of course, Brian, I think I should make a channel.

252
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
And we're going to talk about channels again today.

253
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
I'll probably make a channel.

254
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Or I'll certainly put your first episode in my combo feed.

255
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,720
I have a new combination feed, which is essentially daily source code.

256
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,720
So you get every new episode of this show.

257
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,720
And anything I talk about that I, of course,

258
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,720
if I remember, I'll put single episodes into the feed.

259
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Actually, I'll talk about that in a second.

260
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,720
First of all, Brian, I really appreciate what you've done.

261
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
It fit over 50, great idea.

262
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,720
But of course, you could also just, uh,

263
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
exercise.

264
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,720
I've been a stand-up.

265
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
I got these props, Amy.

266
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
I'll be gay, please.

267
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,720
I'm supposed to do with these paper blades, Amy.

268
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Hey, Adam.

269
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Amy Mac.

270
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Thank you so much for bringing this on with you,

271
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
to San Francisco.

272
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Oh, no.

273
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Oh, no.

274
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
You are the sunshine in San Francisco.

275
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
No, today you're going to need a prop,

276
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
which should have been given to you by Chris, yes.

277
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
I got them two paper plates.

278
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Yes, they are paper plates, I know.

279
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
What do I do?

280
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
We're going to start standing.

281
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Okay, hold on.

282
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
You want one foot on each one of the plates.

283
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
I'm going to be careful.

284
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
You can leave your shoes on or go barefoot,

285
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
it's really up to you.

286
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Let me take off my socks.

287
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Now bend your knees.

288
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Okay.

289
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Lean forward a little bit.

290
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Yeah.

291
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
We want you to feel like you're in a strong athletic stance.

292
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Oh, okay.

293
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
You there?

294
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Yeah, I'm there.

295
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Now slide your right foot out toward the right.

296
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Yep.

297
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
And then slide your left foot into it.

298
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,720
And again, right foot out.

299
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Okay, I get it.

300
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Follow with the left.

301
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,720
It should feel almost like a slow motion gallon.

302
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Good.

303
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Now the opposite.

304
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
So left foot to the left.

305
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,720
And slide the right foot in next to it.

306
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Left one more.

307
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Yeah.

308
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
It's kind of weird.

309
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Good.

310
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Let's do two more slides to each side.

311
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Right.

312
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Squeeze that button.

313
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Oh.

314
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Make it a wide slide.

315
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
And last time right.

316
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
And then bring it together.

317
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Good.

318
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Now left.

319
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Do I breathe?

320
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Stay facing forward.

321
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
I suppose to breathe.

322
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Last one.

323
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Ah.

324
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Great job.

325
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
You're such a good sport.

326
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Like even exercising with paper plates.

327
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Now that's dedication.

328
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Baby.

329
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
I'm right.

330
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Have a good weekend.

331
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
And until next time.

332
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Oh, thank you, Amy.

333
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Well, this is great because, you know,

334
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,720
and by the way, you can get us to exercise on its own feed.

335
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
And of course, Amy has the fitness attack.

336
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
It's a huge show on the network.

337
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,720
And she's just cute as a button.

338
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
But.

339
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,720
And she's getting me props, props to play with paper plates.

340
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Even wrote on it.

341
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Be careful.

342
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Kiss, kiss, from Amy.

343
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Happy footballer for our to-at-em.

344
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Into all your listeners.

345
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
A lot of them up.

346
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,720
Now we all have a song that really inspires us.

347
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
I know I have a few.

348
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,720
But I came across one about two weeks ago.

349
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,720
That really, really hit me.

350
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Deep in the heart.

351
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
But it's not pot safe.

352
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Oh, man.

353
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,720
But I know you've been known to play a pot.

354
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
Non-pot safe song from time to time.

355
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
So I'm really hoping you'll play this one.

356
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,720
The name of the group is called Group One Group.

357
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,720
The name of the song is called Love Is A Beautiful Thing.

358
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,720
And if the listeners like it, go to iTunes and download the video.

359
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
They don't even have the song over there.

360
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Just the video.

361
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,720
So get it for $1.99 and support this band.

362
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
And Adam.

363
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Yeah.

364
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,720
If you get in trouble for playing this song, I will fly out from Tampa to San Francisco.

365
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Yeah.

366
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Once every couple of months, in personally,

367
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,720
clean the pod show toilets to help pay off the fine.

368
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Well, have you know that we're all folders at Pod Show?

369
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,720
So I gotta tell you that football is already a big spammer.

370
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
I appreciate it, buddy.

371
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
But you never know.

372
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
I could go to Big House over this one.

373
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
I feel you love could be like this.

374
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
I will pull to protect me through the hard times.

375
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
It always exists.

376
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Me, the hardest stop breakdown.

377
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Make a person who hates love themselves so we can love those around.

378
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
It gives everyone all the things they've done.

379
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
It's not easy, but the freedom will come.

380
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,720
We gotta learn why it needs to be here.

381
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
It's more than loving your life.

382
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
It's making sure you're like this loving your peers.

383
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Now you could just catch my heart.

384
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,720
And we can pop from the past, let the days of the new love start because.

385
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
It's a beautiful day.

386
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,720
It brings together people.

387
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
A better generation.

388
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
I don't like the love.

389
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,720
I can feel the pain.

390
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
All the broken walls.

391
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,720
It's got to start with us.

392
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
And all it takes is love.

393
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,720
It's something you love is love.

394
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Well, I've got to make it clear.

395
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Love the reason we are here.

396
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,720
We're the object of our backship from a guy who holds us in.

397
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,720
And never, never, never, never know anything that we do.

398
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Every time that we love, it's where we fight you now, yeah.

399
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Because you are all alone.

400
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
So make you really love us.

401
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Stop holding onto the past so we can ask him the reason.

402
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
The days of the new love last because.

403
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,720
It's a beautiful day.

404
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,720
It brings together people.

405
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
A better generation.

406
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
It brings together people.

407
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
It's a beautiful day.

408
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
It brings together people.

409
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,720
It's got to start with us.

410
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
And all it takes is love.

411
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
It's something you love is love.

412
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
It's something you love is love.

413
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
It's something you love is love.

414
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
It's something you love is love.

415
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
It's something you love is love.

416
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
It's something you love is love.

417
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
It's something you love is love.

418
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
It's something you love is love.

419
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
It's something you love is love.

420
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
It's something you love is love.

421
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
It's something you love is love.

422
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
It's something you love is love.

423
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
It's something you love is love.

424
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
It's something you love is love.

425
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
It's something you love is love.

426
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
It's something you love is love.

427
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
It's something you love is love.

428
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
It's something you love is love.

429
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
It's something you love is love.

430
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
It's something you love is love.

431
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
It's something you love is love.

432
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
It's something you love is love.

433
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
It's something you love is love.

434
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
It's something you love is love.

435
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
It's something you love is love.

436
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
It's something you love is love.

437
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,720
It's something you love is love.

438
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
It's something you love is love.

439
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
It's something you love.

440
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,720
It's something you love is love.

441
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
It's something you love is love.

442
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
It's something you love is love.

It's something you love is love.

448
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
It's something you love is love.

449
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
It's something you love is love.

450
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:27,720
All right, dude, I'll gladly go to jail over that one.

451
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Light it up.

452
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Love is a beautiful thing.

453
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
That is so nice.

454
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
All right, hurry on over.

455
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
DavidSourceco.com, click on the links.

456
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:44,720
We'll take you to the video and go buy that support for the band because Dan, that is really, really good.

457
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,720
I mentioned earlier that I started a daily source code combo channel.

458
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,720
This is something that right now,

459
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,720
most of the functionality is in Pod Show and a lot of it has been there for a while.

460
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,720
And now I'm working with Andrew and Devon from our engineering team.

461
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
I've got my own developers.

462
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,720
I don't know if I think they're working maybe exclusively on this for the next couple days.

463
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
I sure hope so.

464
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Because there's a couple things that need adjusting in the management of the channels.

465
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,720
If you subscribe to these, the combo channel, I'll put it in the show notes again.

466
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,720
You can put that on your iPod, just through your iTunes.

467
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,720
And I'll put in the RSS, the plain Jane RSS link again as well.

468
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Because these things, it's really cool.

469
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,720
And it gives you an opportunity to create a show, which anyone can receive.

470
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,720
You know, just through our player, the dashboard player, or in this case,

471
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,720
just to make it simple, works on lots of stuff, but in iTunes.

472
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,720
And it enables you to create entertainment for anyone who's subscribed to that show.

473
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Well, you call a channel, but I'll just call it a show.

474
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
It's going to have the same properties.

475
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
So you'll be able to comment on it.

476
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
You'll be able to add it to your own collection.

477
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
If you find someone else's channel.

478
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,720
And you can already see that a lot of things within Pod Show are channelized.

479
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,720
So you can get single episodes, you can get graphics.

480
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Indeed, if you get a song, not everything works right.

481
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
And it's still kind of burpy and crappy.

482
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,720
But the core functionality is working.

483
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
And people are really enjoying it.

484
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Hello, Adam Curry.

485
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,720
This is Daniel Johnson Jr. from Cincinnati, Ohio.

486
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:33,720
I am calling about the Pod Show plus channel concept thing that you guys are talking about.

487
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,720
I really like that Pod Show plus is enabling us to get individual episodes.

488
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,720
I have been using the channel feature for it to subscribe to.

489
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
I'm practically all of my podcast.

490
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,720
I subscribe to over close to 80 feeds.

491
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,720
And instead of having to manage 80 individual subscriptions,

492
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
I can just put them into a couple of channels.

493
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
I have a music channel for all my music podcasts.

494
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,720
And then I kind of put all my video podcasts into one channel.

495
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,720
And then I also have one that I call use for everything else.

496
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Yeah.

497
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,720
So it has been using individual doing individual episodes.

498
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,720
I created a channel just where I can put individual episodes of shows that I'm checking out.

499
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Yeah.

500
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Today I created a channel for selected episodes of one of my favorite podcasts.

501
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,720
And so you need to just like, I've only that podcast.

502
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,720
So if I wanted to recommend it to somebody.

503
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,720
I can say, hey, if you want to learn what's been going on with this particular show.

504
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Just go get my channels.

505
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Check out this speed and you can listen to all the shows and get the idea of what's going on.

506
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,720
This is one of the things that I've been using gigadial for.

507
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Yeah.

508
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
I thought it put together.

509
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,720
And I'm sure that he has been very instrumental in helping to do some more time.

510
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
What project is doing.

511
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
And so definitely looking forward to all the different changes that are going on.

512
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
Again, Daniel Johnson, Jesus Christ.

513
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Since that is Ohio.

514
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
They get a great day at him.

515
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
And thanks so much.

516
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
All right.

517
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Daniel Johnson, Junior, I appreciate it, man.

518
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Yeah, of course.

519
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Andrew has a lot of that knowledge.

520
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
And I'm looking forward to it being applied.

521
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Because imagine.

522
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
Oh, just imagine.

523
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,720
If you could determine the order of output of your channel.

524
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Wouldn't that be nice?

525
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,720
If you could make that distinction and not just have to be by the most recent episode update.

526
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,720
By the way, we have a whole API for this.

527
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,720
Geeks, engineers, people listening in.

528
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
People who don't know what that is.

529
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,720
It's an application programming interface, I think.

530
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,720
It's a way for you to tie into pod shows engine.

531
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,720
It's essentially where all the widgets connect.

532
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Yeah, you've seen widgets all over the place, right?

533
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
It's stuff you embed into a page.

534
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,720
You can put it on your my space or your Facebook or on your weblog.

535
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Wherever you want and a complete stuff.

536
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,720
Yeah, we have an entire API for our channels.

537
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,720
So if you know how to make a widget, you can go to developer.podshow.com.

538
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Amy's boy toy, Chris, the first we call him.

539
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,720
He's actually resurrecting the entire developer program.

540
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,720
And it's working is really now becoming a resource for developers who.

541
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Well, it's interesting because for kind of has a.

542
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
He hasn't been to what I have.

543
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,720
He's actually a pretty good programmer engineer.

544
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Enough to get himself in trouble.

545
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
Let's put it that way.

546
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
But he also understands media extremely well.

547
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,720
So he's the perfect guy to be working with developers on this stuff.

548
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,720
So, and if you make a widget, please ping me.

549
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Let me know.

550
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
I'll put it on my site.

551
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I'll promote the heck out of it.

552
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
You kidding me?

553
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Hello.

554
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Hey, Adam.

555
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
This is Jeff from Northern Michigan.

556
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Nice to meet you.

557
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Hey, the.

558
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,720
You were describing all of stuff that you're doing with the channel feed.

559
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Yeah.

560
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
I've been doing that since I discovered it on podshow.

561
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Some time after you guys were alive.

562
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Really?

563
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,720
It's been the best feature that I think has been ever.

564
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
You guys invented on the whole site.

565
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Because managers, you my content.

566
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,720
And what I listen to on a daily basis through a weekly basis is so much easier.

567
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,720
So, hey, keep up the good work.

568
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
Yo.

569
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Fuller.

570
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
Thanks buddy.

571
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Yeah.

572
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,720
Let me see if I can explain some of the cool features of this.

573
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,720
Because, you know, we generally think of feeds or what we're calling channels.

574
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,720
As, you know, dynamic shows that updates are already.

575
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,720
You know that you can make a channel out of static stuff.

576
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Just single episodes or out of pictures if you want.

577
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Now the pictures won't download to your iPod yet, but working on that.

578
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Actually, that should work with photo casting, I guess.

579
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Hmm.

580
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,720
You have another thing to look at.

581
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,720
But you'll be able to set properties on on items you put into a channel.

582
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,720
So you could say, hey, you know, I want daily source code in my channel.

583
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,720
But I don't want all the episodes in my channel.

584
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
I just want the most recent one.

585
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,720
And you could say, I want the most recent two for that matter.

586
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
It's not done yet.

587
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,720
I don't think, but you'll be able to get people.

588
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,720
And people, of course, have all kinds of stuff.

589
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
They have shows.

590
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
They have their own channels.

591
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
They have shows.

592
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
They listen to.

593
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
They have blog posts.

594
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
They have pictures.

595
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,720
And you'll be able to say, you know what?

596
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,720
From this person, I want every single new show he listens to or every blog post he puts up.

597
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
I mean, the mind boggles.

598
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Particularly when you think that you can put channels into chat.

599
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,720
I, I, I, I, it is not a feature.

600
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,720
It is the feature.

601
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Oh boy.

602
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
It's time for double whammy.

603
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,720
This summer, when you buy Coke, you get music.

604
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,720
You can win an iPod or free songs or nightchains.

605
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
That's right.

606
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,720
Today's hit test is brought to you by Coca-Cola.

607
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
Fantastic.

608
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
With Adam Curry.

609
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Hey, Adam.

610
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
You're having ready to be stumped.

611
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Oh, I'm ready.

612
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
I'm away.

613
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
He used it.

614
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
He doesn't pull back.

615
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Hi, Adam.

616
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Yon Poletti with hit test number 74.

617
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
Again, three very short clips.

618
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
I'm ready.

619
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
And three answers.

620
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
So here we go.

621
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
This is number one.

622
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
Easy.

623
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Easy.

624
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Easy.

625
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
That's not a man.

626
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
A fine, young cannibal.

627
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
She drives me crazy.

628
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Come on.

629
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,720
We sing a top 40 radio station as a recurrent.

630
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
And number two.

631
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Lucky star Madonna.

632
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
I think.

633
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
You might be my lucky star.

634
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
And the final one for this week's hit test.

635
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Oh, it's hard.

636
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
It sounds like a...

637
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
You sound dead a bit.

638
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Don't waste my time.

639
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Jocelyn Brown or something like that.

640
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
And that's it.

641
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
And this is answer number one.

642
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
This was easy.

643
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,720
From 1988 to fine young cannibals.

644
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,720
She drives me crazy.

645
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,720
She drives me crazy.

646
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Oh, sorry.

647
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
You're trying to sing one there.

648
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
Fuck another.

649
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,720
Here it comes.

650
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,720
She drives me crazy.

651
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
Come on.

652
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Come on.

653
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
Come on.

654
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
Come on.

655
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
Yeah.

656
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
Come on.

657
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Oh, man.

658
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
We played that one.

659
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
We just sat on MTV.

660
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
And so number one.

661
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
The fun young cannibals.

662
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
She's a jumping video.

663
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
And this is answer number two.

664
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
Yeah.

665
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
In 1984.

666
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
Oh, yeah.

667
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
This is Madonna.

668
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Who's your daddy?

669
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
Lucky star.

670
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
Oh, man.

671
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
We might not be star.

672
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Because it's just only when ever you are.

673
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Starlight.

674
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Starlight.

675
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
The starlight.

676
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
The starlight.

677
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
The starlight.

678
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
The starlight.

679
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
The starlight.

680
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
Make it.

681
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
All right.

682
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Last one.

683
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
Starlight.

684
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Madonna's answer number two.

685
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
And this is answer number three.

686
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Oh, our castle.

687
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
Oh, our castle.

688
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Yes.

689
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Oh, our castle.

690
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,720
And so number three.

691
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,720
And don't waste my time.

692
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Oh, our castle.

693
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Answer number three.

694
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
And don't waste my time.

695
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
In this edition of the hit test.

696
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,720
Well, that's it.

697
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
For this week.

698
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
See you next week, Adam.

699
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Hope you did well, by the way.

700
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
Yeah.

701
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
And up ahead.

702
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,960
I hope you did well, by the way.

703
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,760
Yeah, I'm up ahead.

704
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
Two and a half stars.

705
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,960
By the way, the show notes and stuff is all up on the...

706
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,760
It tests.

707
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
They're part show.com.

708
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Yeah.

709
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,160
You can also find tracks and iTunes links there.

710
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,160
Oh, and please dig the show.

711
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,760
It's cool to be Dave, right?

712
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay, Adam, see you next week.

713
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,400
Until then, bye-bye.

714
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,480

718
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,200

Hit test.podshow.com.

720
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,000
I, I, I, my forgotten last week,

721
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,720
I'll definitely put a link in this week.

722
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,960
Yon, fantastic job.

723
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,240
Why did I think Jocelyn Brown, my poor hard castle?

724
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,480
But that was one of the first guys

725
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,280
who was like a producer, producer, fantastic.

726
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,920
Love to hear from you.

727
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,680
I'm almost afraid now with all the stuff you guys

728
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,960
you know, dialed in in this in the past like 36 hours

729
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,520
that I won't get anything for next week.

730
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:24,160
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

731
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:32,160
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

732
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,880
Ganna tell you, I'm getting a little bit worried about nylon.

733
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,320
He's called in for the third time this week.

734
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,000
He's not necessarily one of your favorites.

735
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Hey, Adam, it's Doug Pilgrim in Boston.

736
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,400
Listen to anybody has any kids with them right now.

737
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,200
Turn off your MP3 player.

738
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,680
It's gonna be all explicit.

739
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,720
Hey nylon, do a solid favor and tighten up on your loafers.

740
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,080
Pull the panties out of your ass and shut the fuck up.

741
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,720
Every time you call this show, all you do is complain and wine.

742
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,720
And half the time you got it wrong.

743
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,200
Who are your first call to this show?

744
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,760
All that shit that you were given, Adam,

745
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,880
about the fact that he's not an environmentalist.

746
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,240
Adam never said he was an environmentalist.

747
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,520
Adam was all about Trinity from the alternative energy standpoint.

748
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,920
Had nothing to do with the environment.

749
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,200
I'm the one to introduce that conversation.

750
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,760
You had it wrong then and you've got it wrong now.

751
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,440
You're whining about the fact that Adam is gonna quote,

752
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,320
Pimp his ride, how do you expect a project like this

753
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,920
to get done without any money?

754
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,640
Are you some kind of a goddamn socialist?

755
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,080
Do you want the government to step in?

756
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,400
Shit, like this does not get done unless a sponsor steps are quite frankly.

757
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,280
I don't give a crap if Adam covered that and said he's been.

758
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,920
So it looked like a fucking NASCAR coming down the road.

759
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,840
As long as the project gets done.

760
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,400
So do me a favor and click a cry baby crap and come up with something constructed

761
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,400
and serve just sitting back and feel sad and having all of your goddamn facts.

762
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,560
Oh, whoa, touch a crow baby.

763
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,640
And that whining New York accent of yours,

764
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,120
I swear to God, you must be a Yankees fan.

765
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,920
Thanks, Adam, but I couldn't take a listen to this guy anymore.

766
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,200
And now?

767
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,600
Yeah.

768
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,640
Pot-safe music and that whining.

769
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,520
Well, thank goodness.

770
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,320
Take it back.

771
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,520
Okay, I mean, Bradshaw.

772
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,560
Wow, them spiked words, I'd say.

773
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,760
Not long, but it looked out.

774
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,360
You said I'm gone too ill.

775
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,560
Three cold dry.

776
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,000
And it turned to the river where mudded water floored.

777
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,400
See, I'm tired, I've been carrying the hell below.

778
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,560
So I was born with the moves and bad attitude.

779
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:02,840
I went down to the river, got nothing to do with it.

780
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,440
Take it back.

781
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,640
Take it back.

782
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,920
I don't want you to fall over.

783
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,120
Take it back.

784
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,960
Take it back.

785
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,920
I don't want you to fall over.

786
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:23,240
Take it back.

787
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,440
Take it back.

788
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,280
But where did you go?

789
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,920
Here.

790
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Take us down to the river

791
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,920
Well, he really has the daddy or the ID. He or

792
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,920
Look cover

793
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Take me back for a little bit of first

794
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Take me back

795
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,920
Take me back

796
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
Take me back

797
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920
Take me back

798
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,920
Take me back

799
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Take me back

800
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Take me back

801
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
Take me back

802
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
Take me back

803
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Take me back

804
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
Wow

805
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Great song, great choice, Doug

806
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
And thanks for the email

807
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
We'll be talking sometime next week

808
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
It's going to be really busy next week for me

809
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,920
I got to tell you

810
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,920
Monday, Patricia and I are going to a

811
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
Gala dinner

812
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,920
There's a Gala

813
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
You say Gala

814
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
I say Gala

815
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
It's

816
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
The flight attendants for the

817
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Virgin Atlantic

818
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,920
Have an award ceremony

819
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,920
And they really do this up right

820
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
And Patricia and I was like, let's just go

821
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,920
By the way, if it's flight attendants

822
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,920
It's probably as Gala

823
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
I

824
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Yes, moving up towards the Nylon

825
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Hi Adam, it's Kevin Crossman

826
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
The proud scruncher

827
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
You okay?

828
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
I have a comment in a question about

829
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
Recent pod show events

830
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,920
Okay, rock on

831
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
First comment about

832
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,920
Jonsky before

833
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,920
What ever soft lunch of just podcast

834
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,920
Maybe he didn't want to talk about that

835
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
On Twitter because

836
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,920
Whatever he's doing now

837
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
Just sucks

838
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,920
You know, sometimes you need to soft lunch

839
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
Something kind of see what I was going

840
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,920
But sometimes better to not soft lunch

841
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
Something, I don't know what he's doing

842
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
On his show

843
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,920
It seems like he can't even press record

844
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
On his microphone

845
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Well, I think that's kind of the whole point

846
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,920
Is he really wants to get into this

847
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
He really wants to podcast

848
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,920
So he's got himself a copy of

849
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Cast Blaster, which he likes very much

850
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,920
But, you know, it takes a little bit of work

851
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
He's got the wrong gear

852
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,920
He's got a USB microphone

853
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
Which of course works perfectly

854
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,920
But it no way does

855
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,920
His setup represent what he can sound like

856
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
And what he can do

857
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
So that's why you do a soft lunch

858
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
You can do this all

859
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,920
You know, you can make shows

860
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Five minutes shows every single day

861
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
Imprive it and have, you know,

862
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,920
The pod father review

863
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
The more you could just put it out there

864
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,920
Warts and all, you know, that's

865
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Isn't that kind of what we're about, dude?

866
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
And to be able to produce a show

867
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Without standing multiple versions

868
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,920
Of the same showing to his feet

869
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
I don't know, it shouldn't be that hard

870
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
It wasn't for me

871
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,920
And I'm sure John is getting paid

872
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Big bucks by pod show to do a good job

873
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,920
But he ain't doing it now

874
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,920
And, you know, now he's putting a call out to people

875
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
To say, what does he want to do?

876
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
You know, what the fuck is that about

877
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,920
Because he should be hired

878
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
To know what he wants to do

879
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
That's crazy

880
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,920
Oh man, come on, I talk out of my ass

881
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
All the time

882
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
And that's what you do when you're testing stuff

883
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,920
Stuff out

884
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Go look at the DSC channel

885
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
The little video thing I do every day

886
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,920
It's totally dumb

887
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
But that's because we're testing

888
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
You know, there's a lot of stuff going on

889
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
And he's building channels

890
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
So, I just hang back and relax

891
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
Don't worry, everything's going to be alright

892
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
I am looking forward to the channel concept though

893
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,920
But I would like you to address the high

894
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
High-Jackish who you started around that

895
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
It seems to me that

896
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
You need traditional term of a high-Jack feed

897
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,920
But the gripes of people have

898
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,920
Is that okay?

899
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,920
Now I'm subscribed to this channel

900
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,920
And oh, the straight show is in there

901
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,920
And I'm subscribed to the channel

902
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
But what if the channel goes away

903
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
Now, me as a potcaster

904
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
I lose all those listeners who are subscribed to the channel

905
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
Not to my show directly

906
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,920
So I'd like you to address that

907
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
Sure, that's a question that people have

908
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,920
That being said, anybody who's pretty good at entertainment

909
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,920
We can't all be happy to include

910
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,920
Frappacat.com

911
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
Go ahead and put that in there

912
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
I'll be happy to have you do that

913
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,920
In any case, exactly

914
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
Bruncher

915
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,920
Yes, yes, yes, be quiet

916
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
That's my point exactly dude

917
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,920
Of course you want to have it in all kinds of channels

918
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Because that's going to get you people listening

919
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
And you know what? I got to tell you

920
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,920
I've had problems with channels and feeds and podcast

921
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
And all kinds of stuff

922
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
And if it's something I'd like to listen to

923
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
Find out what's wrong with it

924
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,920
But really what we're doing

925
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Personalised aggregation

926
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,920
That's one way of looking at it

927
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
You can use a widget

928
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,920
The download stuff

929
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
They could be like

930
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,920
RSS feeds

931
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
For blog posts

932
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Lots of millions of people using

933
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,920
Stuff on the desktop to do that

934
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,920
And millions more using

935
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,920
I don't know

936
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
I use Google News

937
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Podcast by the way

938
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
But really we enable you to customize

939
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
Your experience from these feeds

940
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
I think this is pretty unique

941
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,920
You're able to

942
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
Collect I mean, we have incoming feeds

943
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Unbelievable how many feeds are

944
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Incoming into into podshow system

945
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,920
But outgoing there's

946
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,920
A multiple of five more outgoing

947
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,920
Because all of these channels that are being created

948
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,920
And when you can start to connect those channels to each other

949
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,920
It's just more distribution dude

950
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,920
It's like a social RSS network

951
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Hmm

952
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
It's actually something to that

953
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
And that's kind of a reager

954
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
It's got to make a better name

955
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,920
RSS space

956
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,920
I don't know what it is

957
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,920
But it's working and it's not hijacking

958
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,920
It's not the whole point

959
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,920
Is that you know your feed updates

960
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,920
Otherwise all the channels don't update

961
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
Anything that it's in

962
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
So you know hijacking is

963
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Is it really something all together

964
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,920
Different

965
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
So

966
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
I don't think there's an issue to address

967
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
hijacking is when you copy the feed

968
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
And republish a feed by the same name

969
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
Only it's coming from a different source

970
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
So that is something very different

971
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,920
And you already pointed out dude, it's great

972
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
If you're creating a show

973
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Because it just gets you lots more distribution

974
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,920
Whoa, he's an island

975
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,920
Outspoken, expatriate, he's in London

976
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,920
He's from New York

977
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
Oh

978
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,920
He's a island

979
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
Controvers the island

980
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,920
He's in London, but he's from New York

981
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,920
If you didn't think you had enough to bitch about the war act

982
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,920
Mr. Curley

983
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
Mr. Nyla

984
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
I've got palm my hands

985
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,920
I'm sitting here

986
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,920
This Sheraton Pulitzer Hotel

987
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,920
Oh

988
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
Overlooking the pleasing grass

989
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
And Amsterdam?

990
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,920
Yes

991
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
And I was thinking because I got palm on my hands

992
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,920
And I started playing this game called

993
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Google Bingo with you

994
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Which was, you know, I was counting each show

995
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
We have a couple shows

996
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,920
How many times do you say Google

997
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,920
Or reference a Google related

998
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,920
What?

999
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,920
Autoc

1000
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
And then I realized

1001
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,920
Another thing is that, you know,

1002
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,920
Sequoia and your other VC partners

1003
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,920
They will go to some of the initial investors

1004
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,920
On Google

1005
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
That's interesting

1006
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,920
And then I realized

1007
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,920
Okay, my whole rant about the war act

1008
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
You've nothing something here

1009
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,920
He's a brand name

1010
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,920
Wait a minute

1011
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
Are you saying that

1012
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,920
Me talking about Google makes us an acquisition

1013
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,920
That acquisition target for them

1014
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,920
Yeah

1015
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,920
Yeah, they need my business

1016
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,920
Make the guy more attractive

1017
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,920
More credibility

1018
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,920
Yes, he does

1019
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,920
If you force a cranky geek

1020
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,920
With a closet geek

1021
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
What do you get?

1022
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,920
You get an acquisition target

1023
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,920
And I had to slap myself on my head

1024
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,920
How stupid of you?

1025
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,920
That's funny

1026
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,920
Highline, you've been out of New York too long

1027
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,920
That's true

1028
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,920
So I just want you to know Mr. Carrey

1029
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,920
I'm going to be watching you with my Google Bingo each show

1030
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,920
And if I get to sense you got Googly eyes out there

1031
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,920
I don't know what I'm going to do

1032
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,920
Because I know you wouldn't sell out for 100 million

1033
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920
100 million

1034
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,920
100 million

1035
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,920
No boy

1036
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,920
I chose worth more than that

1037
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,920
It's it's my baby man

1038
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,920
Are you out of your mind?

1039
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,920
You're in this for the long run

1040
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Yes

1041
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
But it's all coming together now

1042
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
I see two dots converging

1043
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,920
You don't have the same thing

1044
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
I know the SEC

1045
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,920
But I just want you to know Mr. Carrey

1046
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,920
I'm watching you with the Googly eyes

1047
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,920
It's starting to come together for me

1048
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,920
And me while I'm bipolar

1049
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,920
Because now you got coke on there

1050
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
And you got Tylenol

1051
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
So I take the coke

1052
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,920
And I'm bouncing off the wall

1053
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,920
I take the Tylenol

1054
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
And I'm falling asleep

1055
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,920
Hey dude

1056
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,920
Get sponsors that do the same thing

1057
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,920
I mean I'm bipolar

1058
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,920
You know the coke and Tylenol

1059
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,920
They don't go together

1060
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,920
It's why you're helpful in it again

1061
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,920
So anyway

1062
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,920
Anyway

1063
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,920
I'm watching you Mr. Carrey

1064
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,920
Are you sure you're only bipolar

1065
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,920
My one

1066
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
I know you're long

1067
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,920
Thanks man

1068
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,920
By the way

1069
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,920
If you I was always told this is this a myth

1070
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920
And maybe it is

1071
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,920
I when I was growing up

1072
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,920
There was I guess it's an urban legend or something

1073
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,920
But if you put an aspirin in a girls' coke

1074
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,920
It would be the equivalent of Spanish fly

1075
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,920
So maybe you're just really turned on

1076
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,920
That's why you're calling in three times in one week

1077
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
Nylon

1078
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,920
I appreciate the thought

1079
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,920
But now we have a little bit more work to do

1080
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,920
Before we're let Google buy us

1081
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,920
I'm not going to say

1082
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,920
I got to get these channels work and man

1083
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,920
That's going to take long enough

1084
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
Hey by the way

1085
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,920
So it's starting to work

1086
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,920
I'm starting to get people from podshow HQ

1087
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
Calling in

1088
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,920
So we had sales, we had Greg

1089
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,920
Of course Andrew and Devon will be calling

1090
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,920
And I'm sure Andrew's called it on the show before

1091
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,920
And I've got another one from from A to the B

1092
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,920
With a suck less zone update

1093
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,920
But Jeff Smith was so nice to of course

1094
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
Turn this into an item for me

1095
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,920
Which means we have a jingle

1096
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,920
But I'm bum another day

1097
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,920
At the office

1098
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,920
But I'm bum just saying hello

1099
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,920
But I'm bum

1100
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,920
To the gang from HQ

1101
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,920
But I'm bum

1102
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,920
And podshow

1103
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,920
Yo, Adam and stuff

1104
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,920
It's day to day to the B

1105
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,920
Hey man

1106
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,920
I'm standing outside the pod show HQ

1107
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
Looking at some numbers

1108
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
And it is really fascinating stuff

1109
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,920
As I said

1110
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,920
But let's get real here

1111
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,920
Sorry about that

1112
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,920
So are you a podcaster

1113
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,920
And by the way

1114
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,920
Obviously our panel numbers are building

1115
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,920
So these might not be completely

1116
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,920
You know they're going to be changing over the next summer week

1117
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
Right

1118
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,920
But

1119
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,920
Believe it or not

1120
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,920
45% of the people are a podcaster

1121
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,920
Now when we started this

1122
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,920
More like 80%

1123
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,920
So now it's 40%

1124
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,920
Which is pretty amazing

1125
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,920
And then too

1126
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,920
What type of listener or viewer are you?

1127
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
Please check all that apply

1128
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
Well one of the

1129
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,920
One of the

1130
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,920
Question is do I stick with the shows I like

1131
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,920
And that was 75%

1132
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,920
71% of their passionate about certain programs

1133
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,920
60% always look for new things

1134
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,920
And 53% casually browsing

1135
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,920
Select

1136
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,920
Anyway

1137
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,920
Really cool

1138
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,920
That's a suck less update

1139
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,920
I may be 80 to the B

1140
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,920
I'm so excited

1141
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,920
You almost

1142
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,920
Almost do

1143
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,920
You're getting there

1144
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Yeah, no that's good

1145
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,920
Of course we started with a very high number of podcasters

1146
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,920
And now that's dropped down to 45%

1147
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,920
That's cool

1148
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,920
Which means that the listeners are now coming in

1149
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,920
That's excellent

1150
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,920
And you heard some of the questions there

1151
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,920
And some of the answers

1152
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,920
And I'm sure we'll be updating more

1153
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
I really would appreciate it

1154
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,920
If you took the survey

1155
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,920
Go to

1156
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
There's a couple of ways you can get there

1157
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,920
Survey.podshow.com

1158
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,920
That's the family

1159
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,920
Friendly way to get in

1160
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,920
The questions are remain the same

1161
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,920
And of course

1162
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,920
The suck less zone

1163
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,920
Sockless.podshow.com

1164
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,920
Adam is Chuck from Jersey

1165
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,920
Oh my god man

1166
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,920
You probably back in time

1167
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,920
Listen to that

1168
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,920
Victoria

1169
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
Digital bike there

1170
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,920
Holy

1171
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,920
I miss the victim

1172
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,920
I don't even know the younger

1173
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,920
The younger of you

1174
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,920
But I got to get the see 64

1175
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,920
Did some basic programming myself

1176
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,920
And I love doing that

1177
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,920
I loved the victims

1178
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,920
20 so much

1179
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,920
Yeah, with that kind of wacky

1180
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,920
To hear that computer program

1181
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,920
Oops

1182
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,920
Later on I was there

1183
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,920
I Pipia

1184
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,920
I heard that tone

1185
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,920
All the time

1186
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,920
Anzi text

1187
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,920
And what was the other

1188
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
The other graphics protocol

1189
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,920
We were using we used ANZ

1190
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,920
And we used

1191
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:02,920
Was it rip? I think it was rip was another that was the graphics protocol, I think.

1192
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,920
Oh man, you brought me back. Yeah, it's frightening.

1193
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,920
You go from the Jersey side of things, it's a product. I loved it, man. I thought it was brilliant.

1194
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,920
Really?

1195
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:18,920
The whole thing in terms of we never got closure and everything. It was a series and it was about, you know,

1196
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,920
Tony knocking closure with his uncle and Janice was moving on or anything about her.

1197
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:30,920
And it's just, it's every day life for them and we just don't get to watch anymore.

1198
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,920
You know, first of all, you sound a little too involved in the, in the actual show.

1199
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,920
John DeVourke had a pretty good take on that. He said this, this show got whacked.

1200
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,920
And it happens when you at least expect it. And when I think back on the episode,

1201
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,920
yeah, in a way we were a participant in the show and we got whacked.

1202
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,920
We got whacked in the restaurant. I thought that was a pretty good take on it.

1203
00:48:50,920 --> 00:49:00,920
And I said, I wouldn't be disappointed if Tony's crew and the New York crew had a heat style gun battle in the middle of the street.

1204
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,920
But this just, I don't know, it just works for me.

1205
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,920
All right. You know, you get to everybody gets to interpret who walked in the door or, you know,

1206
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,920
what happened next or anything. I thought it was awesome.

1207
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,920
Anyway, did they hear from you?

1208
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,920
All right, mate. No, I thanks, dude.

1209
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:28,920
Yeah, no, I got to say because if, of course, if that show had ended with a throw down between fills New York crew and, and Antony's jersey crew.

1210
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,920
I mean, I would have been boring because we know that jersey boys would have won.

1211
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,920
Hey, Adam, this is Robin Maude.

1212
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,920
God bought some London.

1213
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,920
Hello.

1214
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,920
I love this. I'm listening to you when they show you mentioned shocker girl.

1215
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,920
I'm going to go take a look at her and my new spam blocker says,

1216
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,920
The site is blocked.

1217
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,920
Yeah.

1218
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,920
The site is trying to fix it, but also category.

1219
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,920
It's computer set to block.

1220
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,920
Soccer girl, Pachelor Cobb, is blocked because it's traffic categorized as...

1221
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,920
Poor guy.

1222
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,920
Yeah.

1223
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,920
Poor guy.

1224
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,920
This is incorrect.

1225
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,920
Please report it by the incorrect rating form.

1226
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,920
Now, here's my, my problem, which is, I like it to be pornography.

1227
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,920
It has to be blocked.

1228
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,920
I have to say it isn't.

1229
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,920
And then it won't be or what's behind it.

1230
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,920
Anyway, I'm sure you know where she was.

1231
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,920
Wow.

1232
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,920
Oh, right now.

1233
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,920
You know, the soccer girl, of course, he's a pretty famous now for bearing her breasts.

1234
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,920
And she's beautiful.

1235
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,920
She's just a stunningly beautiful woman.

1236
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,920
Add to that that she's a librarian.

1237
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,920
And it's just everything I want in a woman.

1238
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,920
And but she, the stuff she does.

1239
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,920
And I'm sorry that you're spam, that you're, you're, you're porn blocker, whatever it is,

1240
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,920
that it's blocked you out.

1241
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,920
I mean, that's, unfortunately, that's either your PC or it's your ISP or, however, that's happening.

1242
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,920
Of course, we don't block that.

1243
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,920
We do put an explicit tag on her.

1244
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,920
But, you know, look, she shows her her body.

1245
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,920
And usually in context with her show, it's not just like, I got to show my body.

1246
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,920
And it's a beautiful body to look at.

1247
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,920
As nothing pornographic about it.

1248
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,920
What's going on in my mind is extremely pornographic.

1249
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,920
But there's nothing pornographic about what she does.

1250
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,920
What she does in her shows is often pornographic.

1251
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,920
But not in the sense of sex, but really in the sex of, oh, my God, you know,

1252
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,920
that you just really messed with my brain.

1253
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,920
It's, it's really, it's an awesome, awesome show.

1254
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,920
How many times can I promote soccer group?

1255
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,920
You deserve a girl.

1256
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,920
All right, I got to catch a plane.

1257
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,920
I got to head out east to get on a beach.

1258
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,920
Branding through fire waves to find it on the TMM.

1259
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,920
Only you would make it, baby.

1260
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,920
As I look down the roadside.

1261
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:48,920
I love to wait that we are.

1262
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:54,920
It could never go away.

1263
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:04,920
It's a feeling that makes you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1264
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,920
All you could make me happy.

1265
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:15,920
All you could make me smile.

1266
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,920
All you could make me happy.

1267
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,920
All you could make me happy.

1268
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,920
All you could make me smile.

1269
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:41,920
All you could make me smile.

1270
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:50,920
All you could make me smile, yeah, yeah.

1271
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:58,920
I only knew to make me happy

1272
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:05,920
I only knew to make you smile

1273
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,920
I only knew to make me happy

1274
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,920
For a while

1275
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,920
I only knew to make you smile

1276
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:28,920
I only knew to make you smile

1277
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,920
I only knew to make you smile

1278
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:53,920
I only knew to make you smile

1279
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,920
I only knew to make you smile

1280
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,920
The other dog can chase the zippers

1281
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:09,920
I only knew to make you smile

1282
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,920
I need you now so I can feel you

1283
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:22,920
I need you now so I can be

1284
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:29,920
I only knew to make me happy

1285
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,920
I only knew to make me smile

1286
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,920
I only knew to make me happy

1287
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,920
I only knew to make me smile

1288
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:53,920
I only knew to make you smile

1289
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:03,920
I only knew to make you smile

1290
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:12,920
I only knew to make you smile

1291
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,920
Fire ape, so you can make me happy

1292
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,920
Brand new you'll find him on the pot

1293
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,920
Safe music network

1294
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,920
Went a little bit longer than usual today

1295
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,920
You guys did it, you just sent an all that awesome stuff

1296
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,920
And I am so looking forward to getting home to being with my girls

1297
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,920
It's been a long two weeks on the road

1298
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,920
We've been working really, really hard

1299
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,920
Haven't been sleeping a lot

1300
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,920
And just bust an ass

1301
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,920
Wow, this is a Hey Fire Apes

1302
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,920
Fire Apes

1303
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,920
That's kind of irritating at the end there

1304
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,920
It's Friday

1305
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:51,920
Well, it's always wonderful

1306
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,920
When I'm able to be a state side

1307
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,920
Of course we had our week of New York with the sales weasels

1308
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,920
And that was fun working on explaining what we do

1309
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,920
And helping people make money

1310
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,920
For all those wonderful work that you guys are doing

1311
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,920
And of course San Francisco, you know, just to be able to be in the midst of it all

1312
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,920
A lot more shit seems to get done

1313
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,920
Sometimes in like, wow, man, I wish I was in San Francisco

1314
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,920
It would make a lot of things easier

1315
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,920
But I guess there's a reason for everything

1316
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,920
And, you know, run and I are wealthy enough not to have to work anymore

1317
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,920
And we start this company because we really, really believe in what we're doing

1318
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,920
And just hope that you can somehow share along with me

1319
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,920
That, you know, it's weeks like this or

1320
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,920
When you take the red eye to catch a couple meetings

1321
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,920
It's really what it takes if you want to do something

1322
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,920
There are no shortcuts

1323
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,920
It doesn't matter how much money you have, you can't build

1324
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,920
You can purchase

1325
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,920
That way you are striving towards

1326
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,920
It's just not possible, you can't buy

1327
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,920
The success that we're looking for

1328
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,920
Which is trust me, not a financial reward

1329
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,920
It's something much more

1330
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,920
It's really about just all this stuff spin around

1331
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,920
And people enjoying it and having fun and sharing stuff

1332
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,920
And creating a new form of broadcasting

1333
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,920
Which I believe goes way beyond the feed

1334
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,920
It's an important part of it

1335
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,920
But it's also what we're telling people

1336
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,920
So much more powerful for someone to say

1337
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,920
Hey, go check out soccer girl

1338
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,920
Than to be recommended by an engineer or something

1339
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,920
Anyway, I digress a little bit

1340
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,920
If you want to achieve something, you've got to work really hard

1341
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,920
So I want you to know that even this rich white boy

1342
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,920
It's got to work his ass off

1343
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,920
Get done what he wants to get done

1344
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,920
Trick to it all

1345
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,920
It's just fucking enjoying the ride

1346
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,920
Yes, stick that in your thought and I'll get it for the wind

1347
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,920
Stick those day food by Friday

1348
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,920
And I'm spinal thought on the wind

1349
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,920
That's it

1350
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,920
I'm going home, can't wait to have sex as well

1351
