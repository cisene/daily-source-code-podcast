1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You're Adam, it's Tony, I'm Josie.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey, if you need a savant for loafing around, I'm your man.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I can sit around the couch for two days straight and not lift the muscle.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I can pee in a cup.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I can watch TV for days on end.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So if you need a savant for just loafing around, you can't get me to Tony, Josie.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm in the old neighborhood, look me up.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Enjoy the DSC, $5.93.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You're...

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There ain't no reason things in this way.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's how they always been in the needs in this day.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can't explain why we live this way.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We do it every day.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Breaches on the podium, speaking of saying,

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's proper, so on the sidewalk, big for chains.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Old ladies laugh, but from the fire escape, cursing my name.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I got a basket full of lemons in their arms, tastes the same.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We know in a pigeon with a broken leg.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You can spend your whole life working for something.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Just to have it taken away.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
People walk around, pushing back their desks.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We're in pay tax, like necklace, and bracelets.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Talking about nothing, I'm thinking about that.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Every little heart beat, every little brown.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
People walk a tight road on a razor's edge.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Carry in their hurt and hatred and weapons.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It could be a bomb on a bullet or a pen or a thought or a word or a sentence.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
They know we just think of this way.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's how they always been in the needs in this day.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't know why.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I say the things I say, but I say them anyway.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But love will come to set me free.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Love will come to set me free.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I do believe.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Love will come to set me free.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I know it will.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Love will come to set me free.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Prison walls still standing tall.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Some things never change at all.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Keep on building prisons going to fill them all.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Keep on building bombs going to drop them all.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Working your fingers better to the bone, breaking it back.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Make yourself yourself like alone.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's filled with cold, so the cadence flow.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The wind blows wild and I may move.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But politicians lie and I am not full.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You don't need no reason or three pieces to argue the truth.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The air on my skin and the world and the my toes.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Slavery stitch and the fabric on my clothes.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Chaos and commotion wherever I go.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Love I try to follow.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Love will come to set me free.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Love will come to set me free.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I do believe.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Love will come to set me free.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I know it will.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Love will come to set me free.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They know reason things are this way.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They always been in the instant of the state.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can't explain why we live this way.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We do it every day.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Brett Dennan.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Ain't no reason kicking off the daily source code episode number five hundred and ninety three coming to you from the curry manner.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
In the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Guilford now.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The reason I play that song, I'm quite proud of this.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Of course, it's from the pot safe music network.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Brett Dennan had his song Ain't no reason as the conclusion to the main first episode of house on Fox TV.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So that was last night.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
John Glasscock, learning me to this.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And, of course, I know a D.I. Don't watch house on what it's about.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I can't get it here, but it's cool no matter what.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey, have a body.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let me tell you it's a another beautiful day.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I mean really, really stunning weather up there in the 20 degrees.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,160
centigrade once again, the wind is kind of what it was yesterday, although not really

81
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,800
gusting to any high high degree. So about 15 knots, so 17, 18 miles per hour, give or take.

82
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,120
Why do I mention all this? Well, of course, because I did it again. I'm so proud of myself.

83
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,720
I went flying this morning. So drop Christina off and continue right on to to the airfield

84
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,680
ferrocs. And, uh, oh, man, it's, uh, I'm, I'm like, I'm, it's so, uh, invigorating. I'm completely

85
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,920
tripping because I've, yeah, of course, I've flown solo and it's no problem. And I know how to do it,

86
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,680
but still, now I'm really starting to feel comfortable. And this is after, I don't know, I have,

87
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,320
if I count it up on my hours. I'm sure I'm somewhere between 1500 and 2000 hours of, of

88
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,720
flying time total, but in all different countries and different airfields and different rules. And of

89
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,360
course, I started with helicopters. So fixed wing, much less experience, but, uh, yeah, it's, uh,

90
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,000
getting exciting. Of course, I came back after the flight only to find out that, uh, the pipe

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,280
is down. We've got no more pipe. I guess. I don't know, uh, it's, you know, I, I'm not using, uh,

92
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,280
BT internet, but of course, uh, I am using the, you know, you have to have the BT landline in order

93
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,080
to get DSL service. And, uh, it's pretty interesting because I actually got a message from BT when

94
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,480
trying to connect and it says that the master circuit to my ISP is down or something like that.

95
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,520
But it's still kind of cool that then the modem connects to something else and then gives you that message.

96
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,520
Oh, quite impressed with that. Um, but right now, on the, uh, on the vote of phone, uh, USB

97
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,800
dongle thingy, which still gives me about to, it gets up to close to two, uh, a megabit per second,

98
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,200
uh, every now and then. So it's, uh, doable. I was able to download songs from, uh,

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,920
pots of music now, working somehow, uh, able to upload this entire show. Of course, back to the

100
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,800
flying, uh, let me just tell you what I did. Um, instead of, you know, touching ghost flying around the

101
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,640
airport, I went down south. I went to midhurst past Goodwood, which is a famous chichister, uh,

102
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,160
Goodwood airfield. They have a horse racing there, as well as car racing and a, a wonderful airfield.

103
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:14,360
I didn't land. I passed by went out, uh, coasted out over the ocean, uh, essentially turned, uh,

104
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,000
well, turned right, but eastwards. And just followed the coast for a little bit, uh, went past

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,400
shore, um, and then, uh, turned around and flew back up about an hours worth of flying, and it was just

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:30,440
really, it was so wonderful. Uh, uh, you know, and you get up to like 4,000 feet and when air was nice

107
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,840
and calm and I'm just like, whooping, you know, like, whoa, man, yeah, I was flying. I don't know

108
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,520
how to, uh, when they're morning, it's huge and fair, it's not at fair to the moment. We'll see

109
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,720
yesterday, uh, saw the aircraft out and thought, well, my one of Adam's showing up or they're just

110
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,880
putting it out into the sun because it, uh, it's been indoors for so long. Uh, anyway, um,

111
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:02,120
rub it in. Uh, what else are you gonna say? Uh, cover, okay, ceiling and visibility, okay, come on Adam,

112
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:09,080
you know, uh, ceiling and visibility, okay, otherwise in excess of, was it 10 kilometers horizontal

113
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:17,000
and no clouds? Um, yep. Sorry, I missed you. I'm usually there. So, um, drop by, have a coffee

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,840
and uh, see some of the, um, interesting toys I've got sometime. See you again sometime, bye.

115
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,600
You know, I don't usually go, uh, in on invitations from guys who want me to show you their,

116
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,840
me their interesting toys, Hugh. Uh, uh, I did have my holiday, I didn't see you anywhere. Yes,

117
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,960
they are today. I must say. And yes, thank you. Thank you. I know, I don't know what I was thinking.

118
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,440
Yes, today I talked about the weather report as they're reported for aviation and Kavoke as

119
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,400
it whenever you see Kavoke, that means we're going flying no matter what, uh, and yes, uh,

120
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,040
many people called in and, uh, and told me something of course I knew, but should have said

121
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:01,080
correct with the first time. Hello, Adam. It's a mic turning here from Bristol and the UK also known

122
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:14,760
as a German, the so-to-in that other world. Um, Kavoke, C-A-V-O-K, feeling and visibility, okay, that's what it's

123
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,400
done for because you didn't know that, right? You didn't know that at all with tailwinds and the Delta

124
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:27,160
Sierra. Also, I hope to see you on the annual opening pod show Ireland on the Saturday afternoon there.

125
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,280
That's Adam Newman. You have gone office and they asked the wrong man. I think you're on

126
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,320
you're actually a man yourself. You know you've been seeing the place and you've even got your

127
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,840
right office there. Take care, and we'll hope to see you on Saturday on the pod bus here at home.

128
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,880
I've gone in. Cheers, man. Cheers. Yeah, I really should go check out my office and see if I have

129
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,000
a mayor's chain to wear a key to the city. Yeah, maybe I'll pop by Saturday. Sunday, I'm going to go

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
pick up an action. I'm going to go to the show in the Netherlands. I hope I can talk about this

131
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,840
pretty soon. I'll see you because there's some cool shit happening around it. Excuse me. You know what

132
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:09,160
that means? It means this program is brought to you by Tyler and all p.m. I still haven't tried it

133
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,640
out myself, but I'm informed from very reliable sources. It really does work and Angie B will tell you

134
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,000
more about it on her show on wine on wine.podshow.com, which of course is sponsored by Tyler and all

135
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,560
p.m. I watched the Liverpool Chelsea last night. I'm not a, you know, I'm not a big sports fan,

136
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,400
not a big football fan. But when it comes to something like the Champions League, when it comes

137
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,320
to Liverpool playing basically a home game and these guys at the fans are very, very famous. Liverpool

138
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,720
is such an incredibly strong team. And of course we have Chelsea, which is a, uh, a lot of people

139
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,280
don't like Chelsea because, you know, we've got a foreign owner and, you know, it's like, hey,

140
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,960
you know, we don't really need a culture in our club. We'll just, you know, pull together all kinds

141
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,080
of foreigners to, which everyone kind of does. But I don't know, it just has a very negative

142
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,800
connotation in many cases. Now, please Chelsea fans don't get all upset that I'm saying this. I'm

143
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,680
just, you know, observing kind of from the outside. And it was a good game. Liverpool won. It was

144
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,920
interesting because, uh, multiple Dutch guys had to shoot penalty kicks. And if you know anything

145
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,800
about football and this much, I do know the Dutch when it comes to to sudden death. Oh, that was

146
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,320
the studio door. Sorry about that. When it comes to sudden death and, um, and penalty kicks,

147
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:30,600
the Holland socks. And so first there was, uh, Zenden, uh, he actually, he scored and he had a great

148
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,360
match, uh, all round. But then for Chelsea, they had, uh, Aryan Robin, he had these guys choke. The Dutch

149
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,760
always choke. And he choked. And then, of course, the winning penalty kick was made by, um,

150
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,520
caught another fine Dutchman. I'm telling you, these Dutch guys, they're taking care of business

151
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,840
over here. Now, really sad news though this morning. And they were talking about it at the airfield,

152
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,440
um, a businessman flying back from, uh, from the match, died when his helicopter crashed 10 miles

153
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:07,400
from his home. This is on an honorary vice president of Chelsea, Philip Carter himself and, uh,

154
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:14,680
two of his friends along with pilot Steven Holdich, um, perished. They're, uh, 10, a twin squirrel

155
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,960
helicopter. This is, I can't wait to find out what happened because this is very uncommon for a twin

156
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,000
engine helicopter to go down. Uh, and of course, the weather was fine, uh, last night as well.

157
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,600
Um, after the match, it should not have been a problem. Um, you see, where was it found? It was

158
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,000
found on its side virtually intact at Wandsford, near Peterborough. So they must have had a really

159
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:42,200
something weird must have gone down there. That's sad when that happens. So, uh, that was kind of the

160
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:49,880
bummer. Did read something on, uh, actually I saved this, um, from, uh, from Google reader. I think

161
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,200
I, where did I read this? Maybe, uh, maybe I read this, uh, while I was on vacation, but I went through

162
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,840
my start items, if you know how that works with all the Google products, it kind of works well.

163
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,800
No, this is from April 24th. Um, check this out. Cryptonite found in Serbian mine.

164
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,360
Min, when Minerologist Dr. Chris Stanley of London's Natural History Museum to

165
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,760
a web search on the chemical formula of a recently discovered unusual mineral he was shocked to find out

166
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,280
that the rock is Cryptonite. The mineral found in a Serbian mine by the company Rio Tinto consists of the

167
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,560
same count chemicals as fictional Cryptonite as described in the film Superman returns.

168
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,640
So, the BBC wrote about it. Uh, the new mineral does not contain fluorine, which it does in the

169
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,480
film, and is white rather than green, but in all other respects, the chemistry matches that rock

170
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:45,400
containing Cryptonite. I don't know what to think about this, but uh, if you're into geology,

171
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,320
if you know anything about minerals and stuff like that, and or if you're Superman, you know

172
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,120
about Cryptonite. I'd love to hear from you. The perfect Savand moment. We got another one for you today,

173
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,120
as well, um, which I think will you will enjoy almost a second, and just kind of new

174
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,040
voice mail message. Let me see what it is. Hey, Dad, um, it's me. I'm standing outside of the Odean,

175
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,440
you know, cinema, and I thought you were taking me out of the oven. Um, you probably have

176
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,240
a lot of water or something, so I'm going back and you're done, okay? She knows me so well,

177
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,000
you're probably on the line with Ron. Other interesting things coming into the voice mail today?

178
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,080
Hi, my name is Nick Reynolds, I'm Tom and I contact Adam Curry. I'm putting together a session

179
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,840
for this year's radio festival, and I want to do some of the interesting and participating.

180
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,280
It's about the impact of Pock Pock's blogs and everything else on radio.

181
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,800
Hmm. If he's interested, could he please give me a ring on this number? Oh, sir.

182
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,640
No, yeah, I won't give him the number. Well, I think that's uh,

183
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:52,040
man, man, man. Thank you. Good bye. I think that's the BBC. The impact of blogs,

184
00:14:52,040 --> 00:15:01,320
pods, and whatever on radio, hmmm. So many requests, so little things to do. Oh, man,

185
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,960
hold on a second. I can't believe I had something set up because it's been a while since

186
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,600
since I've heard from him hold on. Let me see, maybe if I'm lucky. Yeah, I think this will work.

187
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,760
Savorite with the nylon, spreading the news with the smile on where the roller rite.

188
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:29,080
Ringo polite. Let's listen, vote a while to the nylon. He's back, everybody, the nylon.

189
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,200
Hey Adam, Mr. nylon, um, to new format, interesting. I think every

190
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,560
product needs to evolve, so I commend you for evolving. However, I'm concerned, I don't want you

191
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:48,280
to become the Larry King of the podcast world. Larry King, everybody. It's not like the little

192
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,400
edge ahead. I kind of like the fine cell nature of the old cool mat, which is your show is about

193
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,680
nothing and anything on any given day. So let's not sell the baby out with the bath water.

194
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,560
This will example. Yeah, you haven't said, um, talk to you to a guest and probably about a month.

195
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:09,640
Oh, oh, allow me. Fuck you. By the way, nylon, please. I want to talk to you. I have

196
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,600
questions about the world bank. You are a true savant. You must give me a number to call.

197
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:21,160
It would be great if we could do that tonight. Please, you're perfect. You hate me and you and you

198
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:28,120
have knowledge. So let's get on with it. What's happening here? Kind of gentler side of you. So yeah,

199
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,520
I love that. That's the story of the savant thing every now and then, you know, the Larry King thing.

200
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,800
But, you know, keep the fine-filled and you know, lose your temper a bit. A little bit too

201
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,960
mellow for me. I think you're such a little peaman. You're taking it.

202
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:48,760
That's it. I'm not alone. No, no, I love you, man. Yeah, it's a Tylenol PM I'm taking. It keeps

203
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,400
me nice and mellow. Nice to see, though, that a lot of UK folks call it in. So we

204
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,000
mind as well. Make sure the US people know there's a phone number for you to call as well.

205
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,720
Where are you? I called you 20 minutes ago and you never called me back. You told me I

206
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,960
did that you were going to pick me up at 11 and if I know you're going to play, I would have made

207
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,360
other plans. This is like the third time recently that you promised to do something for me, Dad.

208
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,480
I'm completely flaked out on me. I understand you have to work in your busy, but I'm your daughter.

209
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,280
When you promise me something, something that's simpler, coming to pick me up, when you say you're

210
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,000
going to pick me up, then you do it. I'm so not fucking standing here in the middle of the night,

211
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,600
on the sidewalk, like some crazy homeless person. I'm really getting sick of this shit, Dad.

212
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,080
You keep making all these promises that I can't tell you more than you are the weed topic.

213
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,600
You're trying to run a little stone or pot head. And now I'm going to have to fucking take

214
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,880
a taxi all my home. And when I get there, you and I didn't have a little talk about responsibility.

215
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,800
And when I told you better be standing out the day, there's enough money to pay for this cab.

216
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:12,680
You fucking better be wearing men's clothing. She's little actress, isn't she?

217
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,720
Take that out of all the wood. Hello. I'm Chris Layton. And I'm Nick Cooper. And hang on, hang on.

218
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,760
Is this thing even on? Hello. Hello. Mr. Curry. Mr. Curry, can you hear us?

219
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,080
Oh, God, it's just going to turn into a method technical blunders and a series of cock-ups, isn't it?

220
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,320
Not necessarily. We're professionals.

221
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,720
Fessional to my ass. Mr. Curry. Can you hear us, Mr. Curry?

222
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,600
You know, I just give up before you. Who is this, Mr. Curry anyway?

223
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Who's Mr. Curry? Who's Mr. Curry? Mr. Curry?

224
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,320
Mr. Curry only happens to be the bad father.

225
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,320
Oh, I understand now. You do?

226
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,080
Yeah, it's a pseudonym for Dave Terrell.

227
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:53,080
No, not Dave Terrell. Adam Curry, the poor father. God, you know, the big boss.

228
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,080
Oh, him, that guy who picked us off of a use station and gave us this nice,

229
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,680
cushy mammoth task. I'm presenting the disaster that is the pod zone.

230
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,440
Don't say that. Everything's fine here, Mr. Curry. Just ignore Nick.

231
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,680
The pod zone is a marvelous thing. Almost. Thank you, Bill English. Join you.

232
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,240
And the other fantastic talent on BT Pod Show.

233
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,200
Suck up. Anyway, to the point, Mr. Curry, we would just like to say a few words.

234
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,560
If that's all right with you. Bloody well, should be.

235
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:25,560
We just like to invite all DSC listeners to check out the pod zone's podcast at podzone.btpodshow.com.

236
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,120
Yeah, it's really good. We host a great show with the best pod save music on the planet.

237
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,800
And all the great features that your listeners haven't learned to know and put up with.

238
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,400
Such as the Crucial 3, Tech News, the misconceptions for his own thingy,

239
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,120
and Nick's STDs. So that's the pod zone. Podzone.btpodshow.com.

240
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,400
Thanks again, Mr. Curry.

241
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,720
Mr. Curry, I remember now the guy who likes naked pictures of podpasses.

242
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,040
Hey, seems to curry would fancy one of mine.

243
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:56,520
Oh, um, I'm not too sure. Either way, Mr. Curry, we love you.

244
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,760
Oh, and I'm one more thing with grunches.

245
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah, you think I didn't know that?

246
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,680
That's why you guys are on the network. We needed to balance it out a little bit.

247
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,960
We needed some more scrunchers.

248
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,880
Well, seriously, it's welcome. Good to have you guys aboard.

249
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,800
Hey, let me see.

250
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Coming up in just minutes. Another savant from who joins us in the circle of the

251
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,720
Cirque de Stavant. Oh, there you go. There's anyone.

252
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,160
Let's seek this savant or de Stavant.

253
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,080
Seek de Savant. Yeah. Yeah, that kind of works, doesn't it?

254
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,320
Like Cirque de Sly, only different.

255
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,760
Once in a while, people will call in and when they've had a brush with greatness.

256
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,600
And today is no exception.

257
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,080
Hey, Adam, our green sea from New York, and I'm out here in San Francisco tonight.

258
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,160
Went off to a blogger dinner with Scoville and you and some other people.

259
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,800
You never guessed who I met. I found one of the famous savants.

260
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,560
Say hello. If you did put it for them, then you can't find it.

261
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,600
That's a real surprise.

262
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,200
Wait a minute.

263
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,440
I love it prolific program when he gets flustered, man. You can't understand him.

264
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,640
Here you go. Listen, it's him. It's him.

265
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,640
Wait, wait, wait. I don't understand.

266
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand.

267
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
What are you saying, man?

268
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Savant. Say hello.

269
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,640
If you did put it for them, then you can't understand.

270
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,640
If you did put it for them, then you can't understand.

271
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
I met the prolific programer.

272
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,640
I'm excited. Man, it was great. The intro grammar was here. It was a whole thing.

273
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,640
So, sorry can be here, man. You're up in London, junior thing.

274
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,640
But we'll catch up with you soon. Cheers.

275
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Yeah, buddy. Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

276
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,640
I'm just waiting for the right moment to get the superior savant prolific programer on the show.

277
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,640
Because I know he's got a lot of good stuff to say. I just don't have a reason yet.

278
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,640
But when I'm ready, I know that he'll be there and he'll be ready for me.

279
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
The savant specials.

280
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Okay, it's time for our savant from our series of the circle of savants.

281
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Buying the salt and the salt savants.

282
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,640
So long.

283
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,640
I think I'm going to be able to get at least once a month in episode.

284
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,640
There's a fast forward button on there for a reason.

285
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,640
And I hope to be able to talk to savant every single day.

286
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
So long.

287
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,640
And by the way, I want you to know that this format change.

288
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,640
Doesn't mean that I don't want to make it pictures, make it pictures.

289
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,640
I'm the salt and the sense of on savants.

290
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Joining us now is a guy who I've had some email contact with over the past several weeks.

291
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,640
I think we probably had contact a long time ago as well.

292
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,640
I don't know. My brain is so fried.

293
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,640
And he sent me feedback. He sent me voice mail.

294
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,640
And honestly, you know, the stuff that he sent me has been so long.

295
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
I'm like, I just didn't know where to put it.

296
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,640
So I did finally get around to playing one of his, one of his pieces of feedback recently.

297
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,640
And he joins us now as our official nuk savant.

298
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,640
His savant name is a atomic rod.

299
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Rod Adams, welcome to the Daily Source Code.

300
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
Hello, I don't know how are you.

301
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
I'm good, man.

302
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Well, now you are a home on a second.

303
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
I got this from your website.

304
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,640
An atomic entrepreneur.

305
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
It's right.

306
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,640
And you've been professing.

307
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
And this is what really interested me and want me to get in touch with you and talk about it.

308
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,640
The concept of a backyard nuclear reactor.

309
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
You bet.

310
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,640
And an actor safe enough to be surrounded by people.

311
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Okay, so the first of all, are you actually making anything?

312
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,640
Because I looked around your site and it seems like you've been interested in this for a long time.

313
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,640
Are you actually physically creating a reactor?

314
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Or are you just making a plans and following policy and politics, et cetera?

315
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
We have invented the metal yet.

316
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
We're doing a lot of design work.

317
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,640
And an awful lot of the background work and the foundational work.

318
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Necessary policy regulations that kind of stuff.

319
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,640
It takes a long time to get a permit to do what we want to do.

320
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Well, yeah.

321
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,640
When you're handling uranium and stuff like that.

322
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,640
Well, there's nothing wrong with uranium.

323
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Well, we're going to talk about uranium in a second.

324
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,640
But first my uranium.

325
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,640
Okay, so Rod, what you're talking about here is building a...

326
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,640
Or I guess the concept of every home having their own nuclear reactor.

327
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,640
And that being an alternative for fossil-based fuel and energy that we currently use.

328
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,640
Correct?

329
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
Well, we want to eventually get to homes.

330
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,640
But initially we're going to start more in the mini reactor as the micro reactor.

331
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:49,640
It's going to be more like large buildings and stopping malls and industrial parks and ships and that kind of stuff.

332
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Significantly smaller than the current reactors.

333
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,640
But not quite to the personal reactor mode.

334
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
Sort of like the computers.

335
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
You know, one from mainframes down to many computers.

336
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,640
And eventually we had Jonathan and his boys to invoke to then develop the micro computers.

337
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
But it took a while.

338
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,640
So on the atomic insights site that I guess is yours.

339
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
There's a couple of interesting things here.

340
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
And we kind of jails with what you just said.

341
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Atomic power is safe enough to float to power floating cities with more than 5,000 people living within 1,000 feet of the plant.

342
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,640
And that's what we call nuclear powered aircraft carriers.

343
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,640
It's clean enough to operate inside sealed submarines.

344
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
True, they're nuclear submarines.

345
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,640
Cheap enough to provide overnight power for about 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour.

346
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,640
I have no idea it sounds like a real bargain.

347
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,640
And compared it enough to make suppliers of all other energy sources very nervous.

348
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Okay, let's start with that one first.

349
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,640
You know, nuclear power, you still need to mind stuff.

350
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,640
You still need the equivalent of a refinery, which is just like the oil business, I guess.

351
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
Why would they be very nervous about it?

352
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Well, it's the matter of scale.

353
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:10,640
A pound of uranium has as much energy as 2 million pounds of oil.

354
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,640
But that in perspective, you can hold the pound of uranium in the palm of your hand.

355
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,640
It's about the size of three hundred marbles.

356
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Two million pounds of oil requires 30 tanker trucks to carry it.

357
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
Okay.

358
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:35,640
So, but it'll end the pound of uranium right now, even after a seven years worth of price run out, cost about $100.

359
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,640
And really, that's all about after all the refining and the enriching that you go through it,

360
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,640
it's surely the value must be much higher after that process.

361
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,640
Well, even after all of the refining and rich and commercial nuclear fuel costs about 1.20,

362
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,640
as much as oil does on a per unit heat basis.

363
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,640
So, you can get that 1.5 cents right now.

364
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,640
If you produce electricity with oil, it'll cost you over 8 cents to get it all out.

365
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
Okay.

366
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Now, Rod, you're talking, I've got to bring it back to some really understandable concepts.

367
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
Okay.

368
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,640
First of all, you talk about uranium.

369
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,640
I mean, this is the yellow cake that Iraq supposedly had,

370
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:30,640
and all the technology that people or other kind of evil acts as evil countries are supposedly developing and using.

371
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:37,640
And here you are talking about uranium, like you could go down to the drugstore and grab a couple marbles worth a minute.

372
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:45,640
Is this, is this incredibly hard to produce, then, or enrich to make viable for nuclear energy?

373
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Well, actually, you don't have to enrich it.

374
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,640
There are reactors operating today in Canada that use natural uranium as their fuel source.

375
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,640
It doesn't require enrichment, if you design a reactor problem.

376
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:08,640
Now, if you enrich it, it does make it a little better, it's sort of like the difference between running crude oil in your car and running gasoline in your car.

377
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,640
Gasoline burns a lot better than crude oil does, so you do some refining to it.

378
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,640
That's what we enrich your engine, just to make it work a little better and smaller reactor.

379
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Okay, and build a reactor with natural uranium.

380
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,640
And this uranium, it's a natural element that comes out of the earth.

381
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,640
I mean, is this just an endless supply?

382
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,640
Is it only found in certain locations?

383
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,640
I'm really trying to figure out how viable this is as an alternative to other energy sources.

384
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Where do we get the uranium from?

385
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,640
Is it in my backyard already?

386
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,640
Cause I made some of your backyard.

387
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
I wanted to be my neighbor's backyard.

388
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
I don't want uranium in my backyard.

389
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Well, it's pretty common.

390
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,640
It's pretty widely distributed to the earth.

391
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,640
It's about as common as 10.

392
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,640
There are some places in the world that have very nice supplies of uranium.

393
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:04,640
Particularly the major sources of uranium in the world are Australia, which has about a third of the world's known supplies.

394
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,640
And Canada, which has about 25% of the world's known supplies.

395
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
The US has a lot.

396
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:18,640
And there's deposits in Kazakhstan and a bunch of other places that are very economical to mind.

397
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,640
But worldwide, there's really no limit to where you can mind uranium.

398
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
It's pretty widely distributed.

399
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,640
Right, but that's what we thought about oil initially as well.

400
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
It can run out, I presume.

401
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Well, we've been looking seriously for oil and using a lot of it for 150 years.

402
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,640
Now, uranium is far more energy dense.

403
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,640
Like I said, one pound of uranium is worth 2,000,000 pounds of oil.

404
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Right.

405
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
It's widely distributed.

406
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,640
And we've only really used it for a very short period of time.

407
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,640
You know, we haven't used it for energy until that 1957 was the first commercial power plant.

408
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,640
And not only that, we found as much as we needed in about the first 10 years of looking

409
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,640
and really haven't looked much in the last 30 years.

410
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,640
And the reason to stop looking was the price got so low that it was economical to develop it.

411
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,640
Look at, abandoned mines in the US that are still full of uranium.

412
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,640
We just stopped producing it because the price was too low.

413
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
Okay.

414
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,640
So, and that, by the way, can also be a significant problem.

415
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
Because someone's less to go in and mind this stuff.

416
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Right.

417
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,640
The price is now almost 10 times, but it was 7 years ago.

418
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,640
So it's back to an economical mineral demand.

419
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Okay.

420
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,640
So how much will a backyard nuke reactor cost me to power my home?

421
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,640
Just, you know, taking into account that we are down the line somewhere.

422
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,640
We've gone past the main frame where the PC version of the nuclear reactor.

423
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
What's it going to cost me, Rod?

424
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,640
That's how I get to the PC version.

425
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,640
We'll probably be looking at $50,000 to power your home.

426
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,640
But that'll last you for about 30 years without any new fuel.

427
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
That's pretty cool.

428
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,640
Yeah.

429
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,640
But it was at all depends on a bigger house.

430
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Your house may be more developed.

431
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
Yeah.

432
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
But still, 50,000.

433
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,640
And after 30 years, you can fill her back up.

434
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,640
I mean, do you have to get rid of the whole reactor?

435
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
I mean, what's the idea here?

436
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,640
And of course, the obvious questions.

437
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,640
What do we do with the waste and how about the dangers?

438
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
Yeah.

439
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,640
Well, the waste is very small.

440
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,640
I used to be an engineer on the submarine.

441
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
And I'm way back in a previous life.

442
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
On a nuclear submarine, might I chance?

443
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Oh, yeah.

444
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
We'll see on account we have a new way.

445
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
We don't really.

446
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,640
We don't have like old fashioned coal submarines or beans or something like that.

447
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,640
I mean, you don't have steam engine submarines.

448
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
Well, we do have steam engines submarines.

449
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,640
But they are heated with nuclear energy.

450
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Okay.

451
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
Right.

452
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
I'm sorry.

453
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
We got rid of our last diesel sub probably can.

454
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,640
Well, actually, we had one diesel sub that we just beat commission,

455
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,640
but it was a very specialized deep diving submarine.

456
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,640
But other than that, let me just tell you what's the sub in the Navy in 10 years.

457
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
That's going to tell you, man.

458
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
There's two things I love.

459
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
I love flying and I love submarines.

460
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
I cannot tell you.

461
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,640
I am so enchanted by, you know, run silent, run deep.

462
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Ice station zebra.

463
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,640
I've seen all the movies with all the submarines.

464
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
I love that shit.

465
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,640
Yeah.

466
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Me too.

467
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
It was fun.

468
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
All right.

469
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,640
So now to the waste.

470
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
Okay.

471
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
So arguably, there's very little waste.

472
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Okay.

473
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
So just to give you an idea of how little waste,

474
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
the reactor on board my submarine.

475
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,640
If you took all the.

476
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,640
If you just looked at the fuel and you put it in a nice container,

477
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,640
it'd be a container, maybe.

478
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Oh, five feet in diameter and 10 feet high.

479
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,640
And that lasted 15 years.

480
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,640
Now we're a 9,000.

481
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Some of them are okay.

482
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
But if that.

483
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
If that stuff ever gets out of its container,

484
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
it could potentially contaminate surrounding.

485
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640
What do you think it is green?

486
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Who's or something?

487
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
I don't know.

488
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
What is it?

489
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,640
It's solid.

490
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,640
Ceramic.

491
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

492
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
I told you, bro, you don't get my face, man.

493
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
I'm not like an anti-nube guy.

494
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
I'm just trying to figure it out.

495
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
No, it's.

496
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
It.

497
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,640
It's a material that they can't leak because it's.

498
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,640
It's solid.

499
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
It.

500
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
It's like.

501
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Very.

502
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Uh.

503
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
Pretty shiny metal.

504
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
It was sitting in a.

505
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
In a.

506
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
Battle of hot water for a long time.

507
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,640
It's just that.

508
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
That's a hot water.

509
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
And you put it in a nice.

510
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Really infilled container.

511
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
And it's.

512
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
It's.

513
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,640
Doesn't.

514
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
It's.

515
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
It's.

516
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
I did not know that.

517
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,640
I mean, people totally.

518
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,640
I mean, yeah, you think about waste.

519
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:49,640
You know, if what we see in your mind, of course, is these, you know, excess oil drums that

520
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,640
have big, you know, atomic energy warning signs all over it and radiation signs.

521
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,640
And of course, you're thinking it's green ooze that comes out.

522
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,640
I mean, that's that's totally what I think.

523
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,640
Sure.

524
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,640
Well, you told me that.

525
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
I would.

526
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Oh, well, okay, conspiracy.

527
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,640
You know, just put my tin foil back.

528
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
No, I'm not.

529
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
I'm not.

530
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
I'm not.

531
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
I'm not.

532
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,640
Three.

533
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Like the portrait, or the compositions.

534
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,640
Certainly.

535
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
Okay, and this.

536
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,640
We can get into that.

537
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,640
But, you, I'm already learning some amazing things here.

538
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,640
So it's.

539
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
In theory.

540
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,640
And the theory is that whatever, in cases the shiny beautiful object that is known as

541
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,640
Luke, it ne下 a waste in theory.

542
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,640
Um, that can be safe guarded in perpetuity.

543
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
Sure.

544
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
Okay.

545
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
Now, sorry.

546
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,640
Put it in the container.

547
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,180
and you can watch it.

548
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,800
And some people want to somehow

549
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,960
postulate a society where nobody will be around

550
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
to watch it anymore.

551
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,080
And then, of course, I don't understand quite how they

552
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,560
expect somebody to be hurt if nobody's around to watch it.

553
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,040
But that's beyond, I don't understand how people are going

554
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,680
to be hurt.

555
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,720
No one in the world has ever been hurt by exposure

556
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,840
to the used nuclear fuel.

557
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,160
OK, gotcha, now we can move into the final frontier

558
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,920
of questioning when it comes to nuclear energy.

559
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,200
We've all, we all know the history of Chernobyl.

560
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
We know three mile island.

561
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,960
What are the risks involved in meltdown?

562
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,680
Or, and of course, this is something of the most,

563
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,200
the past seven years, what if there's a terrorist attack

564
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,200
on a nuclear reactor?

565
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,680
What are the dangers?

566
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,280
Not to, that's a complicated question.

567
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,720
Let me see if I can give you a simple answer

568
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,520
from my point of view.

569
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,240
The technology that we want to develop

570
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,960
is called the space dumps on a called a pebble bed reactor.

571
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,920
And it uses a fuel that was developed,

572
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,160
not in the first generation of nuclear plants.

573
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,120
It was developed after a lot of thought

574
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,960
and consideration.

575
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,040
And basically, it is a fuel that cannot melt.

576
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,960
And it's surrounded by materials that are very high

577
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,560
in the country, the capacity of materials.

578
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:15,560
And those pebble bed reactors can operate

579
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,080
in a situation where no matter what happens

580
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,520
to the cooling system, the reactor cannot get hot enough

581
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,960
to melt.

582
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,280
And we like that design a lot

583
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,960
because it makes it easy to design

584
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,920
very safe reactors.

585
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,120
So in other words, the reactor that cannot have a meltdown.

586
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,200
Correct.

587
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Especially when it's designed to be a fairly small reactor.

588
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,200
And you can build a pretty good size pebble bed reactor

589
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,240
and still prove that it can withstand any postulated

590
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,160
accident and not melt.

591
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,340
There's a video on the web that

592
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,320
Chinese have one of these operatives pebble bed reactors.

593
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,920
And they actually do the test instead of just doing

594
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,760
the equations and saying it won't melt.

595
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,920
They actually say, OK, watch.

596
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,280
And they turn off all the cooling and watch what it does

597
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:12,280
and it was a Australian Broadcasting Channel, ABC,

598
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,840
to paddle this program.

599
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,840
I think it was called.

600
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,640
Damn those Chinese.

601
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,000
Well, actually they copy it out the Germans.

602
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,240
The German pebble bed reactor was developed in Germany.

603
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,240
Called the ABR.

604
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,560
And they built the ABR operative for about 25 years.

605
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,640
They also built a follow-on called the Thorium

606
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,040
Hyperion after THTR.

607
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,560
And so that was also done.

608
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,640
And by the way, you got to say damn those Americans

609
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,640
because it was an American named Ferington Daniels,

610
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,760
who actually developed the idea that they peed 47.

611
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,880
But he didn't have the materials that now is necessary

612
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
to make it work.

613
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,680
All right, Rod.

614
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,880
So, so, anyway.

615
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,200
So, it's a South African's work on it too.

616
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,640
So, and if there was an explosion, because I'm just going

617
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,760
based on the fears that it's embedded in people's minds,

618
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,400
if there was some form of explosion unrelated to the core,

619
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,200
but can radiation be released into the atmosphere?

620
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,640
Can we get a Chernobyl repeat or these pebble,

621
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,880
be tree actors?

622
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Are they safe guard against that as well?

623
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,040
It is safe guardians.

624
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,400
Well, they're actually in a full containment.

625
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,920
At least I want to build a full prototype containment.

626
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,320
It's a pretty significant vault with lots of steel

627
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,120
on concrete.

628
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:36,720
I just can't see it failing and releasing any radio activity

629
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,040
to the environment.

630
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,160
So, Rod, we're going to work to actually build some

631
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,200
that we can prove that to people by actual person.

632
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,120
So, it appears to me that the only hurdle

633
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,080
would you have two hurdles, and maybe I could help you.

634
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,440
I don't know. I'm interested.

635
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,680
I think you got a very compelling story.

636
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,720
And of course, I need to read up and get some background

637
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,240
on this, but the first one would be the PR.

638
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,000
The whole PR aspect, and this goes into politics,

639
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,680
there's just a horrible, horrible meme of nuclear energy.

640
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,040
Everyone's going to be glowing in the dark.

641
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,680
We're going to kill our babies of the future with the waste.

642
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,120
Is there anyone who is trying to work on that problem,

643
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,080
which I think would be almost insurmountable?

644
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,360
Well, actually there are a lot of people,

645
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,120
but a couple of very prominent people.

646
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,760
There's a guy named Patrick Moore who was a Greenpeace founder

647
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,400
and has come to the clean side and then become a pro nuclear activist.

648
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,240
He's been talking around all around the U.S.

649
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,040
The woman named Christine Pat Wooden, Todd Whitman.

650
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,760
And after who's Jersey a director?

651
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,320
She was from New Jersey, didn't she get kicked out of office in New Jersey?

652
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,120
Well, I don't know about that, but yeah, a administrator.

653
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,480
No, she had some kind of, she was a sex scandal.

654
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,680
She had a sex scandal or something like that.

655
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,120
Oh, maybe that was just a fantasy.

656
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,720
That was another New Jersey.

657
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,120
That's right.

658
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,640
No, it was just my fantasy.

659
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,120
I was fantasy people.

660
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,000
First he taught Whitman.

661
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,120
I was like, yeah, baby.

662
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,480
I know what I do to you.

663
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
Right.

664
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,160
The other thing, obviously, is money.

665
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,600
I mean, if you were to get into business,

666
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,800
how much money would it take to get a functioning,

667
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,160
mall powering, completely terrorist proof, shiny, waste,

668
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,800
pooping reactor together based on pebbles?

669
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,920
The first one will probably cost us about 300 grand.

670
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,840
$300 million, sorry, $300 million for the first one.

671
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:41,160
But that's a lot of it's the initial cost of any new machine.

672
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,160
We believe that we're going to be able to build 10

673
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,760
major lot units for on the order of $20 million of fees.

674
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,480
See, that kind of money doesn't scare me,

675
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,720
because I know it's out there.

676
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,400
And well, it doesn't scare me any energy business.

677
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,640
It's an expensive business.

678
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,000
So do you have plans?

679
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,080
Do you have, like, what do you have, like,

680
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,840
blueprints?

681
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,680
Do you sit over that at night with your nuclear buddies?

682
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,080
And you draw this up?

683
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,840
Or are you, do you have engineers?

684
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,720
I mean, how far are you with this project?

685
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Well, right now we've got some engineers working.

686
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,040
Mostly at night on their own computers,

687
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,160
but the good thing about today is we have computers

688
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,680
for a more powerful order that some

689
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,040
were used to design an odd list.

690
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,440
And we have a bunch of business planners,

691
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,640
a couple of MBAs from Duke and an entrepreneur

692
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,640
who's been in business for a number of years

693
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,120
and some good advisors and we've got a pretty solid business

694
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
plan going on.

695
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,680
All right, man, listen, atomic rods.

696
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,720
That's serious stuff.

697
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,400
Here's what you do.

698
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,040
You get your MBA boys together.

699
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,440
You get them to put together the presentation

700
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,320
or some kind of something that I can send off to someone

701
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,880
like Bill Joy or John Doer or Ray Lane.

702
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,280
I'll send it to a man.

703
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,720
And they'll take a look at it and these are those kind of,

704
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,880
you know, these are the guys who can make that kind of money

705
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,080
happen.

706
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,520
Yep, well, it's a public promise, man.

707
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,080
It's a what?

708
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,280
I said, I think you just made a public promise.

709
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,680
We've got that stuff almost ready to go now.

710
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,160
Or with it about two days.

711
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
Yeah, yeah.

712
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,080
Of course, you're right, listen to this show.

713
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,920
It'll be all over me.

714
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,120
It's like, hey, man, fuck, why do you mention on the show

715
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,920
or because we want to get in first?

716
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,280
We went, I went and talked to some Google engineers

717
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,360
about two weeks ago at Google headquarters

718
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,000
and talked about this.

719
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,600
And we've been doing a lot of talking.

720
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,520
But there's a lot going on besides talking.

721
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,040
Right on, oops, hold on, that's my, yeah.

722
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,880
No problem.

723
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,040
Hold on one second, I think that's my wife, don't go away.

724
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,080
All right, that's what we call a natural edit.

725
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,600
Yeah, I have to break my wife.

726
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,280
You know, she calling me 11.30 at night.

727
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,800
She's calling to bed.

728
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,240
She's oversees him to Holland this week.

729
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,320
She'll do it her start, Dan, who was the star?

730
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,360
Yeah, man, she's like, I can't, I shouldn't be talking about it.

731
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,320
But she's got an amazing, I'm going to go over it

732
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,160
because I'm also partially, I'm not going to actually be on the show,

733
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,960
but a whole bunch of friends of mine are on the show.

734
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,400
And it's going to be pretty cool.

735
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,280
So she's rehearsing and doing press.

736
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,440
And I don't know, she's having a good time.

737
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,640
And leaving it very proud has been, oh, absolutely.

738
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,160
It's just, I got to get help, man.

739
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,640
I need like a full-time person because I got to take care

740
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,640
of the kid.

741
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,640
I got it to you.

742
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,640
I got the animals.

743
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
Of course, the cats.

744
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
It's 11.30.

745
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
They're still outside running around.

746
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
I don't know where they are.

747
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,640
They don't want to come in.

748
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
You know, I'm doing everything wrong.

749
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,640
You know, it's typical Mr. Mom shit.

750
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,640
All right, dude.

751
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,640
For those days.

752
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,640
Yeah, my baby is graduating from college.

753
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,640
So it's not been too long ago.

754
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
I don't remember those days.

755
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,640
All right.

756
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,640
Well, now I feel old.

757
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
Thank you.

758
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
Atomic Rod, we're going to check in with you from time to time.

759
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
Have your MBA boys and that stuff over.

760
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,640
And if you've got any nuclear news, just give me a shout.

761
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
You got it.

762
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,640
What's my every move?

763
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,640
And sticking out on notice?

764
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
Do you want to be?

765
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,640
Everything that I want to be?

766
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,640
But for all the wrong reasons.

767
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,640
You'll never see.

768
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,640
Without a creative point in your body.

769
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,640
You're forced to imitate.

770
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,640
You try to walk online.

771
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,640
They find out your fate.

772
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,640
Counting out the wig of it.

773
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,640
That's the day I know.

774
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,640
You're right.

775
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,640
You're the world.

776
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,640
You're right.

777
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,640
You're right.

778
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,640
You're the world.

779
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,640
You're the world.

780
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,640
You're the world.

781
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,640
You're the world.

782
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,640
You're the world.

783
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,640
You're the world.

784
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,640
You're the world.

785
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,640
You're the world.

786
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:26,640
You're the new hurrayer of art.

787
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,840
And then you're cast out to see

788
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:35,140
Finding yourself all alone with the most powerful force in the world

789
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,640
Instead of the blue and slowly drift away

790
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:45,140
Counting all our wind coming

791
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,140
That's it everybody

792
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,780
I'm different, I'm different

793
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:59,240
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done

794
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,740
I'm done, I'm done end my heart

795
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:08,640
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done

796
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:50,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

797
00:46:50,140 --> 00:47:20,140
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

798
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:27,480
I learned that there are now reactors that cannot experience meltdown, hmm, getting pretty

799
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,480
interesting.

800
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,200
Alright tomorrow we'll probably have another sabondon if I can schedule some of them and

801
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,160
get someone willing to come on and talk about some ship and Friday of course, the maximum

802
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:42,100
