00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I present Padshal's poet laureate Melvin P. LeBeth.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Roses are ready. My sweater is beige. For your domain name needs, you should go to this page. GoDaddy.com.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes, so we seem to be having a problem with Flight 576. The captain is a bit liberated. Yes, he's smashed.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, no, so the only backups we have for this flight are Johnson, and of course, Johnson has been sleeping, and I do believe he's a bit high right now.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And of course, Henry has not had any longer flights than London to Paris.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But I do see on the artillery that we have an atom carry who would be flying. I do understand that he is a pilot, but perhaps he could take the copilot seat and help us get off the ground.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, right, so he's probably high too. There, we'll get Henry up here and we'll see if he can take Virgin Atlantic across the Atlantic.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
On his virgin flight, how ironic. And the DSC 576 will go on.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you remember?

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Way back last summer, when mainstream radio was such a fucking monomer, no ending music, nothing to funny.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Cleared channel with a fuckers, didn't bother money, but supply didn't hurt at all.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now you can have it all. I heard it on the podcast, rocking fucking radio, you wanted it.

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Got it, just downloaded a part it on the podcast. No one's gonna stop you telling FCC to stick it pickin' the revisions on.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you remember? Your first computer, that piece of shit was like a freaking rotor.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Now we've got Wi-Fi, downloading files fast, listening to everyone who's ever done on my cast.

16
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's his duty, now you see each and every nation. The radio is got to go inside our imagination.

17
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
May that song sing along, mash it up and mix it, breathe fucking loads of out-and-goer and fix it.

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're so loud, it heard the call. Now you can have it all.

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You'll be making a real sign.

20
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I heard it on the podcast, rocking fucking radio, you wanted it.

21
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Got it, just downloaded a part it on the podcast. No one's gonna stop you telling FCC to stick it pickin' the revisions on a podcast.

22
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I heard it on the podcast, rocking fucking radio, you wanted it. Got it, just downloaded a part it on the podcast.

23
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No one's gonna stop you telling FCC to stick it pickin' the revisions on.

24
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you remember? Your second computer, that piece of shit was like a fucking rotor.

25
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Pickin' up, Delta Sheriff Charlie, five, seven, six from the Curry Condor and Northern California.

26
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I heard it on a podcast.

27
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, I love public toilets. So where's the toilet paper?

28
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Wait a sec, there's not only the paper here.

29
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What am I gonna do now? Oh, got it, I've got my eye, but with me, so I think DSC 5, 76 will do that.

30
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So let's try it, it feels good.

31
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Are you wiping your ass with your eye? I wasn't gonna make it without your DSC.

32
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But everybody, how you doing? It is the Daily Source Code.

33
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Completely full-barred and very, very late for me. A couple of reasons.

34
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
First, a really good reason. And by the way, really late means a 10-to-1 AM.

35
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Of course, it is the fourth of April.

36
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Coming up on the Lady Patricia's birthday, everybody. That's Saturday, the seventh of April.

37
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay, first a good reason. I had a very awesome day tonight with Natalie Del Conti.

38
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
A known from the Hit Potcho Video Program, Textra, which you can find at textra.potcho.com.

39
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That was nice. Oh, man. It was perfect to end a wacky day opening game for the San Francisco Giants,

40
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
who completely got clobbered by the pod rays. I think it was like a 7-0 shot out.

41
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So the city was mad. Everyone was just out of their mind.

42
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It was not pretty. Particularly where Potcho HQ was located, which is a right near 21st Amendment,

43
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
a very well-known bar, not far from the stadium.

44
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, boy, boy. That was a nasty mess.

45
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Anyway, went to meet Natalie up at, I think, what's the name of the restaurant?

46
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Treso, I think. Somewhere near her house. I forget where it is.

47
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
In a very nice neighborhood of San Francisco, then I'm in. That much I know for sure.

48
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So I had a nice meal and then walked up and down the street there and had some frozen yogurt.

49
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I mean, I was totally king of the dweaves. Everyone's like, I do.

50
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's Natalie. Look at that geek walking next to her.

51
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So got back to the condo, not too late, actually. I don't know around 930 something like that.

52
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And then, of course, started to do my prep for the show. I passed out.

53
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So tired. The jet lag just hit me. I literally passed out with a laptop burning a hole on my lap.

54
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And I don't know, wait, that was the split burning a hole in my lap.

55
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But the laptop was on too. That was very hot.

56
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And then I started the show and something, and I was a little confused about what the error.

57
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And I still don't know exactly what's going on.

58
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
For those of you who I'm sure noticed that yesterday's show came through without art, without any tags.

59
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The reason for that is when I went to save the show from cast blaster, you save the show first and then you uploaded to the PDN.

60
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It gave me some kind of weird error that it couldn't fight.

61
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's first it said, picture not saved, because I put this awesome new art in that the Ben from the Ben cast sent me.

62
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It said, picture not saved. And so you click. Oh, picture not saved because it was not found.

63
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then you click.

64
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay, you know, basically the big ignore the big ignore button that Windows gives you.

65
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And then it said, here's the frightening one. Access violation. Oh boy, I was violated.

66
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Something was violated. It was deep within the guts of cast blaster.

67
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And so it wouldn't save the file.

68
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It would save just the file name of zero bytes in length, which of course is frightening because I just recorded a whole show 40 minutes.

69
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Now, an undocumented feature I think of cast blasters that you can always get the whatever was recorded is written immediately to disk.

70
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So you can find a temp dot MP3 file in your cast blaster directory with the application lives.

71
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So that's how I was able to salvage the actual show so that I could upload it.

72
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
A couple of things this file didn't play on interestingly enough, particularly on the Nokia N800 internet tablet.

73
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't know what's up with that. That was the only error message I got from people was those who were using an N800.

74
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't know why it's single doubt that device for this particular problem.

75
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So I didn't really think too much of it. I talked to Andrew Grumman on the way in and said, you know, he's what's going on, you know, why isn't it playing on that device and I explained what happened.

76
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And as I loaded up the show, the first, of course, I do all my serious satellite radio stuff.

77
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And I went to save that and same damn thing. Access violation.

78
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's so scary when I get it. It's Microsoft or terrorists, man. That's frightening language.

79
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's that's really scary to see that in all these hexadecimal codes.

80
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So, of course, it took a screenshot, sent it over to cast blaster mic. Hopefully, you'll be able to decadify it.

81
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But it seems like, you know, access error violation trying to access NTID dot D Ella.

82
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Wait a minute. Let me tell you exactly what it is. Why am I even making it up?

83
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Let's do a prolific programmer on you. Okay. I'm going to read out the error code.

84
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Access violation at address 0.0067AC5 in module cast blaster dot EXE. Read of address 0.0016D0.

85
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Now, that was one error. I know I also saw a different error about some DLL and then I don't know.

86
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And I may have some spyware or some kind of virus in my system because the system was also freaking out.

87
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's stop now, luckily.

88
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And, you know, the servicehost dot EXE that was like, slowly bring up all kinds of CPU power.

89
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm very, very afraid of what's going on right now. This is not not good.

90
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So I'm just hoping that I'll be able to replicate the same error in the same fashion and be able to save this file.

91
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So I can still upload it to you. Sorry for those of you on a Nokia and a hundred tablet that you probably can't listen to this show.

92
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But at least they got it out there. So I don't know. This may require a reinstall of cast blaster.

93
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I may have to go. And I got one of the, you know, I immediately went looking for, because my own, I guess my own spyware detector stuff wasn't finding anything.

94
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And, you know, a quick Google search and I tried, what does it spy eraser?

95
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Those cock suckers. I hate those guys. And I'll tell you why.

96
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Because you run the scan on your system, which takes 25 minutes.

97
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And then it says you've got 87, 87 infected files.

98
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
All right, repair, remove, fix it for me. Oh, no, you have to buy the program by the program.

99
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
29 bucks. Let me see, before I get really angry, I'm going to go to my email.

100
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yep. And then you get a, oh wait, here's a cast blaster Mike just got back to me. Why do you say, what did you do?

101
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh, dude. I don't know. He'll, he'll be able to use this as a bug report, hopefully.

102
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So think you buy that software. And then you got a receipt. Thank you very much for paying.

103
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It may take 24 hours before we can get you your download link.

104
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Fuck, I hate that. It's 2007, boys.

105
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Okay. So I don't want to make the show too long because I actually do have to get some sleep.

106
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But there's so much fun stuff that you've been sending me.

107
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Hello, Adam. This is Kevin, a long time listener from Cambridge with some audio feedback.

108
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm sitting here in the airport and wanted to let you know that your show really helped me out on my travels.

109
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The way that is is I'm used to telling people how to ring the US from the UK.

110
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But I'm not in the habit of having to ring England from America.

111
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But while I was on the trip, I was, I had trouble getting my phone to register the plus sign.

112
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And I wasn't sure if I needed to work trial plus four, or plus zero zero for four, or plus zero one for four, or just zero for four, or zero zero for four.

113
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And all this so, unfortunately, I had in my head P-dub singing in a sort of reggae sort of style plus four, two, seven, that, that, that, that, that, that.

114
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And I just want to let, you know, that's how I managed to get through to my lovely wife while out of the country was because of having P-dub's wonderful,

115
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
wonderful theme song to your show in my head.

116
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Speaking of being away from a loved one and staying in touch using technology, this is the first trip where I had two webcams,

117
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
kidded out so that I could talk to my bride, my lovely wife, and actually we could see each other as well as talk.

118
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I've heard you talk about doing the same thing with the lady Patricia using your webcams and your, or the built-in ones that come with Max.

119
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And I wanted to ask you about something about that.

120
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Isn't it kind of weird how when you're looking at the image of them, they're actually see, they see you looking off to the side.

121
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And when you're looking at the camera, so it looks like you're looking at them, you can actually see them.

122
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No, no, no, no, no, no. You're doing it all wrong, okay. First of all, if you want to have a true eye to eye contact experience, there is an outfit.

123
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I believe it's, what's the name of that guy? He's like a big green investor.

124
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Eckard Winston, Eckard Winston is a Dutch guy. He made, I don't like a hundred million dollars with the sale of some IT services company he had.

125
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And for years, I think I've known him for like seven years. He's been trying to sell this system and he's absolutely right about the system, but it's just way too expensive.

126
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's basically a camera and monitor in one.

127
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And so instead of having your screen where you're looking, and by the way, on the eye Max, it's not too bad.

128
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You're looking down a little bit just a tad because the camera is basically right at the top of the screen.

129
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He has it so that it's kind of like the way a teleprompter works where it's one way glass, I guess you would say.

130
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So the camera is behind the monitor. So you're actually going to be looking straight into this person's face.

131
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And while you're doing that, you're looking into your camera so that you have a true experience.

132
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And yeah, and he has this whole philosophy about how much difference it makes.

133
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And I have to say, I've used this system and it really does make a tremendous difference.

134
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But when you're doing this type of stuff with, with your significant other, which yes indeed, the lady P and I do.

135
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
She's got her eye Mac in the kitchen. I've got an eye Mac here in my in my kitchen as well in the condo.

136
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And we use eye chat to communicate.

137
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If we, when we do that, we typically don't point the cameras that are faces if you know what I mean.

138
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Have you found this? Surely the Mac's are different.

139
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I tried to get the camera as close to the display of my wife as possible, so that when I was looking at the picture, it looked like I was looking at her.

140
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And that's true. But it really doesn't work very well.

141
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So that's my first thoughts of webcam chatting.

142
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Anyway, if you have any thoughts on this, I know you've been using this method for a while.

143
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Thanks a lot for the show. Talk to you later and as you know, folder.

144
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Okay.

145
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Damn, I'm so pissed off about this. You know, much extra work it is to do this.

146
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If you can't write straight to the to the PDN, oh, man.

147
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Is this a windows thing? Is this going to piss me off and make me go back to a Mac? I sure hope not.

148
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Hey, howdy. Thank you very much for letting me into your family of savants.

149
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But could I ask for something if it's not too much of a trouble?

150
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Could I be known as the anonymous podcaster listener?

151
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You know, in my podcast, that's one thing.

152
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'd like oxymoron so much that I actually have an oxymoron of the week.

153
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And I thought it'd be cool if I became known as a podcaster listener because after all.

154
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes, shut up. Tired of you. Let's try this one.

155
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't want to do that. Oh, man.

156
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Things are just not going the way. I want them to wait a minute.

157
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Cast Blaster Mike is emailing me back. Let's see. What he says.

158
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Oh, boy.

159
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Now he's into the details. I can't do that where I'm talking to you guys.

160
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's just move ahead. Hey, Adam, Eric's mom here. Oh, hi, Eric's mom.

161
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So I was reading an article in the Times yesterday and I just didn't understand one thing.

162
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And I thought I'd bring it to your attention and maybe you could help me out here.

163
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The article begins with the sentence, aspiring pop stars can turn to American Idol.

164
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And budding screenwriters had project green light.

165
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So we're to fledgling public radio host, a turn.

166
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Seems as though there's going to be an online contest to find a new national radio star.

167
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Now, the last paragraph goes like this.

168
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Jake Shapiro, the exchange executive director, said he hopes to receive hundreds and hundreds of submissions for the American Idol-style search.

169
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Despite some online grumbling from podcasters, who in recent years have bypassed the radio distribution system and put their own shows on the internet.

170
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So Adam, what exactly doesn't grumbling podcasters sound like?

171
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, hope you're having a great time in San Francisco.

172
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah, not really. I'm pissed off. Thanks for the naked picture though. I appreciated it.

173
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hey, and your son, Eric, I think he sang the National Anthem today at the opening day for the Giants.

174
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
First game. Whoops.

175
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I think he did the anthem with the, with the, with the, the four lead actors of Jersey Boys.

176
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, you know what that sounds like to me, you know, consider the source.

177
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's the New York Times. Doesn't get much more mainstream and established than that.

178
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And I have heard about this. Someone sent me a link to this contest.

179
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh, man. I don't know. Maybe two or three weeks ago.

180
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And I looked at the contest page and it was, you know, it was really interesting because what, what the email said,

181
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
what, what are pointed out is that there were no rules, no terms of service.

182
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You know, what happens if you win. What does that mean? It was like it was really flaky.

183
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But I didn't think much of it thought, okay. Well, yeah, that's all right.

184
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I must say, though, that, you know, this whole, you know, if, if the phrase user generated content isn't disgusting enough,

185
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
everything, everything has to be a fucking contest.

186
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm so, you know, I'm glad that Cas Blasser is busted because it's getting me pissed off.

187
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Everything to these days.

188
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And, and advertising agencies. Oh, gosh.

189
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah, we've got this great, you know, ex-filling the ex-brand of potato chip.

190
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Let's do a contest where people send in their own videos.

191
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Fuck you. Stop it already. I, I'm so sick of it.

192
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I guess that's what a, what grumbling online from podcasts or sounds like.

193
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But I don't, I don't think I heard anyone grumble about the contest.

194
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
To me, that sounds like the New York Times reporter had an interview with this guy from Public Radio.

195
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And, and he said, oh, yeah, it's going to be great, man. You know, fuck all those pod gasters.

196
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
They're already complaining about it because you're, they all suck. They know good. This is about quality talent.

197
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Probably something like that.

198
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I have not heard or read one single thing about it except for that email.

199
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And that was definitely weeks ago.

200
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So, it's fantastic.

201
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And, and I encourage anyone who's on the pod show network to apply.

202
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Please, it's a great idea.

203
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't know.

204
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm sorry. I'm just completely out of it. This is really freaking me out.

205
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Hello.

206
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Hello.

207
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Hey, Adam. Oh, this is Cacone.

208
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Oh, Cacone. I played your song yesterday, indeed.

209
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Thought I would stop by and say a big thank you for playing my latest track.

210
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Get your light up on DSC 575.

211
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I also just wanted to let you other podcasters out there, no?

212
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And you can find, get your light up at the number one place on the web for podsafe music.

213
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You can find the podsafe music network at music dot podshow dot com.

214
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And hey, Adam, thanks again from Cacone.

215
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's what's going to say she was a folder.

216
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Let me just go look back at the podsafe music network for a second.

217
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Hey, how come I can't find Cacone now? What the hell was that?

218
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Cone. I don't see what she looks like.

219
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
How was that?

220
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Nothing is going my way today. I just might add.

221
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Hold on. Let me go to my show notes from yesterday.

222
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Maybe I can find it there.

223
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Cacone. Here we go.

224
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
There's something weird going on with our search as well.

225
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm not quite sure what it is.

226
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay. Well, that's just going blazingly fast.

227
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Damn.

228
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
James, save me.

229
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Adam, James.

230
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I've always, because I've never known you for having TV days.

231
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I guess the liberty of all the sort of years.

232
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You know, obviously, you know, some of your sports.

233
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You know, one of the lads, wife, kids, house, mortgage and all.

234
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
We've got the mortgage bits.

235
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And what's the whole end, bud?

236
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's like they're running out.

237
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
They get your head done.

238
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Jesus.

239
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Great.

240
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Thanks. Sorry.

241
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Can we talk to anybody there?

242
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Thanks.

243
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That's that.

244
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
If you're not there, don't do it.

245
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You're all right.

246
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Hey, come on.

247
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah.

248
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
All right, James.

249
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Let me indulge myself once in a while.

250
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
If I want to fly my own aircraft to get my hair done in Rotterdam,

251
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
it's my prerogative.

252
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And by the way, not a bad idea to clean up a little bit.

253
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I finally found Cacone.

254
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Man, she's hot.

255
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I didn't pay attention when I did the show notes yesterday.

256
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It wasn't looking at the picture.

257
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But very suggestive, sexy picture here.

258
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay. I'll have to go to find her site later on.

259
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Okay. I'm just going to blow through some stuff here,

260
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
because I've got to stop before I heard someone else.

261
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Hello, Adam.

262
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
These salt and the savants.

263
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's us.

264
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He's been here.

265
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I was just listening to Digital Planet on the BBC World Service.

266
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And I was discussing something that's been brought up on the Charlie as well.

267
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And that is a code of conduct for bloggers in the bloggers fee.

268
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And then if he was that they need to be one.

269
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Well, I'm with you, Adam, that they really is no need for a code of conduct.

270
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'll tell you why I believe this is the case.

271
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
First of all, the Internet is a microcosm of society.

272
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And just as you get bad people in the real world,

273
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
you will get the online as well.

274
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
These bad people will use the Internet from the Far East Pipses.

275
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
However, when the people who left these death threats on Mrs. Sierra's blog will get caught,

276
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
it will send a few messages I believe.

277
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I hope you all know what this is about.

278
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
This is about Kathy Sierra.

279
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
She's a consultant. She has a web blog and people are posting death threats in the comments section.

280
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And she, you know, whole bunch of people said this is horrible.

281
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
This has to stop. And of course it's horrible.

282
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Of course it should stop.

283
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah, excuse me, Tylenol PM.

284
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Just in time, too, for you serious satellite radio folks.

285
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You've got more of the pod show on serious coming up.

286
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Right now.

287
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So this Kathy Sierra woman.

288
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
She closed down her web blog and the blogosphere called for a code of conduct.

289
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Which I just can't, I can't fathom how, do people not see what is happening?

290
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What we're actually learning about human nature.

291
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And Aussie Ben, I appreciate your comment, but I think you don't quite see it either.

292
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
This is that this kind of thing is not tolerated.

293
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And that there is no such thing as anonymity online.

294
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The other thing I see is who is going to enforce his code of conduct.

295
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Is it going to be a self-inforced system?

296
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Or will it be, I guess, a group of people who are just with this sort of job of running to blogs,

297
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Deleting posts and what have you.

298
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
If it is a group of people, I can see a few problems with that as well.

299
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And that is, number one is who is going to give these people a power?

300
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Are they going to be, I guess, elected by bloggers?

301
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Are they going to bake it?

302
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

303
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
We can't have a panel.

304
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's just not, what is the Starfleet command?

305
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Aussie Ben, that's not going to work that way.

306
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You can't do it.

307
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
There's no way to police this.

308
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You know, sometimes I think we don't realize that we really unleashed the beast with the internet.

309
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The beast inside all of us, because, you know, of course as people and human beings were all beautiful

310
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and inherently want love and peace for all, but there's also a lot of nasty shit inside every single one of us.

311
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So you can't have a panel for anything.

312
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You know, like the Supreme Court of the internet?

313
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
No.

314
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That obviously won't work.

315
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Sort of body or what have you?

316
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And what happens if they come to my blog and Deleting things in my blog,

317
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
which I, I did, I won out there for the world to say it.

318
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Right.

319
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I just hate too many problems.

320
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Anyways, Adam, have a good one.

321
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah.

322
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And wait for it.

323
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Wait for it.

324
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Folder.

325
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Okay.

326
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah, man.

327
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
No, no, no, no.

328
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I mean, this happens all the time.

329
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Whenever you have a group, a group of more than one person.

330
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So if it's two people or if it's two, 200,000 people doesn't make any difference.

331
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
There's some post something on the internet or put something in a podcast.

332
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I think web blogs propagate much faster, obviously, because it's text and, you know,

333
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
there's a whole infrastructure of, you know, day.com and techno-radi and, you know, all this stuff.

334
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Google, Google alerts, you name it.

335
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
No matter what the spin is, no matter how something is said, people will read that.

336
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And we're conditioned.

337
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
We're just conditioned as human beings of a certain age.

338
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I think it'll, this will change over time as we evolve and understand how to deal and cope with human nature as,

339
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
as we're interconnected to one another.

340
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I wish it was interconnected to cocooni.

341
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Let me tell you now.

342
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
The, you know, the other people within that community, within that group, almost always without fail,

343
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
take that for the truth when someone writes something.

344
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Usually, because they're in the same community, they have the same feelings about different subjects.

345
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So, you know, it's really like pouring fire, pouring on, you know, gas on the fire,

346
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
if you will, more, more petrol and just fanning the flames.

347
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And you know, and the bigger the community, the worst it gets.

348
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And it's just something within us.

349
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
One person gets pissed off.

350
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Another person with similar baggage sees it.

351
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
They throw their baggage right on the same conveyor belt.

352
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And people, people who like people.

353
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
People like to do that.

354
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I do that too.

355
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Everyone projects their own, their own baggage on others.

356
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And sometimes that projection can be pretty fucking nasty.

357
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And that's just the way it is.

358
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.

359
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And there is no court, no rules, no regulations that can stop at the beast has been unleashed.

360
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And there's lots and lots of fantastic stuff we can do for for human nature for us as a civilization.

361
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And unfortunately, there's lots of crap.

362
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I mean, you know, look, why would we be any different as countries nations with our panels and groups and governments and leaders?

363
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You know, we're killing each other's shooting hot lead in fucking deserts.

364
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Why would it be any different?

365
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You know, with the same people who are saying yes to that.

366
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Or, you know, now we're saying no when we want to stop it and it's not really working very well is it.

367
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But are we marching on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?

368
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
No.

369
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Well, not yet.

370
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Actually, there's one person who thinks that podcasting can help to do good.

371
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And he has his own jingle.

372
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Let's have a word with the nylon spread in the news with the smile on where the roller right.

373
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Ringo for light.

374
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Let's listen for the wild to the nylon.

375
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm going to make sure I find the other one.

376
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Okay.

377
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, crap. Oh, no. Oh, no.

378
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Oh, Jesus.

379
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Oh, this is not good. I just tried to open another nylon jingle and a crap.

380
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Oh, please.

381
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And I got an access violation at address 060677AAC5 and modulecastblaster.exe.

382
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Read of address 01101610.

383
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
If I click OK, that mean that may mean the end of the show.

384
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
If it continues to record, I'll continue.

385
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So I'll just say goodbye right now.

386
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And we'll have to save nylon until tomorrow.

387
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Here we go. Let's see what happens.

388
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Are you still there?

389
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Thank God.

390
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
They worked.

391
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
They had them and they were finished by a message.

392
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So here's what I want.

393
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I want a mercy embassy.

394
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I want the power of podcasting, the power of the audience.

395
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I want them to encourage every listener to send a email to the Iranian embassy near their home town.

396
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That's the power.

397
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
That's the power of podcasting.

398
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So let's move the needle.

399
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Let's move this from B to B sort of thing to a B to W business world.

400
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Let's use the power of podcasting to do something good for the world.

401
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And that word of apple and D are in for the near turn.

402
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So if you want to move the needle at him, here's my challenge to you.

403
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Get podcast, B to eat, partner work, everyone.

404
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Send a letter to the Iranian embassy.

405
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Free the British hostages.

406
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Then, then, only then.

407
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And I say podcasting in the new world in the new media, a new way has moved the needle.

408
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And I'm glad that the access violation didn't violate you.

409
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah, okay, so you want to bum rush the embassy.

410
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah, okay.

411
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
First of all, I disagree because clearly,

412
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
the outlet the UK was over there.

413
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And it's in dispute whether they were in their territorial waters or not.

414
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And as I talked about yesterday, there's quite a history of Britain and Persia or Iran and the United Kingdom.

415
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
The goes back to the beginning of 1903.

416
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And there's been a lot of aggression, a lot of manipulation.

417
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Maybe it's just time that Tony Blair said, oh, sorry mate.

418
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
We'll get our fucking people out of there.

419
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Didn't mean to overstep the boundary.

420
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You know, just so you know, we're here.

421
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Sorry, didn't mean to do that.

422
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Just say something like that.

423
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Just be, you know, take the high road on this, will ya?

424
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So, everyone in podcasting.

425
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Please send that to Tony Blair.

426
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But really nylon, I want you to understand that I didn't get into this to save the world.

427
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Well, I did kind of, as long as I can also win valuable prizes.

428
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I mean, for me, podcasting is different.

429
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You know, it's a creative outlet and it's a way for me to get naked pictures.

430
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
What's playin' on?

431
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
All right, so I'm gonna cut this just a little bit short.

432
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Because I'm afraid that you're gonna get screwed somewhere.

433
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Maybe I'll try a complete reinstall of cast blasts or see if that works.

434
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Okay, being in the curry condo means, of course, I'm back reunited and it feels so good.

435
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
With my first generation iPod, which sits here in the...

436
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Well, we had the Logitech MM50 speaker doc, which was, by the way, one of our first advertisers on the network.

437
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So, let me plug it in here.

438
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And, you know, I have it on shuffle, so let me just see what comes out.

439
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Oh, let me turn this down.

440
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh, yes!

441
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Oh, what a jam.

442
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Your size.

443
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
To rescue my eyes and shades of green.

444
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Under dreaming spot.

445
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
To eat your book.

446
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
That's where I've been.

447
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
What did you do there?

448
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I got hot.

449
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
What did you do there?

450
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I got hot.

451
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
What did you do there?

452
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Tell you why.

453
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It's all too beautiful.

454
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It's all too beautiful.

455
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's all too beautiful.

456
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It's all too beautiful.

457
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Kind.

458
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You know, my mind gets too tall.

459
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Don't swallow up my mind.

460
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,000
They won't come out.

461
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Tell you what I do.

462
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
What do you do?

463
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'd like to go there now with you.

464
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You can miss out.

465
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'd like to let me know.

466
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
What did you do there?

467
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I got hot.

468
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
What did you do there?

469
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I got hot.

470
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
What did you do there?

471
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I got hot.

472
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's all too beautiful.

473
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's all too beautiful.

474
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's all too beautiful.

475
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's all too beautiful.

476
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's all too beautiful.

477
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's all too beautiful.

478
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's all too beautiful.

479
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's all too beautiful.

480
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's all too beautiful.

481
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It's all too beautiful.

482
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's all too beautiful.

483
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Oh man, back in the day when we had that phasing effect, which was manually produced

484
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,000
by running two tape simultaneously, mixing the signals through the mixing board and then

485
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
slowing down one of them just a tad.

486
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You got that nice phasing effect.

487
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
The small faces, it's a coup-park from Adam's first gen iPod, which we celebrate with the

488
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Jingle.

489
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Fuck, not that one.

490
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Okay, I can't wait to hear more about the first gen iPod later in the week here on the

491
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Charlie from Northern California.

492
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Hey Adam, this is Richard and today we're going to see this story today that record

493
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
companies that have a little UK commercial radio stations to allow them to play music in their

494
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
podcast.

495
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's almost the most radio station podcast in the UK.

496
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It's just a presenter talking with their music which is pretty dire.

497
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
But now they're a deal to play 30 seconds of songs in their podcast.

498
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
30 seconds that's crap.

499
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You want to hear 30 seconds?

500
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You want to hear a whole thing.

501
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Even if it means that you're the talker at the beginning of the end.

502
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
30 seconds?

503
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
One of the other books.

504
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Anyway, by now.

505
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
All right, man.

506
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
What's your?

507
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
No, no, what's all that?

508
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Okay, thank you.

509
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Just scared me for a second there.

510
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
That is pretty interesting.

511
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
No, I did not see the news report.

512
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I didn't hear anyone about it.

513
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Didn't see anything.

514
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Does it fall under a part of their part of the BBC's license?

515
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'd be interested to know for sure.

516
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
But indeed, 30 seconds come on.

517
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Well, we're getting closer.

518
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I guess if you put that together with what happened with the announcement from EMI about them,

519
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
removing digital rights management and that being sold to the iTunes store, higher quality,

520
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
all that stuff.

521
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
There are things happening.

522
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Things are starting to adjust.

523
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I should go back to my predictions again from the beginning of the year.

524
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Let's see how close we've come.

525
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I have a feeling.

526
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm not far off.

527
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
All right.

528
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Tomorrow will be much better.

529
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I promise.

530
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Thanks for sitting through all this crap.

531
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And I must say, looking at Kaconie's picture, helped a lot.

532
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Another punch hole podcast.

533
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Stick it in your ear.

534
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
The best in the brightest served up daily by the sharpest minds in content delivery,

535
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
punch hole and line weight.
