1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey, Kathy, what you doing?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh, I was just getting the bedtime stories.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My kids love intro ready for daily source code 541.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Fulger's coffee.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Wait a minute.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Did you just say Fulger's coffee?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yep, what abouts in sale?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Things have changed again.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And now, every time you burp, it's Fulger's.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Really?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So it's not like...

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Splendor?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Nope.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's not Fulger's coffee?

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yep.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
All right.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Fulger's?

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Very good, Pearl.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now it's time to introduce the show.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Daily source code 541.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
With 15 bags of Splendor stuck in our pants.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Sugar!

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And 15 bags of toilet paper hanging from our cracks.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We don't need no sticking sugar!

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'd like to think I'm right.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
For the future.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll be honest if she is so serious.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I need somebody else.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll just anybody else.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You know I need someone else.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
When I was young, I was so much younger than today.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I never knew if anybody's helping anyway.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now that now these days are gone, I'm not so selfish.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Sure.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now that I find the gym mind, I don't burn up the doors.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'd like to appreciate you being around.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Help me if my feet's right on the ground.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Won't you please please help me?

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I've found out my life has changed so so many ways.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I have deep breath and seems to vanish in the days.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But if I'm now in my heart, I feel so insecure.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I know I'd just be right.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I never done before.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'd like to appreciate you being around.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Help me if my feet's right on the ground.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Won't you please please help me?

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I've found out my life has changed so many ways.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I never knew if anybody's helping anyway.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Now that now these days are gone, I'm not so selfish.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sure.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now that I find the gym mind, I don't burn up the doors.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'd like to appreciate you being around.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Help me if my feet's right on the ground.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Won't you please help me if you can, I'm feeling down.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What's this?

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Am I out of my mind?

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Am I crazy?

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Have I finally flipped my lid?

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Have I smoked one split too many?

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh my goodness.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Do I want to go to jail?

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, my friends.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You just heard the future of the legacy of Steve Jobs.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yep.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What happened yesterday was monumental.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And I want to talk to you about it.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And I'm not worried at all about playing the Beatles.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
One of the most protected copyrighted artists of all time.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I would have to say, most well-managed.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Most one of the most profitable catalogs.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Because things are going to change very rapidly.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I've probably seen online in the headline and newspapers all across the globe today.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
An essay that Steve Jobs wrote called Thoughts on Music.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And it really focuses in hones in on the use of digital rights management.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And he makes an argument.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And quite a compelling case that selling music without digital rights management.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In other words, restrictions, which means, well, to cut through to it.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Eventually, everything would be on MP3.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And you could copy to any device and you could share it around with friends.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You could do whatever you'd want with it.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But it will actually sell more music than the current state of the union, if you will.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Excuse me.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Fulger's Coffee.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And it's only part of the story.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And this is a very carefully orchestrated strategy that Steve Jobs has been working on for,

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I believe, quite some time.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We came more or less apparent to me a few weeks ago at the Apple keynote at Mac world,

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
where Steve Jobs slipped in a couple of Beatles tracks during his infamous keynote.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Not only did he do that, but he announced that Apple computer wouldn't be known as Apple Inc.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And lo and behold.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And of course, I don't know the details if it's a true acquisition or exactly what the deal is.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But believe me, Steve Jobs is an excellent businessman.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And the deal that he did with Apple Records is completely to the benefit of everybody, including Apple.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And of course, indirectly Steve Jobs.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And let me see if I can explain this to you because I see this strategy unfolding clearly before our very eyes.

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So Steve Jobs knows what the real money is in music.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's in the publishing.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's in licensing.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And he knows because he's been on the payment end of this by paying for Beatles cataloged to use in Apple commercial.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I think maybe he used a revolution that may have been a couple others.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It probably were.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So he knows what kind of money that's, what kind of money that can mean.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
At the same time, he also knows that the money that he makes on sales through the iTunes music stores,

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
pretty much negligible.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Of course, 2 billion of anything is a lot of money or it's a lot of anything.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But it's really just to spit in the bucket if you compare it to Apple's core business and where they're headed.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let me see if I can get this all down for you.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So what he's pleading for and in this memo and of course, there's a link to it.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If you haven't read it already, there's a link to it from the show notes on today's podcast daily source code.com.

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You'll see that he's making very,

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
a major plea to the other major record labels or to the major record labels to sell DRM free because he's making a comparison.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You really got to read the words carefully.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He's making a comparison between CDs and the iPod.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And certainly with the way pricing is working and more is law and all that stuff.

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The iPod without a doubt is the CD of the future.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
People are always going to pay for packaging.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And we know that there are more honest people than there are dishonest people.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We've proven that with podcasting artists who are member of the pod safe music network have contributed their music free.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And clear, of course, it could be by definition.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's being downloaded by podcasters.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
They're using it in their show, which creates another copy, which of course, if you really wanted to, you could go and rip it off.

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
People aren't doing that.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And because it's very simple to go and buy a track through the pod safe music network or garage band or CD baby or iTunes music store anywhere,

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
because that process has become very simple.

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
People are doing it because they, you know, they'll buy a CD from CD baby.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why do they want the packaging?

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How successful do you think that you too iPod was?

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I have a feeling it was extremely successful.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And so of course, of course, Steve Jobs knows that the way to go is to package the content.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
In this case, the, I would presume the entire Beatles catalog to package that into special iPods.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Perhaps even preloaded on on max that you buy in the store.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I believe that in the future, you may even have an iPod for your Beatles music and iPod for your commute and iPod for your podcasts,

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
maybe nice.

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think that's very possible.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And they'll be completely interchangeable.

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What's the difference?

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're just picking up a piece of plastic.

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You know, a little piece of plastic.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You slip it in.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You stick, you're jam the buds in your ears and you're off.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And you've got whatever you want.

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You can easily carry a couple of these things with you.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And they'll become just like CDs.

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And that's that packaging is what Jobs knows so much about.

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He knows exactly how to sell to the, to the, to the customer to his customer.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So the way, I think this is the next step for him.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And if you do the math, I think it really works out.

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I believe that now that Steve Jobs has, in effect, become a record company and owns, at least owns the rights to do something with the Beatles catalog.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He will put that out free and clear of DRM.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It'll be his choice.

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And I'm sure he's, he's talked it over with the, with the Apple, formerly former Apple records people.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It'll be free and clear. It'll be packaged in max. It'll be packaged in iPods.

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And that's where the money's coming from.

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And it's going to be huge much more.

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What, what do you hear the Beatles on the radio anymore?

159
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Where do you hear it?

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You don't, except on Beatles specific stations.

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I've paid for this for these tracks 10 times in my life on all kinds of different collectors, CDs, vinyl, all the packaging.

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's all about the packaging.

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And you know what, of course, I'll buy a Beatles iPod. Are you kidding me?

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But by doing this, and this is where I think he sees the light, his, his legacy.

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
By being the first big quote label to step forward.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And to say, you know what, here it is. This is how it's done.

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Watch the money come on in suckas.

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He's going to break it wide open.

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And you'll see every single record company selling through multiple channels.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It'll play on any device. You'll be able to do anything you want with it.

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Because the real true money when you have a hit record, a hit song,

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
is in the licensing. It's in the publishing and to get it to people.

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
They'll gladly pay extra money if you put it into the right packaging.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And that is why I'm not worried about playing the Beatles on this podcast.

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, that, and of course, the fact that it was such a crappy video version.

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I stole off of my space.

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But I don't think anyone would ever want to go and rip that one out.

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But this is going to be a very exciting year.

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm, I'm convinced of it.

180
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And just listen to this.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Here's some of the reasoning that I love.

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Today's most popular iPod holds 1,000 songs and research tells us that the average iPod is nearly full.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Listen to how he's talking about the iPod.

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You know, this is like, it's like me who with Jaguars and you know, the ash trace full up,

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
time to buy a new one.

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The iPod's full up, time to buy a new one.

187
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't want to take tracks off.

188
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't want to have to manage that.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Look, it costs me 40 bucks to buy the Beatles in the iPod.

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Maybe it's 60.

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Maybe it's 100.

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Who cares?

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And you'll buy, you know, the next yell and bands will be releasing their albums on special iPod.

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is, it is so clear that this is where it's going.

195
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And there are lessons and not just lessons, but there's also a place in here for podcasting.

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So, what can I do?

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Let's have some fun with this.

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh, yeah.

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't, this is Gabe real one of your listeners in Dublin, Ireland.

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Now, I was reading the news recently.

201
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That the UK charts for the top singles have been revamped.

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So, now that any downloaded track, as long as it's registered with the system, is in the

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
running to be in the chart.

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I was, as you might have heard, this is caused a bit of, you know, dramatic or people,

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you know, old TV teams going into the charts and Chris Moiles ran a little campaign to get

206
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
someone back into the charts and he succeeded getting into number 17.

207
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
All I was thinking is, is there any plans for podshow music network?

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:31,000
To register with the system so that podsafe artists could potentially get some recognition on

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the charts.

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You know, this is a very good question.

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm glad you bring it up in the context of, in the context of what we're talking about in

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Holland.

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Sorry.

214
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I turned something up a little too far.

215
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

216
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's better.

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't want to blow your ear drums out.

218
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah.

219
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Okay.

220
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So, it's not going to matter because the only chart that is going to matter is going

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
to be the iTunes chart.

222
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
iTunes will become the largest record company in the world.

223
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's all there.

224
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
They've got the marketing.

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They've got the distribution.

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
They've got the customer base.

227
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What else do record companies do?

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You know, nothing.

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So, of course, you know, the hope is is that there will be enough exposure for indie artists.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But once this starts to build out and once DRM is removed and everyone's comfortable with

231
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
this equation, you're going to see all kinds of players and stores and wonderful ways to package

232
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and distribute music.

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And it will no longer be on this track.

234
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Of course, people will buy in a track by track basis, but there's so much.

235
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But people love music.

236
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
There's so much money.

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And finally, this shit is being broken.

238
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So, for us, what's important because this is where podcasting does play a very big role.

239
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What's important for us is the pod play chart.

240
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
If you go to podshow.com slash music, any genre you click on, you'll see a chart of the

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
top songs in that genre as determined by pod play from podcasters who are member of the

242
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
pod safe music network, that's going to be a very important number because they're still

243
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
nothing more powerful than hearing your song on podcasts all over the world.

244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There is no more powerful marketing message when your friend, even if you're a group of

245
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
a thousand or a hundred or ten thousand or five hundred thousand, if someone says, hey, I like

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
this song.

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Check it out.

248
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's the type of endorsement that radio it gives in mainstream media today.

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And it's the type of endorsement of the future.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Or the qualities there.

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And I'm quite sure that, you know, if you had the distribution now because there are two.

252
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And you have all these people playing these songs.

253
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It would be nice to get these artists directly nice on a wider level.

254
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You know, outside the podcasting world.

255
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I thought that might one way or two.

256
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Alright, now I appreciate it.

257
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So there you go.

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's all going to change.

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
God, I'm so excited about this.

260
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Okay, let's see.

261
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Where are we at right now?

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hi, Adam.

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's Eric Bergen.

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You might remember my name.

265
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm the host of Green Room Radio in Arts and Entertainment podcast.

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And in fact, we were one of the first podcasts to feature a theme song by Jeff Smith.

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Anyway, here's why I'm sending in this audio comment.

268
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I was very involved in the podcasting world almost since the beginning.

269
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
In fact, that was one of your first listeners.

270
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And I was a dedicated listener. I listened every single day.

271
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
In August, I made the decision to stop listening.

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
This was in about early to mid August.

273
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And the decision came out of the fact that my other life, which was that of an actor,

274
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
actually started picking up steam and I started getting work.

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And I was in rehearsals all day and doing shows at night.

276
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And I just didn't have time for podcasting anymore.

277
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I haven't done an episode of my own podcast since May.

278
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Don't worry. We're coming back next week.

279
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But I just, I just need to know.

280
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I need a little update because I want to rejoin the daily source code listening experience.

281
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But I need to know what's going on.

282
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I can't just join the show and not know what's going on.

283
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Did you move? It sounded like you moved houses?

284
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What's this free Trinity thing?

285
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I need if you could just give me or maybe one of your listeners could give me just a three minute update

286
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
of everything I need to know that's been happening in the daily source code world since I guess mid August.

287
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The last time I checked in in August, the pod show website had just gone public.

288
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But I think that was really the biggest thing that was going on then.

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So if you could just, just let me know, just catch me up on everything.

290
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm sorry to ask you.

291
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I just, I want to rejoin, but I can't just rejoin and not know what's going on.

292
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's like trying to join 24 in the middle of the season.

293
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You don't know what the hell's going on.

294
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Also, next time you're in San Francisco,

295
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm here for a while doing a little show called Jersey Boys playing at the current theater.

296
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And I know Adam that you sort of are a Jersey boy because you lived there.

297
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Now, the show isn't about you.

298
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The show is actually about Frankie Valley and the four seasons.

299
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But I'd love for you to come.

300
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
We're playing at the current theater right on Gary Street.

301
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's right near Pod Show HQ.

302
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So why don't you come on down.

303
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'll pay for your ticket.

304
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I promise.

305
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay, that's all.

306
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Just someone give me an update.

307
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Please.

308
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Dude, you got to stick with it.

309
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Although I really do appreciate the comparison with 24.

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, that's nice.

311
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Well, there's a challenge.

312
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Anyone want to put that together?

313
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It might be necessary.

314
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That is a good point.

315
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And I really appreciate the invite.

316
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes, of course.

317
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll take you up on it.

318
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I think I'm in San Francisco the week of the 19th.

319
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So let's say if we can hook it up, I would love to come to see that.

320
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's, you know, I've had my eye on that production for a while.

321
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And I didn't know that, you know, there really is kind of a theater district in San Francisco.

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Is there any good?

323
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Is it, are they, you know, what are the things that we're going to find out, I guess, aren't we?

324
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Planting a Jamaican get away?

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Fly stone.

326
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Our stone attendance will see that you arrive with a load.

327
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Stone Airlines to Jamaica.

328
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Fly above the clouds and arrive with a head full of steam when you get there.

329
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And save money with our specially economy flights, only 29.95.

330
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Jump once you to fly.

331
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Hey, Adam.

332
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's Seth Harwood, longtime DSC listener.

333
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
After hearing the first few chapters of Mark Yoshimoto Nemcoff's kick-ass pod novel,

334
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Number one with a bullet.

335
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And Scott Sigler's awesome, the rookie.

336
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I thought it was time for me to bring my podcast novel, Jack wakes up over to pod show.

337
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Jack wakes up is about what happens when Jack palms.

338
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
A one hit wonder, X action movie actor hits the streets of San Francisco

339
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
to help a group of check drug buyers make one big score.

340
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
A drug deal that he hopes will set him up for life.

341
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But when things turn difficult, he has to decide what side of acting and action he's on.

342
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Thanks, Adam, for all the great pod show podcasts.

343
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And I'm looking forward to getting to know more people in the pod show community.

344
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
When you get a chance, go check out Jack wakes up at Jack wakes up. podshow.com.

345
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I shall do exactly that.

346
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Thank you very much and welcome to the show.

347
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Absolutely.

348
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This is a format that we haven't even talked about.

349
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The stuff, Mark Yoshimoto Nemcoff's doing, Scott Sigler.

350
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There's a podiobooks.com.

351
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
This is really an interesting audio format.

352
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And we're seeing people create books in an audience online

353
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and then selling the physical hard copy again.

354
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We're back to my favorite word of the week, packaging.

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
In our continuing quest to find out if posh people are potty pigs,

356
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
we find out some more interesting tidbits today.

357
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
By the way, I'm in my training period now.

358
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I am now officially a folder and a sitter.

359
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I got some interesting software the other day.

360
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm going to try out its SMS software so we can do voting here on the chat chat.

361
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So you can just SMS, it would be folder or scruncher,

362
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
sitter or standard.

363
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Actually, let me just, well, I'll mess with you right in a second.

364
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Hold on, let's see.

365
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Our first posh poddy comments.

366
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Hi, Adam.

367
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm Darren from Beautiful Melvin and Australia here.

368
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Just thought I'd like to chime in on the posh poddy habits.

369
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Three.

370
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I work for three years at one of Australia's most prestigious financial institutions.

371
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
There's some very smart research monkeys, investment bankers and the like.

372
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Without doubt, it had the most disgusting tolls of any place that I'd previously worked.

373
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We had a fandom sprayer as well.

374
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It was not unusual to walk into the stall in the morning and find,

375
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
well, sheet in places I didn't think you can normally get it.

376
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He obviously didn't have much of a fire in his diet.

377
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He didn't hear for a while, then returned.

378
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Unfortunately, we were unable to track down the culprit.

379
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
On the Trinity project, let's get her around the world.

380
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Get her into a container and on a ship from the Mead to Perth Western Australian.

381
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
We'll pick her up and dry her across the Malibu plane to Sydney.

382
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's the equivalent distance of about London to Moscow.

383
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
We can pop her back into a ship to New Zealand and get my other key.

384
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We guys to cut a lap in New Zealand and then back on a ship to Auckland for Los Angeles.

385
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Us can play in a second navigation.

386
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
There is a challenge.

387
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Thanks for the show.

388
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I've been listening since about the first six months of the day.

389
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I still look forward to my daily day of sea fix.

390
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Cheers, Mike.

391
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Alright.

392
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I miss Australia.

393
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I really want to go there again.

394
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Of course, of course you'll make it to Australia.

395
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
She's not going to stop. She's going to keep going around the world.

396
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I know it because there's enough people who are going to fix her up and keep her running.

397
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I can't wait to get there on the road and get this project started.

398
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's going to take a couple more weeks, but it will happen and we're going to get her rolling.

399
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
We're good for bad.

400
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Trinity update coming in just a couple seconds.

401
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I am.

402
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's Melvin from Seoul again.

403
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You asked for more toilet towels in the Orient.

404
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You might think that South Korea's economic success has been built on manufacturing

405
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
motor cars, ships, electronics, or even knockoffs.

406
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But no.

407
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Don't actually build on oral healthcare.

408
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Trinity hours of 12 to 2 each day.

409
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
About 20 million Koreans in factories and offices in construction sites will brush their teeth.

410
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
In my office you have to force your way past the 3D cure at the sinks.

411
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So I think that's 4 sets isn't that much.

412
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
To get anywhere near the men's room.

413
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Then you arrive at the store.

414
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Here you get the usual smells and noises.

415
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The creep out from underneath the toilet door.

416
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Sometimes you get something a little bit extra.

417
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You get the sound of brushing teeth.

418
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's really quite weird.

419
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Cheers.

420
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Wow.

421
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You sounded like a Brit.

422
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah.

423
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Just to be stereotypical.

424
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
For Brits, it may be weird to brush your teeth after lunch.

425
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But it's a pretty good habit actually to have.

426
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I want to add there.

427
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Okay.

428
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
We learned a little bit.

429
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Not an entire amount about.

430
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
About the problem at hand.

431
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But it does seem that worldwide.

432
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
People have the strangest bathroom habits when they're in public.

433
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
While their bathrooms at home could be impeccably clean.

434
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The quest continues.

435
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Defined out.

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Are Posh.

437
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
People.

438
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Poti.

439
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Pigs.

440
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Pigs.

441
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Bik.

442
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Gosset is a fine.

443
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Question.

444
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yes.

445
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It is.

446
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Are Posh.

447
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Pigs.

448
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
C'mon strip.

449
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
C'mon strip.

450
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
C'mon strip.

451
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
C'mon strip.

452
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
C'mon strip.

453
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
C'mon strip.

454
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
C'mon strip.

455
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
C'mon strip.

456
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
C'mon strip.

457
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
C'mon strip.

458
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I beat you.

459
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Hello.

460
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Cary Adam.

461
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And the same to your charming madam.

462
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It is me.

463
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The C S B.

464
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
as B and tomorrow in London I will be.

465
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Please be nice and don't be late so that I won't have to wait.

466
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Fortunately, World War II is over.

467
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So my German airplane will not be shot above tover.

468
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This interview will be only about mobile phones

469
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and I bring two stereo superb microphones.

470
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
See you tomorrow in the meeting.

471
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Please remember this reminder greeting.

472
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Oh.

473
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah.

474
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Did you hear that?

475
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The satellite window closed right in the middle of CSB.

476
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yep, tomorrow.

477
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh, it's all this excitement that's going on.

478
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And by the way, today we're picking a Patricia Smart Roadster.

479
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah, she's so excited.

480
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
She's like a little girl.

481
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
She has a whole day planned for tomorrow.

482
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
She wants to...

483
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
She has like a Barbie card.

484
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's perfect.

485
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
That's what all girly girls want.

486
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
She's got a day of driving.

487
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
She's going to the nail salon.

488
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
She's going to drive and see how much shopping she can get in.

489
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You know, grocery shopping.

490
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
That's very cool.

491
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So mixed all of that tomorrow in London.

492
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:33,000
To PM, I'm meeting with online superhero of the interesting comic strip blogger.

493
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And we're going to shoot it.

494
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
We're going to do some video.

495
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Because I think a lot of people are very curious to see what he looks like and to hear him talk.

496
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Is this real voice?

497
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Is it a real guy?

498
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And I am myself quite excited about it because how long have we been communicating

499
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
with each other.

500
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And even though sometimes he goes off the rails for, you know, for the rest of the audience,

501
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
he's, I think he's a reasonable guy.

502
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So, you know, yes, he's interviewing me.

503
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You know, I'll be able to slip some questions in and we'll learn lots of stuff.

504
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You know, that's going to happen.

505
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Beautiful day to day again.

506
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I hope it's going to be the same on Friday.

507
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Blue skies.

508
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Very, very cold in the UK.

509
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Minus six degrees Celsius this morning when Christina and I got into the car.

510
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And the predicting snow for tomorrow, which, of course, could,

511
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
could kind of ruin Patricia's day of barbie car driving.

512
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Hi Adam, it's Eric.

513
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
West with the beach happens to go.

514
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I just wanted to make a couple of comments.

515
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You had the best song ever that I've heard on your show with Beat Hopkins a yesterday

516
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
on the DSC.

517
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I think it was by 40 actually.

518
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Congratulations on over 500.

519
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I don't know if I'm going to take this further down there a month.

520
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I'm starting up my podcast again.

521
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But the other thing I wanted to comment on was on, I believe,

522
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
in the spot 39 where you stated, you leave your machine's arm.

523
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It is actually a noted fact that most systems are made for continuous run.

524
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That includes elevators, computers, just rides.

525
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So, leaving them on actually last longer than turning them on and off.

526
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
But the actual turning them on and off, that actually,

527
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
short and very light.

528
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Anyway, just by giving you a comment and thanks for the DSC.

529
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I listen every day.

530
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You're first thing in the morning.

531
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And when you're the only chef in Cisco,

532
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
please keep doing this show at 11 o'clock at night.

533
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Because that way I have it first thing in the morning

534
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
when I'm on my way to work.

535
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Talk to you later.

536
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Bye.

537
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The eye man, you got it.

538
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Thanks for calling in.

539
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And of course, you've opened up the geek box of Pandora with this comment.

540
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Because I think there are equal opinions on either side of the

541
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
leave him on or switch him off debate as it pertains to computers,

542
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
to tubes, to light bulbs, to just about anything I think.

543
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But I have to say my personal experience.

544
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And that's just because I'm old enough to seeing crap die along the way.

545
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Is leave him on.

546
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
For those of you not familiar with Raymond, Raymond Port.

547
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
He's a good friend of the Charlie.

548
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And he was the guy that while I was recording a daily source code

549
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
on a commute from Amsterdam to the Curry Castle in Belgium.

550
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
That all of a sudden he pulled up alongside me.

551
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
He was honking his horn.

552
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
We were in kind of heavy traffic.

553
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And he says, dude, I'm listening to you right now.

554
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And listen to daily source code.

555
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And I was like, dude, I'm recording one.

556
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And it was like a loop.

557
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It was a connection.

558
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It was a really interesting moment in the history of this show.

559
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Certainly, maybe a podcasting in general.

560
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And Raymond's made some pretty big decisions in this life recently.

561
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I think he's leaving his current job.

562
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And he's trying to find out where he wants to go and what he wants to do.

563
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And he was in traffic recently.

564
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And what else you're going to do when your name's ready?

565
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Hey, Adam.

566
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's Raymond from the Netherlands.

567
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm on a road trip today.

568
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That can post Germany.

569
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Most time in the car.

570
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And the traffic jam is all over.

571
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Since it's starting snowing here.

572
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Where are you?

573
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I miss you on the lane.

574
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Let me stuck in the same city traffic jam.

575
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You're all the A-A, or the Shigwar V-A, or Smart Roadster.

576
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Or Trinity.

577
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'll have some time on my hands.

578
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I totally dig the free Trinity project from early March.

579
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'll have no, they jump.

580
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Why don't you go up and drive around for a day or so?

581
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Let me know what you think.

582
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And it might happen.

583
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Okay.

584
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Fine.

585
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Out.

586
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Holder.

587
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That's right, Ray.

588
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Actually, we're changing it now.

589
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
No longer are you a folder, but you're a folders.

590
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So next time you do your business, you'll think of my sponsors.

591
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It works.

592
00:29:47,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You can't help but sing along.

593
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
The Trinity, Trinity, the quintessential luxury.

594
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Trinity, Trinity, Trinity's at the bio diesel set.

595
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You're free Trinity.

596
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That's right.

597
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
We're taking my baby poo colored Mercedes 300 turbo diesel.

598
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Station wagon from 1984 running on Veggie Oil.

599
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Better known as biodiesel across the USA and around the globe.

600
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
We're signing up.

601
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
We're getting the group together.

602
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
There's a link at the show notes daily source code.com.

603
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
To the Google group, you want to join.

604
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You want to let your presence be known.

605
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
We're collecting all your data.

606
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
We're going to be mapping out Trinity's root pretty soon.

607
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And of course, everyone gets your chance to drive.

608
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Everyone gets a chance to fill her up.

609
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Everyone gets a chance to repair her along the way.

610
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Trust me.

611
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I know cars.

612
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So that's the concept.

613
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And of course, she'll be sending back GPS coordinates and video and photo at regular intervals.

614
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And all we're looking for now really is to find someone who can build a strap on box that will perform these wonderful functions.

615
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I think we might have someone in the prolific programmer.

616
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I've asked him to send me some links to some of the work he's done.

617
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But anyone who calls himself the prolific programmer either is a damn good programmer.

618
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Or he's got elephant-sized balls.

619
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Of course, I wasn't completely correct about what I told you about him yesterday.

620
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So he called in to correct me.

621
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Hello.

622
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I don't know who's coming here.

623
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I just wanted to tell you that.

624
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And email me at first.

625
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
We have that to you because that's relevant part.

626
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Um, I was immediately 540.

627
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm having a good new girlfriend.

628
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You're glad to request me the prolific programmer involved for you.

629
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But through Trinity project, I would love to.

630
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I did, however, I just bought sent to a friend to send a dinner and to a camera.

631
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay.

632
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I can't think that's the effort in any kind of the present.

633
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Then you mentioned that they were doing a machine level and I realized that's right.

634
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Colin.

635
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So I'm nice to join you on the other way.

636
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Um, I would also because you come to the area often enough and I'm usually in the area.

637
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I would love to be able to.

638
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
We should discuss the city by other projects over a day or some time.

639
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Either let me know to the DSC or you can't.

640
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I mean, blog at post it for them.

641
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And come such a little bit.

642
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Thank you.

643
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Awesome.

644
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I love you, man.

645
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I don't think anyone can understand what the fuck you're saying.

646
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
But I do love you.

647
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I think you're a true character.

648
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And okay.

649
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Here's the deal.

650
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I got no time to have dinner with anybody.

651
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm sorry.

652
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I just don't.

653
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You know, that's just not the way my life works.

654
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Certainly not when I'm San Francisco because, you know,

655
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
dinner is like something from the, from the takeaway or it's a frozen food dinner.

656
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And then I do the show at night.

657
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah, just don't have the time.

658
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But I did talk to my friend over at Nokia.

659
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And if I'm convinced and then I'll convince him that we have the right people who

660
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,000
actually want to build on this wonderful open and 800 Linux based platform.

661
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
He does have some development machines available.

662
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So let's get the group together guys.

663
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Let's, let's, you know, communicate it all through the Google group.

664
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Again, you can find a link to that at dailysourcecode.com.

665
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I don't.

666
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Thank you, Jeff Smith.

667
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I love you, man.

668
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Okay. So as a part of the quest to get Trinity on the road.

669
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
We're in the midst of hiring and I'll just call it a producer.

670
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
For a couple of things for the entire project.

671
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And then a whole bunch of shit that goes along with the project.

672
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And that is Barbara the Palo Alto podcaster.

673
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Dear diary, you know that dreamy Adam Curry.

674
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'm always telling you about.

675
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I think he's trying to kill me.

676
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
We're Trinity and I think we should get our going.

677
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And a week or two when I get back to San Francisco.

678
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I think we're almost ready.

679
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's ready.

680
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Hey Adam.

681
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's Barbara and Palo Alto.

682
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Trinity's Galpel.

683
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You know, the one who almost had a coronary when you said the road trip was close to starting?

684
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Well, we are making a lot of progress.

685
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And I love your enthusiasm for the project.

686
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
There are still a lot of pieces we have to put into place before Trinity can get rolling.

687
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So please, let's wait until we have more than a handful of invitations.

688
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Before we start talking about a time frame.

689
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Okay?

690
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Oh, man.

691
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
How about helping me get my heart started again with a little music?

692
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So I guess this means David came through for you, huh?

693
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Well, now.

694
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Chocolate cake makes my poor stomach ache.

695
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And listen.

696
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Next time you get a hold of some KW that send you off into fantasy land like that.

697
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Dude, you got a share.

698
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
The coffee and refill makes me feel alright.

699
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
First of all, method making you hide.

700
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But I've never liked going five days without sniffing.

701
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
As it makes you say stupid things like,

702
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm sorry.

703
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The coffee and refill makes you feel alright.

704
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's all that takes you high.

705
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It takes you low.

706
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
The beans are making fly.

707
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
All the mud will make you slow.

708
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Shooting speed balls will make you sell your stereo.

709
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But you never heard of going in hawk.

710
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
For a cup of Joe.

711
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You know the crank will end you right in the crank.

712
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Smoke that nasty crack yet you want to rob a bank.

713
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Forget the nicotine, it can't even be.

714
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It bends a dream.

715
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Try golfing and refill full a real mellow seat.

716
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah.

717
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000

The cop to channel, hey, how's everything you need?

Love you, who is give make you love a girl you never touch it on

Nestling, what turned you into a little pinky racer

773
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,420
Stock cappuccino, with a mellow gauge taste

774
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,420
Oh, fang, fang, fang, fang

775
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,420

Coffee and refer, love that song

All right, everybody, that's enough for today

Today marks the beginning of a new era for music

00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,420
The way we'll be able to

00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,420
Share it amongst ourselves

789
