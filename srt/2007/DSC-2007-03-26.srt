1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,680
Hey buddy, hey buddy. Over here. Look, I got the genuine DSC 569 Dirt Cheap. No, no, it's

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,960
a real thing. Look, it's got the lighter clicks. It's got the all scruncher, a folder. It's

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,120
got the Trinityé–‹lights. It's got it all. Dirt Cheap, only $500. This left for this

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:31,760
stuff will cost you $3,000 in the market. Come on, what do you say? The DSC 569 Dirt Cheap.

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,240
Eh? Eh? Eh, you're not a cop, are you? Because if you are, you know, carry me,

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,040
me do this. Yeah, you add them. Carry, see you tomorrow.

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:11,320
The DSC 569 Dirt Cheap. No, no, no, no. I can see them, bring them down my neck. So many cameras.

8
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:30,520
I don't want to feel this way anymore. I can't remember how I felt before.

9
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,480
Dirt Cheap. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

10
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:30,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'll lose my life for you, I'll keep having you. I'll leave it, I'll do, I'll ending this game of action, no, night and shoot a

11
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,520
When I saw the rain, I'm crazy and so

12
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Breathe down my neck, suffocate me

13
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Breathe in my heart, you'll be the jack of me

14
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Deep down my stomach, you'll be the jack of me

15
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:33,520
Breathe in my heart, you'll be the jack of me

16
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,520
I'm crazy and so deep, you'll be the jack of me

17
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Breathe in my heart, you'll be the jack of me

18
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Breathe in my heart, you'll be the jack of me

19
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Breathe in my heart, you'll be the jack of me

20
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,520
As more of California's solace

21
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,520
I'm sorry Mishra that Carlinah

22
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,520
but North Carlinah no less

23
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,520
Most excellent classic case, in into nightmare I want to think

24
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,560
Latino fella for suggesting that to start off the daily source code.

25
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Hey, everybody.

26
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,440
It's a daily source code.

27
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
What is it?

28
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
Five, six, nine are already.

29
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,240
Today is beautiful in the UK.

30
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,520
I'm a little bit bummed out because I could have had the Delta

31
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,600
Sierra, my aircraft delivered to me after its annual inspection over

32
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,640
the weekend on Saturday, exactly.

33
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,040
And the week commander called me up and said,

34
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,800
yeah, he didn't bring it over and Captain Dan was unavailable.

35
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,400
And he said, well, you can always fly yourself across the channel.

36
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,880
And I looked at the weather reports and I looked like it was going to be

37
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,160
about a thousand foot cloud ceiling.

38
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,800
And my minimum is 1500.

39
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
For pilot experience is Captain Dan a thousand feet would be okay.

40
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,800
So I said, fuck, I'm not going to do it.

41
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,760
And now, of course, here's a beautiful day.

42
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,480
And it's supposed to be really nice all this week.

43
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,960
It may get a little bit rainy around Wednesday in the UK.

44
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,880
I've been thinking about providing weather reports to the UK.

45
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,400
I'm getting pretty good at this stuff.

46
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,320
And now that I have understand how to decipher and decode and aggregate all

47
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,040
the meteorological data.

48
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,800
So instead, in lieu of that, I had a configuration weekend.

49
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, yeah, I decided to tackle a couple of things that I had on my list for a while.

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,200
The first was to fix the internet here.

51
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,280
So I called up my provider and said, look, connection sucks.

52
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,480
I think it's this router.

53
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,600
And it took me a while to understand, for her to understand me and for me to

54
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,800
understand her, that they don't actually sell routers.

55
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,680
They send you one when you get the service.

56
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,560
But if you want to buy an additional one, you go to any store and you buy one, which kind

57
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
of makes sense.

58
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,360
And it's really it's an ADSL mode of slash router, slash access point or whatever.

59
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,440
I don't need the access point, portion of it, because I'm quite happy with my Apple airport

60
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,040
network, which is running on WDS.

61
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,320
I know it slows down traffic a little bit, but still, it's fine.

62
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,920
So she said, you know, we support was an action tech and linksis, I think, which I

63
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,520
have neither, of course, except for the, I think broken one, or I thought at the time broken

64
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
one.

65
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,120
And so I'm like, let me see if these airports are compatible and apparently they're

66
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:25,840
not because you need a PPP over A and they only have PPP over E except after C.

67
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,840
And, yeah, so I, so I was just noodling around in the airport to configuration.

68
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,000
And I noticed something rather interesting.

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,160
And it kind of took me back to what I'd tried to set up in the condo, because essentially

70
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:46,280
I just took my existing airport networks, I just plugged them into the router for the service.

71
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,520
And it was just kind of working, although I must say a lot of the computers seem to disconnect

72
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,160
and reconnect to the network a lot.

73
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,200
And it dawned on me that what I had done inadvertently is I, so the original, the action

74
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,440
tech modem that the ISP sent me is plugged into the ADSL of the phone jack.

75
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:11,160
And it provides IP addresses in the 192.168.1.xxx range.

76
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,720
And I just plugged the, the airports into one of its ethernet ports.

77
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:25,800
And they start providing their own address space in the 192.168.0.xxx range.

78
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,240
And I remember that something with the subnet's, if they're set to 255.255.255.0 is an

79
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,120
example that that kind of crosses over and can create conflicts.

80
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,520
And so I went about resetting the, the Apple airports so that they just passed through

81
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,000
as a bridge and we're not providing IP addresses.

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:53,520
And voila, duh, oh man, I can't believe I've been using that crappy messed up packet collision

83
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,560
configuration for so long when I could have fixed it, the fix was at my fingertips for,

84
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
for what?

85
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,960
Two months now.

86
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,760
So that's pretty much fixed.

87
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,880
That more, I still think I need to get a new router, just a better router because

88
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,320
it seems like it's, it has its quirks.

89
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,880
And you know, maybe like, so you have to flush out memory or something.

90
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,040
So the next step, of course, was going to be to upgrade the firmware.

91
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,480
I skipped that step over the weekend, figuring out, I'm happy that the shit is just working

92
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
now.

93
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,840
Let me have that settled down.

94
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,840
And now that I had a good connection, I went about to reflash my portable devices.

95
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Have you ever done this?

96
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
Have you ever reflashed your Nokia phone?

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,280
In other words, putting the new, the new system upgrade onto it, the new firmware.

98
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,400
It actually started with me reflashing my Nokia N800 Internet tablet, which was an okay

99
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
experience.

100
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,680
It's certainly not a consumer experience because you have to manually reinstall applications

101
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,080
that don't come baked in standard.

102
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Didn't really like that.

103
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,520
Oh, I have to say, I kind of did like it because it becomes such a development box for

104
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,520
me that there's a whole bunch of mess running, you know, stuff running that probably shouldn't

105
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,840
have been running and may have been affecting different parts of the system.

106
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:12,520
I must say, though, that I think I've noticed that the battery has changed its behavior.

107
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm not getting much more than about, well, I don't know, maybe my usage has changed,

108
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,120
but certainly the battery indicator, that has changed or it isn't right yet because I'll

109
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,480
be using thing for a couple hours and I pretty have a usage and it'll show a full battery

110
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,360
and then I can stop using it for like 15 minutes, click the screen and then I'll see

111
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,960
the battery indicator has dropped down to half.

112
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,840
So it's not really giving me, it may be lasting as long as it did under the circumstances

113
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,600
of usage, but the indicator certainly isn't making me time my work very well.

114
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,240
All of a sudden, well, we're getting low now and then you literally have like 30 minutes or

115
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,240
something.

116
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
There's the coolest thing.

117
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:04,520
I upgraded the symbion software on my Nokia, was the E61, which has Wi-Fi built right

118
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,920
into the cell phone and I always knew that it had the capability to set it up with the

119
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,600
CIP protocol as an internet phone and that it actually integrates completely with your

120
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,800
address book, but I was never able to load anything onto it or to get the configuration

121
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,200
just right.

122
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,960
And after flashing the device, I went to gizmoproject.com and I got the, it's like the N80 series

123
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,720
I think, but it's for Symbian, I installed it and presto all of a sudden now I have

124
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,480
a void phone and a cell phone in one device and it has a lot of really smart features.

125
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,960
When it sees a network that you've used before, it will automatically connect and be ready

126
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:51,000
to receive incoming calls and make outgoing calls, it, it, it, it knows to automatically

127
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,760
connect when it sees any type of network in general.

128
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,560
I mean, it's all kinds of cool things, so that it actually, hello and behold, just

129
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:06,960
might work as a, well, like a really cheap phone, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip,

130
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:14,280
comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, well

131
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:20,280
something else happened over the weekend, which almost passed me by unnoticed, luckily,

132
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,120
he's here, our European correspondent.

133
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Hello, I'm Gary.

134
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:33,240
Here's your European Union correspondent, a guy who is the link at www.comicstripbloc.com.

135
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:42,960
So yesterday, European Union, it means you, it was celebrating 50 birthday, well, I wanted

136
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:53,080
to say, happy birthday, you, and fuck you, yes, still, several EU countries are racist and

137
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:00,200
are blocking freedom of movement of workers, and like them, French, Feroque, iters, and Dutch

138
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
podcasts.

139
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:10,000
And generally, Europe is an ancient civilization, an museum, museum that is slowly dying,

140
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,720
over-taking by East Asia and USA, on generally by Asia.

141
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:25,720
And peace in Europe, in late 62 years, was due to USA and NATO, not due to EU itself, but

142
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,760
of course, bastards take care of it for everything.

143
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,040
So Adam, maybe, tell me, what do you think?

144
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:41,160
You'll survive next 50 years, so that 100 anniversary of you will be once celebrated.

145
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:49,000
You, coming straight blogger, yes indeed, the European Union celebrated its 50th birthday

146
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,040
on, was that Sunday yesterday, and of course, this 50 years after the treaty of Rome,

147
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,360
I believe, in which the member states formed the union.

148
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:14,800
And if you recall what do you call it, not the proposal, God, I'm spacing on it anyway.

149
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,880
The ratification, there you go, the ratification of the constitution, the European Union

150
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:26,760
constitution, did not take place as the Netherlands and France both said no to the ratification.

151
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,400
So now things are kind of spinning up, we've got a new president coming in.

152
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:41,120
As the presidency is handed over, there's a possibility of trying to get the ratification

153
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,880
of the constitution done in 2008 or 2009, I think.

154
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:52,800
First of all, whoever's doing PR for the European Union sucks ass.

155
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,040
First birthday, kind of, crept up on me, it was there, you know, where was all the pre-promotion?

156
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,840
Where were all the, excuse me, sir, a perfect time to mention that I just love the new

157
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Folgers flavor brands, again, if you combine the width of splendor, with that flavored splendor,

158
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:15,680
you've got a yummy treat, yeah, where were all the, where was all the setup for it?

159
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,760
All of a sudden, there was like, you know, I saw classical concert and then some concert

160
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:28,760
somewhere else and Ron and Chris and Marta and they were all in Berlin just recently and they

161
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,800
didn't mention anything to me, I don't know, it just sounds kind of weird that all of a sudden

162
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,360
whoops, there we are, we're 50.

163
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,640
I think in general, it's a really good idea to have a European Union, the only way you can

164
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,480
look at the Netherlands as an example, very, very, very small country.

165
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:52,200
Now about 16, 17 million inhabitants, a closed off language, they speak Dutch, of course,

166
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,280
just by everyone speaks fluent English, which is a very important part of their survival

167
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:03,040
and a very, very strong financial infrastructure that provides a lot of financial infrastructure

168
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:11,080
to the rest of the world in tax shelters, tax shelters is really the best thing that I can

169
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,040
say, a tax shelter, and of course, a very powerful bank, A.B. and Amro, which seems to

170
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,440
be coming less powerful every day, without that, they would have been overrun, I think

171
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,720
a long time ago and really, you can see the makeup of the population, I saw a change

172
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,040
in a span of about eight years when we lived there a couple of years ago and I hadn't

173
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:37,720
been there for eight years, you could really see the change up in the population composition

174
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,480
if you will. And that's happening all over Europe, and I truly believe that there only

175
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,280
if you can, well, really, I think the UK doesn't feel like they're part of, like they're

176
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,800
part of Europe, it doesn't feel that way, and of course, it's all about the monetary

177
00:15:51,800 --> 00:16:00,680
position. The UK itself has a very strong financial position in the global marketplace,

178
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,880
but by not using the euro, they're kind of excluding themselves. So if you do look at the

179
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,520
United States, which is more or less to say, it's kind of the model on what the EU, I guess

180
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:17,080
is based on, except the this whole thing about the constitution is very weird. There's a

181
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,160
lot of stuff on the constitution, which just doesn't make sense as a constitutional document,

182
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,560
if you compare it to the declaration of independent to the own US constitution. So there's

183
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,880
some things that need to be fixed there, but the idea of using of having interstate commerce,

184
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,080
if you will, and arranging a lot of things to make it flow easily, and still being able to have

185
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:44,920
independent state laws, look at the difference in laws, in the marijuana drug laws, in California,

186
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:54,120
very different than they are in, say, New York. So, you know, it is possible to live in harmony

187
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,160
as member states in the union with some very significant differences at a local level. So it's

188
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,240
important, and if you want to be able to not be overrun, indeed, by the West or the East,

189
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:13,640
and become either Asian or American, then you have to join together. So it makes a lot of sense,

190
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,760
and historically Europe has been able to do that. So yeah, I'm actually all for it, but indeed,

191
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,200
you know, everyone does have to kind of join in, and I think the most important thing

192
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,400
is this crossing the borders to work in different states. That is very important.

193
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Now, I don't know if Hawaii, as an example, has any different regulations than the Continental

194
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,400
US, because that would be kind of a way to compare it, because in Ireland, there's only so many

195
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,800
people that can fit on an island. And in a state, it's a little different, because if you run out of

196
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:52,200
state, you just fill out, you know, you spill out into the other states. So, but yeah, I'm following this.

197
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,560
It's very interesting to me. And sometimes I read the, I read a newspaper every single day,

198
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,160
the Financial Times, and you know, just look at this. I'm going to like, wow, man,

199
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:08,280
sometimes it looks so archaic, and so almost medieval in the way things are discussed and

200
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,520
and the approach that's taken, but yeah, change often takes a long time.

201
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:23,000
On April 2nd, the cell cancer of ANGB will present a special one-hour feature on Karma Koda,

202
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,040
the award-winning independent electronic adeo, a redcrocker, and had their peers.

203
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,320
I'll never forget one of our first shows. There were some Japanese tourists who had actually heard

204
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,520
the music on mp3.com and showed up at one of our shows, and they somehow got their self-decephensisco

205
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,920
and, you know, science CDs, and we kind of knew that we were on to something special.

206
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:49,880
I'm seeing Swan as the opening credits for the film Neverland was just like, it just confirmed

207
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,000
everything that we were thinking. You know, it's a whole revolution. The last 10 years, you know,

208
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,640
everything is different in business, and it's completely made Karma Koda, Karma Koda.

209
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,680
It'll be previewing a brand new album illuminate, as well as the other three CDs,

210
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,800
and this in-depth look at one of the most successful indie bands online on the chill cast.

211
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,120
Check it out at ANGB.com.

212
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,120
That's B with a W.

213
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,800
Mark Yoshimode Namcoff sent me the final tally since what came in over the weekend,

214
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,320
in our bum rush, the charts campaign. I'm very impressed, particularly with the international

215
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:32,280
participation. I'm very, very interesting. Of course, you'd expect the actual iTunes market

216
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:40,440
place to be smaller, therefore, um, shit. I don't know. Maybe it's more active audiences.

217
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,400
That's also very possible. I don't know how to interpret the data, but

218
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,760
looking at the iTunes music chart across the board, our bum rush, the charts, a campaign that lasted

219
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,200
for one day, the result, and I'm sure it's spilled over into a couple more, resulted in the song

220
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,280
mine again from Black Lab, reaching the U.S. Rock charted iTunes position number 11 in Canada,

221
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,360
number 10. In the USA, we did break the top 100. Overall, that means across all genres coming

222
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:14,840
in at 99. So, made the new move, as I said on Friday, 53 in Canada, that's the overall chart.

223
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,800
That's half, you know, almost halfway up the chart in the Netherlands. Rock chart number two,

224
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:27,800
Sweden, number seven, Germany, number 12. Wow. Great job, mine of Hoina. Number 73 overall in

225
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,640
Germany in Holland, number 15 on the top 100 overall chart. That means the, with all genres,

226
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:41,240
Norway, 55, 10 on the rock chart in Norway, 42 in Switzerland on the rock chart, Sweden, 95 in the

227
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,760
top 100 of all genres, Portugal, 31 on the rock chart, Australia, 35 on the rock chart, UK,

228
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,080
71 on the rock, Italy, number 30, Finland, 42 on the rock chart, Denmark, number 40, Ireland,

229
00:20:53,080 --> 00:21:00,040
54, New Zealand, 54, Austria, number 15 on the rock chart. That's unbelievable. There were over 16,

230
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,600
clicks on the buy now page at bumrush. The charts dot com. So, of course, our tally doesn't

231
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:13,400
include the people who bought the songs directly from iTunes or put their own links on,

232
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,600
but one thing's for sure. Some kids going to go to college because of this. That's the cool

233
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,640
part. I've been I'm so impressed. I, it's unbelievable. Of course, you know, I've seen some

234
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,680
articles over the weekend saying, oh, well, they didn't make it to number. What cares if we made

235
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,440
it to number one? Look what we did in one day. And as I said, the international participation

236
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,600
was just outstanding. And I must say somewhat unexpected. Hey, Adam, this is Alexander calling

237
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:48,440
from Stockholm. I bumrushed all over the place yesterday. And I am wondering where to send my

238
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,000
receipt. I think to remember that you last week said that we were supposed to send you emailed

239
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,040
the receipt to you. And there would be a contest. We would win valuable prizes. And was it

240
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:09,320
saved the world? Bye. Folder. Yo. Folder? Yeah, actually, it wasn't my contest, but I was involved

241
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,960
in the contest. So you send the receipt to Adam at podshow.com and I'll forward them off and

242
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:22,600
make sure that that that gets tied up. I didn't want to provide any personal incentive. But it did

243
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,600
happen. So I can't remember exactly who said that. I'm sorry. I'm spacing for a second. But I'll

244
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:35,560
forward it to him. So then we can, uh, can wind that one up from Stockholm down under.

245
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,160
I heard I'm David from Perth calling you. And you're doing, mate, just putting you know,

246
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,600
do the bumrushed the charts thing, purchase black labs. So, um, I have to say I grew

247
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,880
at WFN. It's not really biting, but I know what the hell it's for a good cause. So, one,

248
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,880
can you take us up David this time? How we all went on that? Thanks, mate. How did you been

249
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,840
telling me? Well, we'll talk to you soon. See you, mate. Folder? Yeah, you really should

250
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,680
congratulate yourselves as, uh, as an, as an audience that made its voice heard. Believe me,

251
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:13,400
that this was watched. And particularly these rock charts, statistics are very, very interesting.

252
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,000
If you know how much money it takes to get a song onto the charts, it's, it's incredibly

253
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,200
difficult. This shows that, you know, right now, if we put all of our collective audiences together

254
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,080
in the same boat, we're making some big difference. But it won't be too long before one show can

255
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,120
have this type of power to move the needle on almost, well, almost anything. And of course,

256
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,880
the, the perfect place to start is with the Podsake music network. Hey Adam, this is the

257
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,360
path man from the Rockout Lab podcast down under in Australia. In a bit of a follow-up to

258
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,000
bun rush the charts and the promotional power that Pod casting can have, I've got a quick story

259
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,920
for you. You're recently played a band called One Day Remains from South Africa,

260
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,200
on Fubar Friday, episode 5-6-8. I actually discovered this band almost a week ago through

261
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,600
my space bought and I emailed the band to get permission to use one of their songs on our own

262
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,480
podcast, Rockout Loud, which the band responded to quite positively and sent us a track the very

263
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,200
next day. We then featured their song in episode 9, which really leased on the 15th of March.

264
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,000
But since then, some more interesting developments have happened.

265
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,600
Oh, hold on, I'm going to stop you there for one second because I've got to say goodbye to the

266
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,720
serious satellite radio listeners. You're going to continue throughout our block of the Pod Show on

267
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,280
and if anyone else is interested to look at those shows that are on the serious network,

268
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:33,000
look at serious S-I-R-I-U-S dot Pod Show dot com. The hearing themselves on our podcast,

269
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,880
one day Remains got back to us very excited and said, guys, how do we get our band promoted more

270
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,880
through this thing called Pod casting? And my response to them was, well, you've got to get

271
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,320
you music on the PMN because that's okay. Now listen independent artists, listen mainstream

272
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:53,160
record labels, listen to what he's saying, listen to how this works. I got the song from

273
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,280
Sir Jersey Todd, who of course is my official musicologist on the Charlie. And he sent it to me

274
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:06,040
pre-package, you know, and I take his advice, hands down, no questions asked, whatever Jersey

275
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,560
Todd sends me, I will play, at least on Fridays. If he starts sending me stuff every single day of

276
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,040
the week, I'm going to start making choices. But on Fridays, it's his slot. He fills it up.

277
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:22,120
I trust him to do the right thing and get the right tracks in there. And even if I don't agree

278
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,520
with it sometimes, I still trust him because I think he's got that knack. I have to say, I don't

279
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,520
think there's been a single time that I didn't like the track that he sent. So you see how this,

280
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,400
this is a whole backstory. I didn't even know about this. That's fascinating. Well, not only

281
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,200
we can play a music, but other podcasts as World Wide will have access to your music and be

282
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,640
able to play and promote your band. So they did just that. They uploaded four tracks to the PMN.

283
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,400
So really, I mean, the power of podcasting and also the PMN, I just really want to push the

284
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,520
value of that and we go out to gigs all the time and we're just talking to bands and trying to,

285
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,640
I guess almost educate them about this whole new media and digital world that they can access and

286
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,520
promote their music through. But this is just one example of how a band and under a week has

287
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:12,040
gone to an Australian podcast has then been found by Jersey Todd in America, which here's then

288
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:17,640
40 to you in the UK and London. So around the world in a week. So I think that's pretty cool.

289
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,080
Anyway, so I just thought I'd drop you a quick line and let you know what was happening.

290
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,480
Thanks for that, Adam. Catch you later. All right, man. Folder. Yeah. Thank you.

291
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,080
Absolutely. So you didn't know that it's got to Jersey,

292
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:40,840
turned that Jersey Jersey, turned. Sorry, man. Jersey Todd. Mark sent me an email.

293
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,680
Four words, subject line. The bum rush idle podcast, which is actually five words, you idiot.

294
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,840
There is, there is some type of competition type thing we can put in here that would be fun.

295
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:03,160
I think the key to it is probably using the iTunes chart as some kind of metric. Interesting.

296
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,040
I've got to think about that. But that could be very, it wouldn't be interesting if you voted

297
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:15,880
by buying the song. Gee, what a concept. It's like the reverse idle almost. You know, with

298
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,320
American idle or any of the idle formats around the world, you got to sing your ass off,

299
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:30,200
doing covers. And then you'll get a record contract because of votes. And this would be,

300
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,160
I'm just ideating here. And this would be buying the song translating into votes.

301
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,880
Of course, it's got to be enough to make a difference. But hey, I know we could do. We could ask,

302
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,520
yeah, I got an idea. Ah, see, I got an idea. I got all excited. I started moving around,

303
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,440
banging into the furniture. What if we asked iTunes to put a chart together for us?

304
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,440
Of some specific songs? I could be fun. And we'd have to make it open ended so that anything,

305
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:05,240
oh, yeah, I'm liking it now. If we made it open ended so that any song could make it in, any song

306
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:11,160
could be nominated by purchases, not by votes, with by purchases. In effect, we could create

307
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,640
anyone could create their own bum rush. Oh, fuck it. Okay, I'm going to talk to the apple guys.

308
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,080
Oh, so that sounds like a really good idea. Oh, I'm an exciting idea.

309
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,360
And the only people who make out are the artists. Yeah, awesome. Well, I'm sorry.

310
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,840
I think it, um, okay, so we should probably, all right, I got to think about this. You already

311
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,120
here. I'm getting diarrhea of the mouth. More about, um, I've told you about this guy, Nigel,

312
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,040
who keeps bringing fantastic artists onto the network. And I said last week, I don't know if this

313
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,560
guy is a, um, a record promoter or what he does. If he, if he, these artists that he's promoting

314
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,440
are actually on his label, but just like the story you heard about, you know, how was song travel

315
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,640
around the world in six days? You know, it's very simple, very simple. Hello,

316
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,240
independent record promoters who are now out of business or on their way to jail. Here is a

317
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:11,080
way to make the same thing happen. Hi, Adam. It's Nigel here from MattBounceyDogs.com,

318
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,520
but you probably know me better as Nigel from podcast live. I heard you're using me as an example

319
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,880
of an independent promoter and just to set the record straight, I'm really not Thomas Dobby's

320
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,920
record company or actually any artist's record company for that matter. But I do promote music to

321
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,680
podcasters and not just any music. I turned down about three or four artists a week who sent me

322
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,960
rehearsals and tapes, you know, they, they, the sort of thing that they're record on their mobile

323
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,800
phones, however, they're not all that bad. Some of the artists that got through are the young

324
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,240
punks. Leave what you're in.

325
00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:00,440
Sarah Macbatch. I say I don't care and have just to get my back from clear.

326
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,760
And the hits just keep on coming.

327
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Nigel's new Nigel's hit collection.

328
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,840
And of course Howard Jones.

329
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,920
You know, all I do is send out a mail when I put a new truck from the PMN to anybody who wants to receive it.

330
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,400
And I know you already on the list, so there's no point in me telling you that all you've got to do is

331
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,560
stop me online at Nigel and MattBounceDogs.com. And I'll add you to it.

332
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,600
Oh, by the way, I've got some really great stuff coming out in the next game month. I used to watch out for my mail.

333
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,920
You tease. See you. Hold her. I think.

334
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,680
So that's Nigel. Doesn't it sound like he has got his own little hit collection going on there.

335
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,280
I think about the involvement that he has with with this with this it is it. I have to say it's

336
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,520
a movement. I keep reminding myself how incredibly freaking cool. Oh, hold on a second.

337
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:24,280
Tom's hooting just sent me a Skype DSC cover art. I'll let's take a look, shall we? Hold on.

338
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,840
I'll just download it. It'll open up the Skype channel so you can hear it when it's done because it

339
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,080
gives that nice little Skype from from from. Oh, my, here it comes. It's nice and fast now on my yeah.

340
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:42,600
There we go. Okay, open it up. Let me see. Oh, cool, man. Awesome. I'll put it in today's

341
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:49,000
a today's art. There we go. Sorry about that. Yeah. So that's Nigel.

342
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:56,120
And as I was saying, I sometimes I just forget how incredibly cool the positive music network is.

343
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,920
I mean, it truly is a social media network and it really does work as you can tell.

344
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:09,400
And I received an email. When did this come in 14 hours ago? So that was last night sometime. Hi Adam.

345
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,120
This is from Sandy Shaw. Now, I played the song. The puppets got a brand new string, which of course

346
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,760
is the new version of puppet on a string. As she owns all of her own material. She is a pod

347
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:32,120
safe artist, almost by definition. Hi Adam. Someone sent me a copy of your last show and I was on it.

348
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,480
How amazing. I'm really happy to join the media revolution. I'm so tired of the marketing and

349
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,360
promotion mechanics that is nowadays called the music industry. I started to sing in the 60s

350
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,920
because I wanted to be a musician. I wanted to see and change the world, not be a performing

351
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,360
The reason I'm jumping back on board now is that I can do it without corporate interference.

352
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:58,600
I can relate to my audience directly. I feel comfortable with this. It's so 60s, so Smith,

353
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,920
so Sandy. I feel I really feel part of a changing society. Cool is a state of mind. Love,

354
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:13,720
Sandy Shaw, XXX. Oh. This is awesome. I grew up listening to Sandy Shaw. Now she's joining the

355
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,520
revolution by her own words. P.S. You do know that bum rush in the UK has slightly

356
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:28,520
naughty implications. Now that's that's awesome, Sandy. I'd like you to let's hook up and maybe

357
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:36,200
you can explain it to me. Although I have some ideas. Oh man, I love it. I love it. This is

358
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,920
and by the way, says someone sent me a copy. I presume that's that's Nigel.

359
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:47,160
So hopefully we'll be hearing more from Sandy Shaw. And more artists like her, young old,

360
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,400
back catalog, new catalog, who cares. It's right there. It's yours for the taking. It works.

361
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,800
And let me work on this this bum rush thing. This bum rush idol. We can't use the word idol.

362
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,440
I've got to think of a different one. But it has to be apparent. And it won't be a reality show.

363
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,120
It'll be the reality of real time what people really think about songs and how they really get

364
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:21,080
behind it. To the question that was raised last week, who does the Pacho tags in the UK?

365
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:27,800
It's Philip E Collins. I'll put a link in the show notes. We got her from voiceovers.co.uk,

366
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:33,560
which is just the place where people put up auditions for their voice. And I like that system.

367
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,440
Philip E Collins, who does it? Thanks Brian. No for jumping in on that thread.

368
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,480
And the guy who always does a fantastic opening for the Charlie. At least he's been doing it for the

369
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,080
past. I don't know. 30 episodes. It seems like his PD love. And it's always nice when he sends

370
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,720
in something that is for his own benefit. Hey Adam, you were talking about milestones the other

371
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,920
day. And you were talking about whether or not to show 100 is really still a milestone. And so forth.

372
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,720
And just kind of debating that. Well in my mind, a milestone or at least something that elevates

373
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,320
your podcast to the next level is an official Jeff Smith jingle. Well what of my shows,

374
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,320
the daddy cast, has now risen to that level. Take a listen.

375
00:35:33,720 --> 00:36:03,720
Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good

376
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good

377
00:36:33,720 --> 00:37:03,720
Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

378
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:24,720
And that would be a part of the package that you get when joining. And I think it'll be a pretty cool idea. If you want to contact Jeff directly, it's TheJefSmith.com and Jeff is spelled G-E-O-F-F. Where the heck did that come from? By the way, who made that shit up? I guess it's from Jeffery. Yeah, shit. Okay. Makes sense.

379
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Hey, Adam. How are you? It's Pablo from Ecuador again. Hey, Pablo. I'm calling you because I just hear your podcast where you work on people, how to use their cell phones. Just to give you a little bit about how it works on phrases.

380
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Okay. Now, this is really important. You pay attention because I'm going to explain something to Pablo. That pertains to everyone using a mobile phone because it really does work, even though he gets a little bit confused.

381
00:37:52,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Check it out. I found that crap because I used my cell phone. And in order to dial to your phone number, I used first the country code in this case it's 01.

382
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Okay. Stop right there, Pablo. That's the point. The O-O. That is not the country code. One is the country code. So for the UK, it's 04. So instead of typing the O-O, which by the way, in the United States,

383
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:29,720
you have to dial 011 and then the country code. That's really the only reason for the plus because these days,

384
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,720
O-O works in just about every single country except for the United States.

385
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:51,720
So the plus sign does not work for some of us. You have to dial first the country code. That's it. So, how do you later? Bye.

386
00:38:51,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Pablo, thank you, man. Yeah, okay. So we already gave out the US number. So either it's 0044 or it's plus 44 for this number.

387
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,720
I just got a couple more voice mail messages that I want to play for you. This one is about the cost of receiving SMSes.

388
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Hey Adam, it's CJ for a user. I just want to give you one little feedback on the GSM. You'd never pay for receiving an SMS while roaming.

389
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,720
Apart from, of course, the paying SMS services where you send one to pay.

390
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:47,720
Okay. Now I got a fundamentally disagree with this. When you are roaming in a different country and SMS text message, you pay for when it comes in.

391
00:39:48,720 --> 00:40:00,720
In some cases, it can be as high as, you know, a dollar per message. The same with phone calls, by the way, where you may pay nothing for incoming phone calls in your particular region.

392
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,720
When you travel outside of that region, you better believe your pain and ex amount per minute.

393
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:17,720
And then you get like 20 back at 50 cents each. But apart from that, you only might have to pay a surplus when you're roaming and sending.

394
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:25,720
So that's all the GSM part. And let me know how you get on with your GSM project and your avoid stuff.

395
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:32,720
And by the way, can you do me a favor? It looks and see if you can get me an N.800 as a previous sample for a site.

396
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Yeah, right. Oh, not really kidding. Actually, but you better know. All right, have a good weekend fight.

397
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:48,720
Yeah, I do find it very fascinating. All these different ways of connecting and creating voice calls. And it's really the device is, and I have to say, I think Nokia is,

398
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:55,720
God, I got to get those people to pay me money for saying some of this.

399
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,720
That's it. We should this should be a way to like reverse advertising. Wouldn't that be a great way to do advertising?

400
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:09,720
Just talk about the shit you like and then afterwards, you know, you go to the advertising and say, no, pay me.

401
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Yeah, they've got their shit together though. When it comes to this E61, I think it's really, really, really smart. You know I'm going to use it.

402
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,720
And it's not about the money per say it's more about like fuck you. I don't need you. I can do this with my own connection here.

403
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:30,720
I pay for connections at work. I pay for connections at home. I have Wi-Fi connections all over London.

404
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,720
So I'm going to, you know, I'm going to be my own phone service. I'm going to turn my own prices. And it's not quite as convenient yet.

405
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:46,720
But I don't usually, when I find myself out on the road and not in the proximity of a Wi-Fi hotspot.

406
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Yeah, okay. I'm, I'm happy to use the cellular network. Nothing wrong with it.

407
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,720
But otherwise, I can do all this stuff myself. And I like it that it's on one device. That's what really makes a lot of sense.

408
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,720
Hey Adam, this is full from Memphis, Tennessee.

409
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:09,720
Um, originally Nigerian. So that's okay. From Nigeria. Well, I think I received several emails from you.

410
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:16,720
That explains the actions. I got two things. The first thing you've probably heard before is, uh,

411
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,720
Do you think it's a coincidence that the name Adam or the father of all mankind?

412
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,720
And then, uh, you Adam are the, uh, fathers, uh, podcasting.

413
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,720
Um, uh, kind of strange coincidence.

414
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,720
Well, I think, uh, I don't, I'm not the father of podcasting, but, um,

415
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,720
Uh, I think we're all put on this earth to do something to achieve something.

416
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:46,720
And maybe, uh, my role is to change media, or at least contribute to it.

417
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,720
The second thing is, um, how come you only take phone calls from the people that are, uh,

418
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,720
regular, uh, regular calls of the show? That's not true.

419
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,720
It's the regular callers of the ones who actually send in phone calls that are useful.

420
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,720
That's why a lot of phone calls are so long and so boring and just, you know,

421
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,720
And I'm not, I'm not going to edit phone calls or the topic is just not interesting or, or the,

422
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,720
or the topic is pretty much over and close. Um, so you find out that the, the people who get on the air

423
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,720
come regular is because they're sending in comments in a format that I find usable as no other reason for that.

424
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,720
Um, I think you should take, uh, phone calls from other people, you know,

425
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,720
Yeah, yeah, I think you play other people like mine who,

426
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,720
Another thing that bugs me is phone calls that start off with, hey, I'm so and so from the so and so podcast,

427
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,720
I'm really more interested in listeners.

428
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,720
So more, you know, just gives us a why the audience to listen to.

429
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
All right, Adam.

430
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
All right, I have a podcast also.

431
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,720
It's called people wearing O show F O L A R I N and O separately.

432
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,720
Show.

433
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,720
All right.

434
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,720
All right.

435
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Now you wonder why I don't play all the boys' meal comments.

436
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
One more song for today before I get out.

437
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,720
Uh, Ed Ovet sent me this amazing.

438
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,720
This is a fantastic song.

439
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,720
Hey, Adam, it's a late Saturday afternoon.

440
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,720
I'm surfing around the March 24th new podcast music network uploads.

441
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,720
And lo and behold, look who I found none other than the boss himself Bruce Springsteen,

442
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,720
harmonizing on vocals on the following track.

443
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,720
I think you'll like it.

444
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,720
Jesse Malen, broken radio.

445
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:38,720
I was thinking about another time still in my mind.

446
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:47,720
Well, I used to know a little girl how this world.

447
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:54,720
You wave out loves you more than you know.

448
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,720
Breezed on rivalry and rock and roll.

449
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:12,720
No one's ever more to sit there so she lets go on a radio.

450
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:20,720
Well, we never had a lot of cash, but we love those kids.

451
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,720
So I'm saying that she missed the book.

452
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,720
She just blew the bridge.

453
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:36,720
The angels of him are the new known.

454
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:44,720
Breezed on rivalry and rock and roll.

455
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:57,720
No one's ever more to sit there so she takes on a radio.

456
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:04,720
Still making it so dead.

457
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:12,720
In books we never left.

458
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,720
Love all the soul and Sunday.

459
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,720
We might read again.

460
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,720
She used to talk about astrology.

461
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,720
She was morning June.

462
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:36,720
She dance with strangers and celebrities and distorting the full moon.

463
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:43,720
I was thinking about the universe from what it's worth.

464
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:52,720
All the one on that the Phoenix bird, the tide and return.

465
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:59,720
The angels of him are the new known.

466
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:07,720
Breezed on rivalry and rock and roll.

467
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:15,720
No one's ever more to sit there so she takes on a radio.

468
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:22,720
No one's ever more to sit there so she takes on a radio.

469
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:29,720
Sometimes I see him a place when there's no more place to go.

470
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,720
I'm a radio.

471
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,720
I'm a radio.

472
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,720
I'm a radio.

473
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,720
I'm a radio.

474
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,720
I'm a radio.

475
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,720
That was right.

476
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,720
It's busted.

477
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,720
It's crap.

478
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,720
It's broken radio.

479
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,720
Jessie Manland with guest vocals from Bruce Springsteen.

480
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,720
You can find him with the pod safe music network.

481
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,720
The album is called Glitter in the gutter and he's from New York.

482
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,720
Awesome.

483
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,720
All right.

484
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,720
Everybody a little bit longer than I intended.

485
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,720
But of course it's Monday.

486
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,720
You know, got to catch up on all the stuff that happened over the weekend.

487
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,720
So we back tomorrow with another daily source code.

488
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,720
From the affluent suburb of Surrey.

489
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,720
You know, it's Gilford, G-town, Westside, represent.

490
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,720
How sad is that when a middle-aged white man talks like that.

491
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,720
Another pod show podcast.

492
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,720
Stick it in your ear.
