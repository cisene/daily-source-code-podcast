1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, and the next generation radio

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,120
content in my ears.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,840
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:32,280
Well, sorry, no good intro today, but wanted to pass along that, after you're done listening

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,280
to the DSC 535, you should go over to helpingthecause.com.

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,840
Team Bidious trying to raise $25,000 in the MS Walk in April, so as a good podcast listener

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,920
as a good podcast citizen, go over to helpingthecause.com, look for Team Biddy, and pledge

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
a little bit.

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,400
They can use all the help they can get in, they'll make it feel good.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,480
And now, somewhere in the curry quarters, above the curry kitchen where the curry cat is

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:20,480
on the curry counter, eating curry crackers, here's that.

12
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:35,480
So, we're going to go over to the next generation radio, we're going to go over to the next generation

13
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:46,480
radio, we're going to go over to the next generation radio, we're going to go over to the next generation

14
00:02:46,480 --> 00:03:08,960
radio, you know, I know I say this plenty of times, but you just don't hear enough

15
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
of it.

16
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,960
I'm going to go over to the next generation radio, we're going to go over to the next generation

17
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,200
radio, we're going to go over to the next generation radio, we're going to go over to the next

18
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,200
generation radio, we're going to go over to the next generation radio, we're going to go over

19
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:38,240
to the next generation radio, we're going to go over to the next generation radio, we're

20
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,920
going over to the next generation radio, we're going over to the next generation radio, we're

21
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,920
going over to the next generation radio, we're going over to the next generation radio, we're

22
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,920
going over to the next generation radio, we're going over to the next generation radio, we're

23
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,920
going over to the next generation radio, we're going over to the next generation radio,

24
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
we're going over to the next generation radio, we're going over to the next generation radio,

25
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,600
I got a couple of emails yesterday from people saying that they really hated the sound

26
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,320
of the setup here in the, well, we're still calling the cottage.

27
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,440
So I started to mess around with it, got into real trouble on the mixer, I mean, got

28
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,560
everything screwed up and I have no idea how it, I think I sound a little nasal, let me

29
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,000
see, how's everything set here, one, two, one, two, whatever.

30
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,240
Hi, this is Gilbert in Georgia, I was thinking about the name for a new place there, I'm sure

31
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,400
somebody must have suggested it, but maybe not, I don't know, why not curie kingdom, I mean,

32
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:50,800
it is a big grand, but then life is grand, anyway, just let I drop that in, enjoy

33
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,080
listening to the show, down here in the beach, so anyway, have a good day, see you later, bye.

34
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,880
All right, man, appreciate it. Okay, I think that I've decided that there are, you know,

35
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,200
there are a couple of names I like, I just want to get it over with already, and I think I'm

36
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,840
going to have to shy away from a literation, so we can't have a cook sound, although curie

37
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,480
kingdom is kind of nice, but if it's going to be a literation, I'd like it at least to be two seas,

38
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,240
I think the curie manner is sounding pretty good to me. I'm going to try it on, you're

39
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,720
going to do, I'm going to change the wireless access points to curie manner, see how it feels,

40
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,200
because it actually, it could sound good, it's like, from the curie manner, from the curie

41
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,200
manner on a hilltop, on the west side of G-town.

42
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,560
This music, on safe music live, featuring coat of funnick.

43
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,160
Matthew Ebel.

David McMillan.

Kevin Reeves.

46
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,040
Don't think I can make it on my own.

47
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:32,080
And Jeff Smith, I want it to be hell up in the sound seats, stuck in the middle of everywhere.

48
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,720
With special guests, C.C. Chapman from Accident Ash, on safe music live,

49
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,480
it all starts at 6 p.m. Tuesday that he wore a 20-bit edge hill studios at Nashville,

50
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,720
Tennessee.

For more information, visit accidenthash.com.

52
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,800
You know, that sounds like a damn good show. Gosh, I don't want now the,

53
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,160
I've got all kinds of ground loops in the studio. It's really weird. If I plug in the

54
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,560
printer, then all of a sudden I get a ground loop. If I put the, if I put the power book on top of the

55
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,080
TLA 55, was it 552 stereo valve processor, then I get some kind of other different like a

56
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,760
hard disk like ground loop sound. Ah, lots of stuff getting used. I'm going to really work on

57
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,840
the place today. I've got the, I've got the fireplace up here going, which is really nice. It's

58
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,640
a nice and toasty warm. I just got a start and unpacking some boxes. This morning, of course,

59
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,840
we were up bright and early in Antis, wow, it's my microphone really hot now, hot.

60
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,080
An anticipation of the, of the sky guy coming. Well, I'm just adjusting some stuff. I'm sorry

61
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,880
you have to bear with me through all this crap. Mind as well. Do it now. Okay. The sky guy was

62
00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:00,400
supposed to come. I've ordered the multi rooms sky view package, which includes two regular sky

63
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:11,200
plus digital boxes, and one HD, or is they saying the UK HD? So that one, so I don't have the

64
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,720
HD television yet. I was planning on maybe going out this afternoon and making that purchase.

65
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,560
So the sky guy shows up and he's, oh, okay. Great. Let's, let's get this going here.

66
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,600
And he says, wait a minute, you have three boxes. Yes, three boxes. Remember, this is the same

67
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,960
company that, you know, the guy said he couldn't find my house. This may be the same guy.

68
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,960
I actually have to ask him that. He's from Leeds. He's only been in this region for three weeks.

69
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,240
So that sounds like it probably wasn't a nice enough guy. And he looks up at the roof and he

70
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,120
sending says, okay. And then he looks at where the, where the phone access point is, which, of

71
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,600
course, is exactly on the other side of the house. And these sky boxes have to talk back to home based,

72
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,200
you know, basically upload all my information to home base. So they have to talk a

73
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,040
communicate via a telephone. He says, you know, this is, I have six more installs today on this

74
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,840
is a whole day job. I said, yeah, no shit. So, you know, we call up sky home base, phone home to Murdock.

75
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,400
And yeah, they say, well, if, if we can wait until tomorrow, then he can spend the whole day

76
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:20,400
on doing the install here. Okay. Exasperating, I tell you, hey, lots of feedback on Trinity.

77
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,960
We're really, uh, we're getting somewhere. We actually have something to look at, which I'll get

78
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:31,280
to later on in this very show. Yeah, good day. Adam, it's a Scott from Sydney, Australia. It's

79
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,760
kind of to say how much I enjoy your podcast. It's that sort of fantastic. I've been listening to

80
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,480
it for a bit of a very young app. And I listen to it every day in the health desk when I'm supposed

81
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,760
to be doing calls. And all the guys in the health desk also enjoy your podcast and they want

82
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,800
to say, he got the good work and, uh, chill out, man. So, yeah, there's a lot to it and, uh,

83
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,720
I talk to you saying. Hi. Adam, yeah. No, thanks, dude. I appreciate it. So, you're all sitting there at

84
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,520
the health desk when you're supposed to be, and what kind of health desk is it? Is it for a certain

85
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:09,760
product? Are you all just sitting there just goofing off doing, you know, nothing better to do at

86
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,600
all. Listen to the daily source code. Oh, I gotta get my ass down to Australia. I really

87
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,560
really, really, really want to go. Maybe, I don't know if it'll be this year. This year or next year,

88
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,920
we definitely have to get down there, uh, neither Patricia or Christina have ever seen Australia.

89
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,840
And I know that they would really love it. It's just, yeah, we gotta get someone to look after

90
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,600
the animals and look after the house and all that stuff. But, um, yeah, I would love to do that.

91
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
Just revisit some of the places I've been to before. And then go to some of the other spots that

92
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,200
I've never been to. I've never been of north, uh, the northern part of Australia. And I bet they

93
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,120
would love that.

94
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Common strip, common strip, common strip, common strip, common strip, common strip, common strip, common

95
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,520
strip, common strip, common strip, common strip. Now, I haven't listened to this comment that

96
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,520
comments were going to come through blogger sent in. Um, he's been on a rampage lately about,

97
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,920
uh, you know, this, this interview that I said I would do with him and he feels completely

98
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,880
slided that I've said I don't really want to meet him in person. So I'm thinking, I just get my schedule

99
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,200
together. I get my schedule together for the next week and a half. Because, you know, third week of

100
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,320
February, I'm back to the States again. This is my new regime. And I'm just going to tell them

101
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,520
when I'm going to be in London and when I'm available. Let's see what he has to say today.

102
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,400
Hi, Adam Curry. I think interview with you. Sorry, man. But you promised me. So yeah,

103
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:41,440
told you, I told you in a rampage about this publicly on the SC giving it to me in person.

104
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:51,440
And then you then integrated me by saying Skype only. What could be considered as racism if

105
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:59,120
only we would be of different race. Racism, shortly speaking, gives this interview to me in person

106
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:10,880
or fuck you. It will never happen. You bastard. Oh, please. So speaking of racism, Adam,

107
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:20,960
have you had about such a thing or issue as this happening particularly in UK that, you know,

108
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,520
there is an employer or business owner. Yeah, almost like I'm coming straight blogger. First of all,

109
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,560
as I said, what we're going to do is I'm going to set up a time when I'm going to be in London,

110
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,520
because I'm going to have to be in London anyway to do stuff at the office. And you'll just have to

111
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,520
come on over. Right? Because the problem is you always want to meet me in the weekend, which is just

112
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:50,160
not really feasible. I am messing around so much with all the knobs. It is, it's a knobby day. That's

113
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,600
for sure. Manaja, and he has a worker. And this worker is a person of color. But this worker is

114
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,440
lazy or is underperforming. Oh, you know what? I'm not interested. Comics are blogger. It's about

115
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,880
your racism thing. And I'm over that. All the newspapers here, once again, full of Shilpa Shetty winning

116
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:16,800
the celebrity big brother television show slash contest slash reality program. I think people are

117
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,840
enjoying it. And I predict she's going to be a huge star. I think she already got some kind of TV

118
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,040
gig that they offered her. Now, I think she's going to do a lot of stuff over here. The bother would

119
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,080
stuff. I've never really been able to get into it. Maybe I have to see it on a big screen. Maybe

120
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,320
someone has to explain a little bit of the backstory. And maybe I love the dancing and so the

121
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,880
choreography and all the wardrobe is all beautiful. It's in a photography is fantastic. But I just don't

122
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,400
I can't really get into the story if you don't mind. Hey, you know what? Let's, uh, let's get this thing

123
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,160
rolling here. It's time to talk about everybody's girlfriend. The green color of Mercedes 300 turbo

124
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,040
yelled just stays shining.

125
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:18,140
Oh, sing along every ride the trained need a criminal central luxury dream

126
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:24,720
watch a Triomie triumony to Les Dubaiオ- Diesel set to bring Tri familee trip

127
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:35,160
All right, so here's what's coming on the Gmail regarding Trinity.

128
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,760
First of all, we have a Google map of retail biodiesel locations.

129
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,960
It's at BrevardBioDiesel.org.

130
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,440
Excuse me, for that nasty Splendid comment.

131
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
Can we?

132
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,440
Splendid?

133
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Since sale moment with a Splendid twist, that's what it was.

134
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,040
Can we get a coffee sponsor already?

135
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,480
I'm so sick and tired of promoting since sale for free.

136
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,200
Bravo, Romeo, Echo, Victor, Alpha, Romeo, Delta, biodiesel.org.

137
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,680
And there's a map there.

138
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,300
It's pretty extensive, although there are some major gaps with this, of course, as retail

139
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,440
locations, and it's listed by, you know, what grade of biodiesel they have.

140
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,200
So what I'm looking for is someone who can help me with one of these Google maps, because

141
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,120
now we have this part, can we take that data, can we start filling in the spots?

142
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,520
So we have, you know, no more than like 100 miles between each individual spot so we can

143
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
start a route.

144
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:39,800
And everybody should be able to add themselves as a, a biodiesel stop, b, a biodiesel point

145
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:48,400
of interest, c, a podcaster, and then d willing to help out anyway you can.

146
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,200
So if we get all those points on the map, then we can start to build up a route and

147
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,200
believe me, this is not going to be limited to the United States.

148
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,080
That's one thing, what's abundantly clear.

149
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,960
Here's an update from Rosie from pod show HQ Adam.

150
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,560
Here's the new update on Trinity.

151
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,880
Okay, so remember what happened was, I drove out to Concord to visit fries on the

152
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,880
way back, all of a sudden, she, she conked out.

153
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,280
I was completely right about the fuel starvation, although incorrect about the,

154
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,520
the lines being clogged up, here's what's going on.

155
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,200
The gas tank appears to be crushed at the bottom.

156
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,080
This prevents the gas or the biodiesel from reaching the fuel line when the tank is low.

157
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,840
I have to admit the tank was about a quarter full.

158
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,280
So if the tank's full, no problem.

159
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,240
The mechanic recommends overhauling the current tank and replacing the fuel send in unit,

160
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,360
fuel send in unit, $97.50 gas tank overhaul, $168 plus two and a half hours labor.

161
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,040
The whole repair adds up to another $567.79 on top of the 500.

162
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,720
I just spent for them to do nothing but replace my battery, which I didn't need.

163
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:01,000
On top of the transmission, which was like $2,000 to $3,000 on top of the,

164
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,120
well, doesn't matter.

165
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,880
I got a lot of money in this baby, and she's worth it.

166
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
So yes, of course, the cost has approved.

167
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,040
Absolutely, we got to get her on the road.

168
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,920
So she's running.

169
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,120
That's the good news.

170
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,520
It's no junk clogged up in the engine and was purely a gas tank initiative or issue.

171
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,080
Love it.

172
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,240
Who's this?

173
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:22,960
Scott.

174
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,600
From topdeadcenter.podshow.com, does Trinity have a trailer hitch?

175
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,080
No, I don't think so.

176
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,720
Because if you get a trailer, well, Trinity could pull her own biodiesel refinery.

177
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,440
Now, that is a damn good idea.

178
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,840
Because then you can get Google Earth or Google Maps, and you could get all the fast food restaurants.

179
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,840
This makes it a little more complex.

180
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,360
But if we act, you know what, okay, so here's an idea.

181
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,800
Why do we put a trailer hitch on the Trinity?

182
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,000
God, I like this a lot.

183
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,760
And so in addition to visiting biodiesel points throughout the country, she could also

184
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,320
visit biodiesel friendly.

185
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,040
This is great.

186
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,680
Biodiesel friendly restaurants, and they'll donate vegetable oil, you know, just stuff that

187
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,520
they got laying around got to get rid of anyway.

188
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,720
And, you know, and then Trinity can process her, you know, right there on the spot.

189
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,600
I like that a lot.

190
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,840
There are a couple of companies who make, who make the biodiesel kits.

191
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,600
They're about, what are they?

192
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,960
They're about $1,500 for a complete kit.

193
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,560
And it could indeed fit on a trailer and be pulled around behind or so.

194
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,640
I really like that idea.

195
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,640
Let's add that one to the mix.

196
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,880
I still don't have anyone to actually maintain this map of wonderful points.

197
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,520
But I think the more I read the, the more I read emails coming in and people's ideas,

198
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,160
the more I'm liking the whole idea of managing it through one Google map.

199
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,440
That just has all this information because they don't be very easy to plot out our trip.

200
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,080
So, if please, if you understand how to make do these map mashups,

201
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,200
please get in touch with the adamatpodshow.com.

202
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,720
Cameron Patterson sent me interesting link mini-box mini-box.com.

203
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,040
Company that makes cars, PCs for cars.

204
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,360
I don't know, I think we're, we're having, we have a call with Nokia today.

205
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,840
This afternoon, I'm going to see if we can get to Nokia to jump on board because it would be a

206
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,280
perfect application to run on, I would say on the internet tablet.

207
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,640
I mean, it's got a camera built in. It can communicate with a cell phone.

208
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,800
It can do all these things you need. It runs on Linux. So, pretty much bullet proof.

209
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,240
And of course, it communicates with Wi-Fi. I mean, there's a whole bunch of things we can do there.

210
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:53,680
What's this one? From Ola, Ola Christian Vale.

211
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,600
I think that's the way it pronounces name. He says, dude, you got a sender to the Ferro Islands.

212
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:07,120
After a tour of the UK Trinity could go on a North Atlantic tour from Scrabster, Scotland to the Ferro Islands.

213
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,200
Iceland, on to Norway, maybe even Denmark. I said to me a couple of pictures. Yes, I would love that.

214
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,640
I think we can get it around the world. Do you think it's not possible? I think this podcasting

215
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,960
stuff has enough people committed to promoting podcasting and to promoting something like

216
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,280
independence of big oil. This one from Dave from New York.

217
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,800
Adam, I'm totally stoked on this Trinity across the USA concept for it's free

218
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,880
Trinity, by the way. I just want to make sure that we keep Doug Pilgrim's original idea and

219
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,160
tacked free Trinity. Adam, there's nothing green about an egg nog color. Let me my pal cover her

220
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,120
and Astro turf. We've done it with vehicles in Europe in New York City. It looks perfect. And the

221
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,600
response in the street is unbelievable. Imagine how it would look on a bends. If you want to

222
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,760
attract attention this way, people used to leave us gifts on the car like golf balls or vegetable.

223
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,560
Sometimes we'd come back to where we parked to find chicks, sunbathing on the roof. Okay,

224
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,600
good idea. I think I think we shouldn't get our Astro turf. So we'll do that the

225
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:20,960
minute she hits New York. Hi, Adam. It's Timothy from the Twisted Risk podcast.

226
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,360
Not just finished listening to DSC 533. Normally I speak about riding on two wheels in such.

227
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,720
But there's something else I've got more than a passing interesting. And that's biodies. In fact,

228
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,840
it's that sweet smelling oil or more accurately Trinity that got me listening to the daily

229
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,360
source code in the first place. You see, I chew on an older Mercedes diesel. In fact, my 1982

230
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:53,200
300 TD aka Moby is pretty much an exact replica of your beloved Trinity. My great will of a car

231
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,320
was purchased with the same goal of burning biodiesel and vegetable oil. I believe I may be the

232
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,360
only other podcaster out there with the same car as yourself. Now, don't go think in that. I'm

233
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,320
some kind of freakish curie groupie. I had my car well before Trinity found a way. So it's natural

234
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,680
that all this talk about the free-trandy project has me pumped up with vigor. Here are my thoughts

235
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,520
on the free-trandy thing. One listener suggested making it an international event by shipping

236
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,880
Trinity to Europe when she reaches these coast. But you do realize that you don't have to go over

237
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,400
seas to break the border. Tell you what, get Trinity up here to Toronto and I'll ensure that she's

238
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,040
fed with the green grease that's good for her. We can introduce her to my movie and who knows,

239
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,000
maybe they could get busy and have a little smart car together, right? Now, producing a

240
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,520
older cyclopodcast as I do, I'm aware of a company called Star Tracks, that's star-tr-a-w-x.

241
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,480
That has tracking units that long distance bike riders use to keep their friends and family

242
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,000
at home updated automatically if they're aware about. Such units have been used extensively and

243
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
successfully in the 11 day 11,000 mile iron butt rally as well as the world rally championship

244
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,200
if you're more akin to four wheels. When are you considering this trip to take place anyway?

245
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,000
If it's around the summer solstice, the second annual podcasters across borders,

246
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,920
aka podgimp Canada will run from June 22 to 24th in Kingston, Ontario. That's just east of Toronto

247
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,280
and on the way to Boston, and the perfect pit stop for Trinity in this little picturesque and

248
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:36,080
historic town on Lake Ontario. If, however, it's too early in the year, this parade of bio-fuel vehicles,

249
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,400
you envision may have issues with cold vegetable oil, and that could cause some problems for some

250
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,400
engines. Not good. So those are my two Canadian sense on the whole idea. I hope you can make use

251
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,800
of some of the points I brought up and I'd love to see Trinity make her way north of the border

252
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,520
for a visit. Take care Adam. This is Timothy Pilgrim. See ya. All right Timothy. Yeah, absolutely.

253
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,040
I mean, again, we just have to get this map started out so everyone can put their,

254
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,480
everyone could put their, their place mark on and link to their podcast or pictures or

255
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,520
or maybe have a video and so we can get a good idea if we want to be involved in this.

256
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,560
Maybe even some folks who are listening to serious stars 102 might want to get involved.

257
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,080
Really easy. Go to dailysourcecode.com download the rest of the show or send me an email

258
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,840
Adam at podshow.com. Love to hear from you guys as well. And thanks for listening and they're gone.

259
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,560
Yeah, I'm getting excited about this. This is going to be really cool.

260
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,640
Hi Adam. It's Daisy here from podcasting. I'm just catching up with the charity after getting

261
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:50,480
a podcatcher on my Nakia phone. I got one of those Nakia in 91 music phones and you're on my

262
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:58,480
podcatcher. That means I can hear your pipes without going near my computer. I must say that's really nice

263
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,720
on those Nakia phones. As you say it up there in Ireland is, uh, and I have that on my E61. That's the

264
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,120
the podcatcher. It has a little, uh, a little application that'll download podcats. I do miss that on the

265
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,480
on the N800 tablet. Although I figured out some other ways to get to get my favorite podcats. You

266
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,280
can actually use the, uh, what is it? The play in Windows media player button on any pod show site.

267
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:27,040
It'll open up, um, either the show with all of its archives or you can open up a channel that way,

268
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,960
which works pretty well. But that's just pretty good. I have to agree. Also, it right there.

269
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,920
And you've got directories. You've got the top pod show picks. You've got, uh, all of podcats

270
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,480
stally, podcats pickle is on there. It's a ton of different podcats that work. So a really good place

271
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:47,040
to go find and certainly to subscribe to shows. Anyway, I'm here trying some hazelnut splendor.

272
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,480
When I hear dog talking to you about taking trinity across the states, I think that's a deadly

273
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,520
idea. And I was wondering, would dog pick up an Irish hitchhiker along the way?

274
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,800
His name is Doug. I know you're saying Doug, but it sounds a bit like dog. It's kind of like

275
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,640
a girl or a bad member. There is no one greener in the world than I was Irish, you know?

276
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:18,800
I mean, if he's driving from California to Massachusetts, he must be going through Kansas, right?

277
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,600
So I figured I could meet up with trinity and dog in Kansas. Then talk the lads into checking out

278
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,960
some wood pellet stoves in Iowa. Imagine that trinity hole, a boshal of wood pellets from my

279
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,680
farming cousins in Iowa. Isn't that handy that we just decided to put a trailer here, John,

280
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,120
or, huh? Yeah, went all through to Iowa to farm. I could snap shots from my mnuckier phone.

281
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,760
I'm using zontag so that I can just take a picture and then automatically tag it and send it to

282
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,920
flicker right after reviewing the photo. You see, this is what's going to work really well. Everybody

283
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,800
has their tools, their devices, they know how to get stuff up on the web, they know how to link

284
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,000
stuff. So I think this map will be so cool. We've done a few carcass here in Tipperary,

285
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,240
so it's fair to say that if I tagged along, you'll get some European perspective on the great

286
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:18,000
biodiesel adventure. And if you set this up this summer, we'll have a Nokia in 95 phone for the trip.

287
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,320
We've been playing around with the developer's model now and it's really, really slick.

288
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,640
You wouldn't believe the things that I can actually do. What else? Well,

289
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,960
I think Trinity should visit the Amish community in Pennsylvania dot country.

290
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,800
Amish have never been on a podcast, so Trinity will be recording the first Amish words,

291
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,600
exclusive to Pod Show listeners. Another thing, Adam.

292
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,080
Hold on a second, before you get to that, good idea. I mean, that's also important.

293
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,520
It's, that would be an interesting sight to see. I don't know if there's, if

294
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,280
Amish people have ever, have never been recorded. I mean, I've certainly seen documentaries.

295
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,720
I don't know what they think of Trinity. It's not, it's not quite playing according to their rules.

296
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,600
It's getting pretty close though. Maybe they could supply us with some fuel.

297
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,920
You're not keeping Trinity that baby poo yellow for the trip.

298
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,680
I am a baby.

299
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,320
You're a good coach at the outgreen for us.

300
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,480
I don't know the something about the the eggnog white eggnog yellow, baby poo yellow.

301
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,720
You know what? That's disgusting. Thanks for calling. I really appreciate it.

302
00:28:46,720 --> 00:29:03,120
Welcome to this week in London to the podcast about my hometown. You're going to enjoy as much as I do.

303
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,520
I love this city and I want to share in some of the things that happen here. Tell you a little

304
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,400
about what's going on. Tell you what to do, what not to do. Thanks for avoiding things to enjoy.

305
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,200
You can find out the subscription details at London.botsho.com.

306
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,480
You can find the website itself at www.isweekinlandon.co.uk.

307
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,600
In a can email me about this week in London at gmail.com. Thanks very much.

308
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,800
Talk to you later.

309
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,440
Yeah, that's been a show that I've been listening to myself because you know London's like my town now

310
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,200
and it's really nice to hear what's going on. Great show. Thanks for the promo.

311
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,440
All right, you don't forget to close the whole Trinity segment with the official theme song.

312
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,560
You can't talk about Trinity without the bookmark and heard like a nice compact baby poo sandwich

313
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,960
between Jeff Smith's jingles on either side.

314
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:18,480
Trinity, let the bio diesel set your green, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity,

315
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,600
free Trinity, save the world, win valuable prizes, Trinity.

316
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,120
So I wanted to open a one new line of conversation. Otherwise it's all going to be about Trinity

317
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,440
in the name of my house, which is a little bit boring. I do understand that. This comment came

318
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,720
in last week while I was in San Francisco. I've been saving it because I thought it was a very

319
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,720
interesting question. One that I might even be able to answer myself in some ways.

320
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,600
But have a listen to it and I'd love to hear your take on it.

321
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,280
Forgive me, podfighter, if I have seen it as barely three months since I last left the voice

322
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:59,600
mail message. I'm calling you from work because I have a monumental question.

323
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,280
Sort of on the same lines as the folding or scrunching and we know how well that took us.

324
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:12,080
I work for a very cool put, very posh company. We have lots of very cool put, very posh, very

325
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:19,840
highly educated people. My question is this. How is it that in such a working environment?

326
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,920
When I come to use the bathrooms, the toilets, whatever you wish to call them, quite often,

327
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:33,440
there is toilet paper, strewn across the floor. We also have problems with broken toilet seats,

328
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:40,400
with soap dispenses that have been broken, with paper towels in the sink. We're talking about

329
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:46,160
highly educated people here and they can't do the most simple of hygiene and things.

330
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:54,480
Is it just happening in my office? Do people sort of portray this corporate front

331
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,000
only to go out to the privacy of the bathroom and allow it loose?

332
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,440
Hmm. Any help here in any place would be very much appreciated.

333
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,440
Isn't that interesting? And you know what? I do see that quite a lot.

334
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:21,280
And I don't know exactly what it is. The question is, are posh people pigs and if so, why?

335
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,160
Adam at poncho.com. And of course, oh, I should actually do the, let's see where is it here.

336
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,480
I haven't done this in a while. Let's give out the UK number to call in with your voicemail

337
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,840
comments. Would love to hear from you.

338
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,480
So, a while ago, I was reintroduced to a friend of mine who hadn't spoken to in years.

339
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,640
Rudy Sarza, who I met when he was a base player for white snake. Currently, he's playing with

340
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,800
the DO. And I was introduced by Ty Poe. And a lot of podcasts with no who Ty Poe is or

341
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,880
Prince of Pessa. I guess is how she signs their emails. She's a huge promoter of pod save music.

342
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,240
In particular, Sophia Ramos. And she has Rudy's email address and said, no, you know,

343
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,760
a little reintroduction. So, I was really nice. And Rudy has a book out called Off the Rails.

344
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:38,720
And it's about his time with Randy Rhodes, which of course was in Ozzy's band and

345
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:46,320
quite riot. And I read this book. I read to see it. It took a while to deliver. I bought it off

346
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,680
of Amazon. It took maybe two and a half, maybe in three weeks to get here. Because I don't know.

347
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,440
I don't know how Amazon works. But I guess it's not readily available on the shelf. But it was a

348
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:02,640
very good read. It filled in a lot of blanks for me about a period of rock and roll. When I just

349
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,320
before, I got into a television, even before MTV in the Netherlands, even during some of that time.

350
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,600
It just it filled in a lot of blanks. Also about Rudy stuff. I didn't know. And it's written in a

351
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,280
very person. It's almost, I would have to say it's a bit webloggish like he kept a diary while it was

352
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,880
on the road in the late 70s and in the 80s. And he may still be keeping a diary. I don't know.

353
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,920
But it's a great way, you know, to have notes to go back and write about your experiences,

354
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,920
particularly the day when Randy died, which is just mailing you read about this, it's horrible.

355
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:44,160
In fact, Rudy and other people on the tour bus are lucky to be alive because the aircraft

356
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,760
that Randy was in, you know, the wing, I think struck the bus first before crashed into a

357
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,360
into a private residence. Anyway, I mean, you'd have to read the book.

358
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,760
And I was very, well, first of all, I was pleasantly surprised when I heard that to quiet riot had

359
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,440
uploaded a few new songs from their rehab CD to the Podsake Music Network. And

360
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Brent from PodsakeauRadio, PodsakeauRadio.com, had an interview with Kevin Dubrow of Quiet Riot.

361
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,640
And so I'm listening to this interview. And I was quite amazed at the following piece that I heard.

362
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:31,120
Listen to this. I'm sober. And I liked the people on playing with better.

363
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,680
Better than playing with the Rudy Sarasel and Randy Rhodes.

364
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,280
Well, no, better than playing with the Sarasel. Randy Rhodes, I adore playing with.

365
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,960
So what's better than playing with better than playing with Rudy and Carlos?

366
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,800
I don't, don't thank you, you liked playing too much with Rudy. What was the deal with Rudy?

367
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,560
I, you know, I really want to get into it. It's over. And the, the gift of the

368
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,640
situation is I'm no longer playing with him. So the fact that I don't have to play with him anymore,

369
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,080
it makes it so it's a good thing. It's a good for him. It's good for everybody.

370
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:05,280
Good for everybody involved. You know, so I didn't read a single bad word about anyone in this entire book.

371
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,320
Certainly not about band members. Only about members of the press. But, you know, that was kind of a

372
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:17,040
running theme throughout the book where Rudy's picking up reviews from the previous night's show.

373
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,200
And he can tell exactly when the reviewer wasn't actually there. He just kind of wrote some

374
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,200
shit up just to get his article in. But not a bad word. And like, listen to this Kevin to brown guy.

375
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,560
Dude, what's up with that? You know, first of all, you say something, I guess it's kind of disparaging.

376
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,160
You know, you say like, well, I'm too happy. I'm not playing with people. I want to.

377
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,200
And then when when you're asked to explain, you're like, oh, well, I don't have to talk about that.

378
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,760
Fuck you, dickhead. What's your problem? It's really unhealthy, by the way, to keep that shit

379
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:59,600
pent up after 20 years, you know? So let's, let's get it out. Get it out and the open.

380
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,320
This may help you. Quiet, Ryan, free.

381
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,680
With your dark nature, you don't know what that takes. No, no, no.

382
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:50,000
It's a marathon now. Can't you see? For a turn in your dark enemy. Here are voice that keeps on telling me.

383
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm the drummer. Free from the cover. Free of the beast. Free.

384
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:16,720
I'm not on my head. Free of the dress. The moment we miss. I'm free.

385
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,080
You can't face a title, demons. A world cup is a rain. And no, no, no.

386
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:46,560
You suck the light fire of every room. How much can I take? I don't know.

387
00:38:51,600 --> 00:39:00,320
Look a flower that merges into the touch. So beautiful, but it takes so much of the light, the light in the side of me.

388
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:18,320
I'm free. I'm free. I'm the drummer. Free from the cover. Free of the beast. Free. I'm not on my head.

389
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:31,680
Free of the dress. The moment we miss. I was free.

390
00:39:48,320 --> 00:40:10,320
I'm free. Free of the drummer. Free from the cover. Free of the beast. Free. I'm not on my head. Free from the dress. The moment we miss.

391
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:28,320
Free. Free of the drummer. Free from the cover. Free of the beast. Free. I'm not on my head. Free of the dress.

392
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:39,440
The moment the moment we miss. I was free. You can fight that at the pot safe using that work.

393
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,960
Quiet, quiet, free. Links to all the songs and all read up links in today's show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

394
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:56,160
And to Kevin, come on, man. Don't hold no grudges. It's just unhealthy.

395
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,640
All right, that's it for today. 41 minutes exactly. Fantastic time. I'll work on the sound.

396
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,680
I apologize if I blew your dreams out a couple of times tomorrow. We'll be back once again from the

397
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,320
curry manner. On the west side of G-town, dailysourcecode.com,

398
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,240
Adam at podshow.com. Take everybody. Have a nice day. Bye.
