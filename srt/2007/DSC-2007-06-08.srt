1

Another pod show pod guest.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,440
Stink!

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,240
We interrupt the show for a special announcement from Pod Show HQ.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,880
Hey, I've been even, I've been just hold on a minute, just hold on a minute, I got another call, hold on.

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,320
Yeah, yeah, Danny. What do you mean you're lost of?

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,280
What? What?

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,520
He's seven feet tall, he's got blonde bushy hair, it's like tracking big bird down man hat,

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
and how could you lose him?

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,640
Would you understand that we're not going to be able to listen to the DSC on this Thursday?

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
That's missing a show, that's not going to work, Johnny.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,040
He got to find Adam. We need the DSC 615. Before you know, it's going to be football Friday.

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,520
Just do it, Johnny.

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,560
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,320
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,600
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

26
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,280
Head in back to London, get my life all track again.

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,840
Though my stop off is made.

28
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,800
Then you see, and I would date, I'd work in your bar.

29
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,120
In the States, in the student's area,

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,760
finally went to far.

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,880
When I left, I'd keep your car.

32
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,920
Goodbye, New York.

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,200
Goodbye, New York.

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,480
Goodbye, New York.

35
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Goodbye, New York.

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm going to walk you made it.

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,520
So be easy to decide.

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,400
When I turn a bit to summer, I'll just 25.

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,200
Now I barely feel alive.

40
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,400
Goodbye, New York.

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,200
Goodbye, New York.

42
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Goodbye, New York.

43
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
Goodbye, New York.

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,360
Goodbye, New York.

45
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,160
Goodbye, New York.

46
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,400
Goodbye, New York.

47
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:36,480
As you die, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

48
00:04:36,480 --> 00:05:06,480
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

49
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:17,260
I mean, perfect, it's not a pot-safe music network.

50
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,120
One search term from New York and you come up with the shakes, you would find New York,

51
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,200
we are leaving by the time you get this letter on this podcast, I'll be back in London

52
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
town.

53
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,360
Okay, it's almost perfect, but I won't be in London.

54
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,240
I'll be in San Francisco.

55
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,680
I'll bar Friday everybody, episode number 615 of the Daily Source Code.

56
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,920
It's a maximum music for bar Friday with lots of stuff to wrap up for the week.

57
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,200
A new music, Andreas Wiser, like I should do.

58
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,720
Yeah, but I won't, then I won't be there.

59
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,920
Wanna stay and maybe I won't go home.

60
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,360
But I won't, then I won't be there.

61
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:25,720
Stick around because I don't know.

62
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:40,120
If I love you, like I should do, and if I'm gonna treat you right, if I love you, like I should,

63
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:49,320
do, and if I ever go to make you mine.

64
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:59,160
You said come on now, oh, because I don't know I, this is taking too long.

65
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,440
And if there's a problem now, then we can work it out.

66
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,960
Tell me it's something wrong, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't,

67
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,800
and I won't, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't.

68
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:29,440
And I won't, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't.

69
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:44,620
If I love you, like I should, and if I'm gonna treat you right, if I love you, like I should do,

70
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:50,620
If I ever go on, make you mine

71
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:58,620
It's hard, baby, I know it's hard

72
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,620
There's if I'm gonna ride you

73
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,620
I'm gonna love you forever

74
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:16,620
If I ever go on, make you mine

75
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,620
It's hard, baby, I know it's hard

76
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,620
If I ever go on, make you mine

77
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,620
It's hard, baby, I know it's hard

78
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,620
Tell me where this guy is from

79
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,620
The name kind of gives it away

80
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,620
Doesn't it there?

81
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,620
Like I should do, the guy's got three songs in the podcast

82
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,620
Music Network. It was really hard to sign

83
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,620
Which one to play? He's from Sweden 21 years old

84
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,620
Awesome, brand new to the podcast

85
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,620
Music Network, I think he is

86
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,620
Let me just check you, let me see, yeah

87
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,620
Uploaded in May and in June

88
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,620
Hey everybody, wrap it up a week in the big apple

89
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,620
Another beautiful day, I just got down from the rooftop

90
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,620
The Grammarcy Park Hotel

91
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Of course, I didn't tell you what hotel I was in

92
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,620
Because while we were able to do that a year or two years ago

93
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,620
I can't do it anymore

94
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,620
Because I could cause in the middle of the night

95
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,620
So I'll be leaving today

96
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,620
Hold on a second, let me just

97
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,620
The mobile setup is exactly what it should be today

98
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,620
And it's warm, it's already past the 80 degree mark

99
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,620
It's still relatively early in the morning

100
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,620
I gotta tell you, the Grammarcy Park Hotel

101
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,620
There's something I really, really like about this hotel

102
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,620
And there's something I really, really hate about this hotel

103
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,620
The rooftop terrace, I think, is a stroke of genius

104
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,620
I'll see if I can find a picture of this thing

105
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,620
To put it up online so you can take a look at it

106
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,620
But they have this wraparound terrace

107
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,620
Roof top

108
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,620
And they have retractable roof

109
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,620
And just tons of plants all over the place

110
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,620
Isn't he in Shreger Hotel

111
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,620
So it's one of those like

112
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,620
You know, kind of way too hip for itself

113
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,620
Bullshit hotels, but that thing

114
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,620
That rooftop is just spectacular

115
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,620
Really, it's too bad I don't smoke anymore

116
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Because you can sit up there and drink and smoke

117
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,620
And you know, just lounge around

118
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,620
It's awesome, totally awesome

119
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,620
Now, the hotel rooms itself

120
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,620
You know, as I said, it's one of these

121
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,620
In Shreger Hotel, so you know, they got like all kinds of weird furniture, weird dimensions

122
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,620
Interesting colors

123
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,620
Totally a designer's wet dream, I presume

124
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,620
But in the bathroom

125
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,620
They had to go all like

126
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,620
You know, funky cool on the lighting

127
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,620
And it's so incredibly stupid

128
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,620
They have a string of lights hanging down the left hand side of the mirror

129
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,620
Okay

130
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,620
And you know, it's like, you know, naked light bulbs, intertwined wires

131
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,620
You know, it's supposed to be cool looking

132
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,620
And it looks cool

133
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,620
And it gives off a great light

134
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,620
The problem is it's only on one side of the mirror

135
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,620
So you don't, you can't even when you're shaving

136
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,620
You can't, I can't even see my side burns on that on that side

137
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,620
So you like try to turn into the light

138
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,620
And it's stupid

139
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,620
Stop it

140
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,620
The internet's okay, though, which makes up for a lot

141
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,620
Because these days

142
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,620
I definitely make my decisions on

143
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,620
Where I'm going to stay based upon

144
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,620
Internet access

145
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,620
And ability to shave

146
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,620
Help us

147
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,620
To suck less

148
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,620
Suck less touch

149
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,620
Oh, Angie

150
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,620
Angie, Angie

151
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,620
I played that

152
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,620
You're going to start hearing that

153
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,620
As one of our D-gaps pre-rolls

154
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,620
Nice and short and sweet into the point

155
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,620
But Angie, be hearing you sing that

156
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,620
I'm like, maybe, you know, I love what you do with love spirals

157
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,620
But you may want to consider

158
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,620
Trying out an evergreen classic

159
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,620
Because I think you've got the perfect voice ward, baby

160
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,620
Hello D-S-C, this is Charles

161
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,620
Your drunk Londoner, long time no show me

162
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,620
I have no idea what's going on

163
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,620
Still on the D-S-C

164
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,620
I have absolutely no idea

165
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,620
In the last month I've had so much happened to me

166
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,620
Part of movie flat and having no broadband

167
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,620
Or phone line or anything like that

168
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,620
Can't get online

169
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,620
So I'm not allowed to download the B-S-C

170
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,620
However, one fabulous thing that happened to me was that

171
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,620
Our illustrator, leader

172
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,620
Big brother, podge, pod for the himself

173
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,620
Adam, Terry

174
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,620
Sent me a beautiful raid

175
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,620
I pod nano

176
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,620
He was given

177
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,620
By Virgin Atlantic

178
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,620
And this is a phone call to say

179
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,620
All hail

180
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,620
Sir Adam of Curry

181
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,620
Thank you so much

182
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,620
Really

183
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,620
I'm really touched by the fact that you've sent it to me

184
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,620
And as I said before

185
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,620
I'm planning on

186
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,620
Saving up some money and getting myself an iPod

187
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,620
And so I can maybe auction this one off

188
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,620
At a later date

189
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,620
A genuine Adam Curry artifact

190
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,620
So as and when I do that

191
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,620
I will let you all know

192
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,620
And you can all do it on it

193
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,620
Or you can do a composition of something

194
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,620
Who knows?

195
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,620
Anyway, that was it really

196
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,620
Rambling on

197
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,620
There was another thing

198
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,620
But I can't remember what it is

199
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,620
Of course I can

200
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,620
Well, thanks for listening

201
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,620
I will be downloading the GSD

202
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,620
When I can and I will be chewed in

203
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,620
And you guys can all

204
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,620
Feel me in what's going on

205
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,620
Alrighty

206
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,620
Thank you

207
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,620
Charles

208
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,620
The Drunken Londoner

209
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,620
A little bit sauce today

210
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,620
Clearly and he's obviously received

211
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,620
The Red Virgin Atlantic iPod Nano

212
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,620
That I sent to him because you know

213
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,620
This is a guy who contributes to the show

214
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,620
On a weekly basis

215
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,620
Often several times a week

216
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,620
He got completely jacked

217
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,620
His computer is iPod

218
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,620
His cell phone

219
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,620
His entire life was basically stolen from him

220
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,620
And I felt really shitty about it

221
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,620
So at least now he can somehow

222
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,620
Listen to the Charlie and continue to

223
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,620
You can find a phone somewhere in the UK

224
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,620
I'm sure Charles

225
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,620
So apologies of course for the

226
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,620
For the low output of episodes this week

227
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,620
It's been just absolutely nuts

228
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,620
You have to understand that

229
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,620
When we go on these quarterly

230
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,620
John's to New York

231
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,620
We're going to Madison Avenue

232
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,620
We do it basically three things

233
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,620
We go to

234
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,620
We go to Madison Avenue

235
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,620
We go to Madison Avenue

236
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,620
We follow up on campaigns that have worked

237
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,620
And as an example

238
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,620
Universal McCann is an agency

239
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,620
We've done a lot of work with a lot of the Johnson

240
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,620
Johnson products

241
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
The Splenda campaign

242
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,620
The KY campaign

243
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,620
The

244
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,620
I'm still pissed that I didn't get to

245
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,620
Participate in the KY campaign

246
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,620
My show was rejected

247
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,620
I don't know why

248
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,620
Yeah

249
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,620
Then of course there's

250
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,620
New business that we're following through

251
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,620
And then there's a lot of education

252
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,620
We're still educating and learn something really really interesting

253
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,620
Because a lot of

254
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,620
A lot of podcasting these days

255
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,620
Is video and people

256
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,620
I think advertising in general

257
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,620
It's like the easiest path to

258
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,620
Understanding oh I can see this video

259
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,620
I understand it's not

260
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,620
It's also very difficult to present audio

261
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,620
In a meeting

262
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,620
Because you're all kind of like

263
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,620
Steering at your navel while you're listening to something

264
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,620
So it's not the easiest thing in the world to sell

265
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,620
However, we know to something very interesting

266
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,620
With a number of buyers

267
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,620
And I'd love some feedback from

268
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,620
From the audience and in this case

269
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,620
Definitely from some podcasters as well

270
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,620
It turns out

271
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,620
So the way it goes is an advertiser

272
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,620
And actually advertisers are so incredibly smart

273
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,620
They know exactly who they want to target

274
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,620
They know like between 50

275
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,620
And 53 years old

276
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,620
And I want them to be making

277
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,620
More than $60,000 a year

278
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,620
And it's very very targeted

279
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,620
And of course with podcasting

280
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,620
When it comes to interests

281
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,620
Particularly interest in niche groups

282
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,620
We can help advertisers

283
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,620
Talk directly to the audience

284
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,620
They're interested in and the relevance

285
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,620
Should be there because it's

286
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,620
Yeah, it's like games

287
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,620
For games show some real simple stuff

288
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,620
Health and food and sports

289
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,620
But when they hear the word podcasting

290
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,620
They're like, hey, what I'm not sure what that is

291
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,620
But when they hear internet radio

292
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,620
They say, yeah, go, I'll buy some of that

293
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,620
How interesting is that

294
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,620
So is the definition of internet radio

295
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,620
Does that have to do with the delivery mechanism

296
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,620
Because traditionally we talk about internet radio

297
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,620
A streaming radio streaming audio

298
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,620
But is there any difference with a podcast?

299
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,620
You can basically stream it

300
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,620
You click on a play button somewhere

301
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,620
And it starts streaming in

302
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,620
The only difference is you're hearing it from beginning to end

303
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,620
And you have some control over it

304
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,620
Versus a stream where you fall in the middle

305
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,620
And you don't have control over

306
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,620
Forwards and backwards

307
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,620
Is there a difference when it comes to just the enjoyment of audio

308
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,620
And calling it internet radio versus podcasting

309
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,620
To the advertiser

310
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,620
When they hear a podcast and you tell them it's internet radio

311
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,620
They dig it

312
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,620
So something very, very interesting we learned

313
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,620
And of course I'll follow up on it

314
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,620
And let you know what happens with that

315
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,620
So but it literally is like

316
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Get up at 7 o'clock

317
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,620
8 o'clock it's the first breakfast meeting

318
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,620
And it just continues on until

319
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,620
At least 8 or 8 30 in the evening

320
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,620
But of course it's New York

321
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,620
This is where shit happens

322
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,620
The pace and everyone's just moving

323
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,620
And we have goals we know what we want to do

324
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,620
And it's the whole city is just vibrant

325
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,620
I've seen every single time I come here

326
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,620
I say the same thing

327
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,620
And I really love being here

328
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,620
And of course I also like Lee

329
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,620
Hey Adam this is Lisa from I love the company

330
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,620
And the awesome podcast

331
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,620
Hey rumor has that you're going to be in New York City

332
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,620
This is coming weekend

333
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,620
So just wondering if you're going to make it out to central park

334
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,620
To see David and Bluto play on the hill

335
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,620
Listen man, we'd love to see you out there

336
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,620
I'm going to send you a track from

337
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,620
For my soon to be released CD

338
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,620
Everybody else just check out

339
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,620
I feel like shit now

340
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,620
I should have been able to stay

341
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,620
For some day when David and Bluto's playing

342
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,620
Is a park

343
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,620
Fortunately, I'm going to miss it

344
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,620
Yeah, again

345
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,620
Next time round buddy, I promise

346
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,620
On my screen

347
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,620
It is eyes that I've seen in a smile

348
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
So invite him

349
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,620
Got five damn fantasy fighting

350
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
Now so hot

351
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,620
That she's steaming

352
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,620
I know I must be demon

353
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,620
So I run home in a evening

354
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,620
I'm checking in and seeing she's real

355
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,620
I've got a flying

356
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,620
She's got me out of my mind

357
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,620
I don't even know her

358
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,620
But I can't stop thinking about her now

359
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,620
I got a flying

360
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,620
She's got me out of my mind

361
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,620
I'm always getting a little bit crazy

362
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,620
But now I'm chasing a dinner that can't you baby

363
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:38,620
Sweet pain every time I

364
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,620
Realize she's not online

365
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,620
I realize

366
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,620
That therapy

367
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,620
Is a definite possibility

368
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,620
I walk through this city

369
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,620
I see faces just as pretty

370
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,620
But I run home in a evening

371
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,620
Still checking in and seeing she's real

372
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,620
I've got a flying

373
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,620
She's got me out of my mind

374
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,620
I don't even know her

375
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,620
But I can't stop thinking about her now

376
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,620
I got a flying

377
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,620
She's got me out of my mind

378
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,620
I'm always getting a little bit crazy

379
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,620
But now I'm chasing a dinner that can't you baby

380
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,620
Could be that has happened

381
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,620
And I finally off that deep end

382
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,620
Could be the way things are

383
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,620
I've left reality far behind

384
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,620
This obsession

385
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,620
I'm left with the same damn question

386
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,620
So I run home in a evening

387
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,620
Just checking in and seeing she's real

388
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,620
I've got a flying

389
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,620
She's got me out of my mind

390
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,620
I don't even know her

391
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,620
But I can't stop thinking about her now

392
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,620
I got a flying

393
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,620
She's got me out of my mind

394
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,620
I'm always getting a little bit crazy

395
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,620
But now I'm chasing a dinner that can't you baby

396
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,620
I got a flying

397
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
She's got me out of my mind

398
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,620
I don't even know her

399
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,620
But I can't stop thinking about her now

400
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,620
I got a flying

401
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,620
She's got me out of my mind

402
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,620
I'm always getting a little bit crazy

403
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:46,620
But now I'm chasing a dinner that can't you baby

404
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,620
Now I'm chasing a dinner that can't you baby

405
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,620
So if you're lucky someday in Central Park you'll see

406
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,620
Check it to our guy

407
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,620

And also check out his podcast

409
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,620
I love to come back

410
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
I love the company

411
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,620
I was at iLTC dot pot show dot com

412
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,620
Oh

413
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,620
I'm pissed about that

414
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,620
Hey, you know one other

415
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,620
Plus of the Grammcy Park Hotel

416
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,620
They have

417
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,620
Big finished David

418
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,620
They've got to HD television

419
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,620
And you know on home I've got the HD skybox

420
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,620
I've got the HD DVD player

421
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,620
I've just been too lazy and been doing too many things

422
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,620
To pick up the HD TV that I want to get

423
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,620
It is on the list too

424
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,620
So I've actually enjoyed watching HD TV for the past week

425
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,620
And you know what it's it is so sharp

426
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,620
When you when you watch like a like the morning program

427
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,620
So I was watching the like the today show

428
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,620
And good morning America

429
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,620
And you can see everything

430
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,620
I mean you see the studio floor

431
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,620
Which looks like shit

432
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,620
You see every single bump

433
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,620
And in

434
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,620
In in perfection

435
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,620
If you will

436
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,620
Of the of the people on television

437
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,620
I think

438
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,620
That once HD really is is

439
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,620
You know completely rolled out

440
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,620
And I'll take years

441
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,620
I'm sure before all the sets are converted to HD

442
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,620
I think it's really going to affect the way people perceive their their television heroes

443
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,620
And it's it's it's I think it's

444
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,620
I think the quality is just too good

445
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
I don't want to be on TV anymore

446
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
Although I will be on Bloomberg television

447
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,620
I think it's this coming Monday

448
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,620
I did the interview yesterday

449
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,620
With Mike Schneider

450
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,620
Who used to do the news on good morning America

451
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,620
I know Mike I met him several years ago

452
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,620
She's almost like a decade ago in the in the mid 90s

453
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,620
Nice guy and we talk for half an hour

454
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,620
This is a show called

455
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,620
Believe it's night talk

456
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,620
It airs in the evening on Bloomberg television

457
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,620
There's a couple times thing at 8 o'clock

458
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,620
9 o'clock in 10 o'clock

459
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,620
So you're bound to bump into it

460
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,620
But he's had some great guests on it

461
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,620
Russell Simmons on the other night

462
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,620
And so it was cool just to sit down

463
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,620
And and channel a little bit about

464
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,620
About podcasting about pod show

465
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,620
And it was also really nice to

466
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,620
I have to admit as much as I like sitting here at the table

467
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,620
In the hotel room with all my wires

468
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,620
My spaghetti factory of mixers and boxes and stuff

469
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,620
It was also really nice to sit in a completely

470
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,620
Climate-controlled air-conditioned soundproof studio

471
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
We're just like the sound is so dead

472
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,620
And the breeze of the air conditioning is just kind of

473
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,620
Wafting through the air

474
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,620
And you can have a really nice non-distracted chat

475
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,620
I do have to say if you got the money to build the studio like that

476
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,620
It can be very, very nice

477
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,620
Games, please

478
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,620
With that come

479
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,620
Hi Adam, just like you know on Gamesweasel

480
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,620
This week we're looking at virtual tennis

481
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,620

00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,620
Medal of on a game for the PlayStation 2

483
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,620
And we've got copies of World of Warcraft Expansion

484
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,620

485
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,620
If you need more info on that head over to

486
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,620
Gamesweasel.btpodshow.com

487
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:38,620
Yeah, what's up Adam, it's jersey time

488
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,620
The official musicologist of The Cha Cha

489
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,620
So what I've got for you this week I'm really excited about

490
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,620
Because it really shows the synergy going on between podcasters and musicians

491
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,620
The artist's name is Jim Armstrong

492
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
Yeah, yeah, he just did the jersey time theme song just there

493
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,620
But he's so much bigger than that because he's got a great new album

494
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,620
Finally up on the podcast of music that we're called Mudtown

495
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,620
It just got released on Sonic Deli Records

496
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,620
And Jim Armstrong really really understands the power of podcasting

497
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,620
His last album just did great brown bag lunch

498
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
And I've been a fan of his ever since

499
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,620
I thoroughly addicted to his new album Mudtown

500
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,620
And I think that you're going to be too

501
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,620
The song I'm going to play for you is called She Spins Around

502
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,620
It is absolutely perfect for a food bar Friday

503
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,620
Turn this up loud and enjoy man

504
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,620
This is some great stuff from Jim Armstrong

505
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,620
Rocky roll bangin

506
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,620
She came with a couple friends

507
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,620
That's how the host of the games

508
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,620
I look away when I come

509
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,620
Lookin at me

510
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,620
She spins around

511
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,620
Just like a hurricane

512
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,620
Nothing can ever

513
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,620
Just like a hurricane

514
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,620
She's running around away

515
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,620
And I'm okay with how the cram

516
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,620
Just counting the freckles on the skin

517
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,620
She was breathing out

518
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,620
I was breathing out, I was breathing

519
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,620
We're gettin' really raced, get on

520
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,620
The hot summer breeze

521
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,620
She turned this ball into a man

522
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,620
I've been on it in the cloud

523
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,620
And my face

524
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,620
And my wrong way

525
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,620
My scratch

526
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,620
My shabby me

527
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,620
She spins around

528
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,620
Just like a hurricane

529
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,620
Nothing can ever

530
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,620
Just like a hurricane

531
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,620
She's running around away

532
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,620
She spins around

533
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,620
Just like a hurricane

534
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,620
Nothing can ever

535
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,620
Just like a hurricane

536
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,620
She's running around away

537
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,620
And I'm okay with how the cram

538
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:08,620
She spins around

539
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,620
Just like a hurricane

540
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:30,620
Nothing can ever

541
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,620
Bring the damn she's right there on the way

542
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,620
I'm okay with how the crowd

543
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,620
Once again right on the money jersey time official music college is done

544
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
The shots chance to rail

545
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,620
For a maximum is a full bar Friday

546
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,620
Jim Armstrong she spins around from the positive music networks

547
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,620
You can find links to everyone play today on the show

At dailysourcecode.com

549
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,620
You know something really spectacular happened while I was away

550
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,620
I have back home in Jolly Oden, England

551
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,620
Oh yeah Richard Branson added again

552
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,620
Yeah then this is Richard and playgate

553
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,620
Just come across a little story that might be up your street for a biodiesel movement

554
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,620
Which is virgin your favorite travel company

555
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,620
Virgin trains infecting the UK

556
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,620
Lortzness first

557
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,620
Train powered by a biodiesel tomorrow

558
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,620
They're launching in London

559
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,620
It's going to be a used in station at 11h4 on Thursday 7 to 2

560
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,620
In the morning and

561
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,620
I'll search and stay in the head of a biodiesel train before

562
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,620
So just like I might not typically fancy

563
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,620
Bye for now

564
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,620
Darren, thank you very much

565
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,620
Thanks for the info

566
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,620
Sorry I missed that one

567
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,620
That's pretty cool

568
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,620
I of course I'd like to know what kind of biodiesel is it

569
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,620
I don't think that there's enough

570
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,620
Processing plants of the of the vegetable

571
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,620
I put into Trinity to actually make the trains run

572
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,620
But fantastic nonetheless

573
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,620
And once again showing that there are alternatives

574
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,620
To our independence upon foreign oil

575
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,620
As the president now himself is saying isn't that amazing

576
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,620
Brand new sponsor on the show

577
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,620
Sponsoring the hit test for today

578
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,620
Of course it's the football Friday

579
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,620
So that means young poletta standing by

580
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,620
He of course is along with myself

581
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,620
One of the charter members of the

582
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,620
Organization for preservation to the soundtrack of our lives

583
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,620
Better known as upsole

584
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,620
And of course upsole.org will soon be live

585
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,620
Young and I have it a good time with this

586
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,620
Today's sponsor the hit test is Lexus

587
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,620
And as I was thinking about the company and the car Lexus

588
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,620
I realized the last time I actually drove an Alexis

589
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,620
And I didn't even drive I sat in Alexis

590
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,620
Was during the MTV Beach House series

591
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,620
Bill Bellamy member good old Bill

592
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,620
And by the way I kind of lost track of Bill Bellamy

593
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,620
Because we used to hang out a little bit

594
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,620
And we'd play ex box and place

595
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,620
And we did a lot of that at the MTV Beach House

596
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,620
And so I've been looking into some of the materials

597
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,620
You know me I'm always interested in gadgetry

598
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,620
These Lexus is it Lexus is or Lexi

599
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,620
I wonder the Lexus is like

600
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,620
Well these automobiles

601
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,620
They got a lot of technology in it

602
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,620
And so of course going through their site

603
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,620
And looking in some of their cars

604
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,620
I saw that they

605
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,620
You know I actually remembered

606
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,620
They have that auto park system

607
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,620
So as they're trying out podcasting

608
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,620
Which of course I really appreciate

609
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,620
And they're jumping in head first

610
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,620
I think we should try out their car

611
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,620
Has anyone as any of you guys

612
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,620
Ever driven that that self park Lexus

613
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,620
Do you own one have you have you

614
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:50,620

Adam, here we go

624
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,620
One girl in casting

625
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,620
With Adam Curry

626
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,620
Hey Adam

627
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,620
F***ing ready to be stumps

628
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,620
I am good

629
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,620
He's the good test

630
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
With young pullback

631
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,620
God!

632
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,620
Adam hit test number 73

633
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,620
Three short snippets

634
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,620
And then three answers

635
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,620
So let's start right away

636
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,620
This is number one

637
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,620
Oh, y'all, come on man

638
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,620
He's trying to insult my intelligence here

639
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,620
It's a Holognox man, either

640
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,620
I recognize that one in any circumstances

641
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,620
Number two

642
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,620
I love this one

643
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,620
Yes, human league

644
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,620
Don't you want me?

645
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,620
Good songs, y'all

646
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,620
But not all that hard to recognize

647
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,620
And the final one, number three

648
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,620
I know it

649
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,620
I know you're sitting there with your buds

650
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,620
Jambed in saying

651
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,620
It's the patch up boys

652
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,620
Uh, type of the song I forgot

653
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,620
And that's it

654
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,620
This is answer number one

655
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,620
Boy, she comes

656
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,620
She's a man, either

657
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,620
And she's number one from 1982

658
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,620
All I know, some man either

659
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,620
I got that one right

660
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,620
And this is answer number two

661
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,620
Of course I had it right

662
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,620
Don't you want me?

663
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,620
You know I can't believe it

664
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,620
And I hear the truth

665
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,620
See me, don't

666
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,620
Don't you want me?

667
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,620
You want me?

668
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,620
And so number two from 1982 as well

669
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,620
The human league and don't you want me?

670
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,620
Number three

671
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,620
And this is the third answer

672
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Today's hit this

673
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,620
All time, what's the call for?

674
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,620
West

675
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,620
West name girls

676
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,620
I've been to boys from 1986

677
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,620
I've got to have a point for that

678
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,620
Sometimes you better off say

679
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,620
It doesn't come in here

680
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,620
I've sent

681
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,620
You're wasting time the damn world

682
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,620
You're wasting girls

683
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,620
You're wasting time the damn world

684
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,620
You're wasting time the damn world

685
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,620
You're wasting boys

686
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,620
And so number three today's hit this

687
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,620

766
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:26,500
me with thunder, there's thunder in our hearts, baby, so much hate for the ones we love

767
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:40,140
Tell me we both matter, don't we, you know, love will always come to me, you know me, love will always come to me

768
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:48,460
love, you know me, love will always come to me, love will always come to me , love will always come to me and steady all of a thing

769
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,380
get out in this warm, warm place

770
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,420
as it says astation and not a humility

771
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,860
we're going on a bad road for the BB

772
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,660
1A that fell down

773
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,860
is only Christ

774
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:03,920
I don't know what

775
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,140
is for a kameravan

776
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:28,140
Come on, darling, can we steal some more from you now?

777
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:36,140
Come on, darling, can we steal some more from you now?

778
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:44,140
Come on, darling, can we steal some more from you now?

779
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:51,140
It's just when it looks like it's been too late

780
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:57,140
We run up that road, run and I'm back

781
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:05,140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

782
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:17,140
You'll find your link to this track.

783
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,140
That is sourcecode.com, taking you to mashuptown.com.

784
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,140
It is DJ Magnet.

785
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,140
He's from Denver.

786
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,140
A beautiful mashup of placebo's cover running up that hill.

787
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:30,140
You also heard the original Kate Bush version in there along with the Pet Shop Boys.

788
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:35,140
Mashup for today's Daily Sourcecode, the maximum music Fubar Friday edition.

789
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:40,140
Of course, one other thing happened this past week which really made our schedules nuts, not just here,

790
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,140
but throughout the entire pod show organization.

791
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,140
We had a hack attack.

792
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:51,140
For those of you who haven't heard about it, a guy who calls himself monkey,

793
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:56,140
spelled backwards, got in somehow into some of our system.

794
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:01,140
And although most of our security measures locked him out, locked him in, isolated him,

795
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:11,140
he was able to send out basically a hack message to a significant number of email addresses that are associated with our members.

796
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:16,140
Now, when something like this happens, I got to tell you, this sucks so incredibly bad.

797
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:22,140
It's really, what a waste of energy, of time, of money.

798
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,140
Because, you know, well, if you're a really small company, then, you know, that's one thing.

799
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,140
But, you know, we're reasonably large.

800
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,140
We have over 100 people right now, worldwide.

801
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,140
And this shouldn't happen to us.

802
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,140
Of course, it shouldn't happen to anybody really.

803
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,140
And I've been through, you know, the past 20, 25 years.

804
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,140
I've been through this before.

805
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,140
Only never with a large base of customers.

806
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:51,140
And essentially, every single listener, every single podcaster, everyone who is working or using pod,

807
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,140
you're working with, they're using pod show, of course, is one of our customers.

808
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,140
So this really, really sucks, major league ass.

809
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,140
The entire engineering team has been working on this for the past few days.

810
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,140
They could have been doing a lot of other really productive things.

811
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:10,140
One of the things that we just really, you know, that I wanted to bring in a security expert.

812
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:14,140
Now, we've got guys who are very well versed in security.

813
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,140
And, you know, we did a huge move of all of our stuff to a new,

814
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,140
a new co-location.

815
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:27,140
And actually, you expect stuff to happen during a move like that, but this took place later.

816
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:33,140
Now, of course, I do know some of the details of what took place, which I obviously can't discuss here.

817
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:38,140
What we'll be happening is, you know, as I said, we're just going to have to get a security experts in.

818
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,140
That's the best thing we can do.

819
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,140
Have them do a full audit of the system compared to the audits that we have compared to all the,

820
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,140
and you still can't always get all of the information.

821
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,140
And it's just sad, you know, it really blows.

822
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:55,140
And it's just, it's counterproductive for everybody.

823
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,140
And by the way, I'd like to say to the, to the monkey guy who did this, you know,

824
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:07,140
complete amnesty dude, if you want to come clean and want to help us and lock up any holes that you think you see or anything you could exploit.

825
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:12,140
You know, you could do it in complete anonymity and, you know, we're not going to do anything with you.

826
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:16,140
But, you know, you really fucked this up and it would be nice if you could help us turn some of that back.

827
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,140
Because there's just a shitty perception. I really, really hate it.

828
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:24,140
And although it's, you know, this is probably the end of it.

829
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,140
You know, nothing, you know, there's like two philosophies.

830
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,140
Back in the day when I had MTV dot com.

831
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,140
People, you know, it was the perfect address.

832
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,140
I was maintaining it myself.

833
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,140
And there was no way I could thwart any of the attacks that were coming in.

834
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,140
So I just left it open.

835
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,140
And everyone you think people would come in, they'd roam around.

836
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:53,140
And of course, there was nothing on there, really, of any interest to them, except, you know, just basically some files that you could see publicly anyway.

837
00:43:53,140 --> 00:44:01,140
And often what would happen is they'd say, hey, you know, I opt to someone we're hacking to that it was a headless sun three computer that hack it and they say,

838
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,140
Oh, you know, while I was in here, I tightened up some stuff.

839
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:10,140
I put a new release of whatever software, you know, and that was cool.

840
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,140
I don't know.

841
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:20,140
I wonder what big, are there any other examples of big companies that have been through this or big or medium size companies?

842
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:28,140
Now, of course, the, the only thing of any real value to someone rummaging around our system would be, essentially, are our user names.

843
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,140
Our user name database.

844
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,140
And, of course, any information that's associated with that.

845
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:39,140
And we protect that with our lives and we encrypt that and we keep that in, in what I'm told is the, is the appropriate manners.

846
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,140
So there will be updates coming throughout the week.

847
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,140
A lot of you have questions about that.

848
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,140
And all I can say is we're incredibly sorry.

849
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:51,140
We're obviously a victim of this along with every, every customer of Pod Show.

850
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:56,140
And we're just going to, you know, being as open as we can about it.

851
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:01,140
You can't always communicate everything, as I said, for obvious reasons, security.

852
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:06,140
But I guess the best thing to do is, you know, have a independent audit done.

853
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,140
Take some recommendations from them.

854
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:15,140
And we should be hearing that I hope over the weekend, actually, that there will be able to send out an email to explain where we stand and where we're at.

855
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:18,140
So far, though, it seems like the damage is pretty limited.

856
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,140
Nothing has changed.

857
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,140
I use her pages.

858
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,140
Nothing has changed on the site.

859
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,140
Nothing has changed in our, in our core back end.

860
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,140
But through the mail server, a lot of emails were sent out.

861
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,140
Not everyone got them.

862
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,140
Some people got 20 or 30 emails.

863
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:37,140
And, um, man, that's, that's life.

864
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,140
Isn't it, though?

865
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:45,140
It's not all you had the chance to travel every major road in the USA.

866
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:53,140
Ever wondered what the real face of America looks like that's not from a glossy and fake manufacturer perspective?

867
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:58,140
Can't afford or don't have time to travel as much as you would like?

868
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:08,140
Come along with me, as I show you the more obscure parts of the USA and high definition Apple TV 720p video.

869
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:15,140
Check it out at trucker-tomhd.com, where HD stands for high definition.

870
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,140
Yeah, that stuff trucker-tom does is very cool.

871
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:24,140
You should see, it's like music videos, um, only of this beautiful country of ours.

872
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,140
And now that it's an HD, a lot of people do an HD.

873
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,140
Cali Lewis do an HD, room of girls doing HD.

874
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,140
I'm just seeing HD all over the place.

875
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:40,140
And I see a lot of people setting up separate feeds for HD versions of their shows so that it can go straight into Apple TV.

876
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,140
And other people who want to enjoy the HD experience.

877
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,140
And it really is pretty awesome.

878
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:49,140
Of course, we've, and we've had to up the limit of, of storage.

879
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,140
I think that's now been pushed through if not, you know, correct me.

880
00:46:52,140 --> 00:47:02,140
But I think that you can now upload, uh, quite a mess load of, uh, of, uh, megabytes, uh, in order to facilitate all of that HD material that's coming out.

881
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,140
But it's cool, man, because it's HD stuff.

882
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,140
It's clearly where everything is going.

883
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,140
Well, Swagadam.

884
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,140
That won't swagadam.

885
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,140
The Sheren.

886
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,140

DevaCast.potcho.com.

888
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,140
That's a couple of things.

889
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,140
When a Shweather shop, so povoo.

890
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:21,140
It's by Celine Mastorelli, and it's brand new to the Pod Save Music Network.

891
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:24,140
It's called Jiffa Passefois.

892
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,140
Oh, Jiffa Passefois.

893
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:28,140
And it means I don't want to know.

894
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,140
See you later.

895
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,140
See you later.

896
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,140
So, Fubar Friday.

897
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,140
Oh, wow.

898
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,140
My little divaCast.

899
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,140
Huh.

900
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,140
What's the story?

901
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,140
Yeah.

902
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,140
Yeah.

903
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,140
It's from the Pantheon Music Network.

904
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,140
You know, you just don't hear enough French songs under radio anymore.

905
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,140
So, man, it's what put it on the Charlie.

906
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:51,140
Jiffa Passefois, Celine Mastorelli.

907
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,140
Oh.

908
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,140
Oh.

909
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,140
Oh.

910
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,140
Oh.

911
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,140
I don't want to see you again.

912
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,140
Even if it's true, you're a piece of shit.

913
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,140
I don't want to see you.

914
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,140
I don't want to see you.

915
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,140
You're the Fantas, my little divaCist.

916
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,140
You love my own color.

917
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,140
It's not good for you, my little divaCist.

918
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:47,140
I don't want to see you, you don't want to see me.

919
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,240
Before I went

920
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,380
Before I went

921
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,380
Shouldi'd trade like Go

922
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,200
Choose bad stuff!

923
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:24,880
sounds messed up

924
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,500
I don't want time, I don't have the burn

925
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:37,040
I don't want to suffer

926
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,140
but you won't see me

927
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:44,140
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

928
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,140
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

929
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:53,140
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

930
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:58,140
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

931
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:03,140
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

932
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:08,140
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

933
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,140
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

934
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:44,140
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

935
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:48,140
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

936
00:50:48,140 --> 00:51:00,140
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

937
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,140
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

938
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:07,140
I'm afraid, I'm not afraid

939
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:12,580
Thank you to the divas from the diva cast, diva cast.com for turning me on to that one.

940
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,580
I love the france of shansong.

941
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,780
Again, you just don't hear enough of that stuff on the radio.

942
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:23,580
But you can hear it all over what we call podcasting, pho shizl.

943
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,620
Podsame Music Network is where you can find that dailysourcecode.com, of course, where

944
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,220
you can find link to that in the show notes.

945
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,220
Well, let's see into the interview.

946
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,220
Yeah, it's Friday.

947
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,220
It's Friday.

948
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:39,340
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, full about Friday and a final fun of the week.

949
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,740
Personal thought of the week.

950
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:48,420
You know, my mom passed away, July 2nd, 2006, one cancer, it was fucked up and not a nice

951
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,060
way to end.

952
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,980
And, you know, I have a lot of friends who listen to the show, who really helped me get through

953
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,980
that period.

954
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,860
And, you know, it's kind of coming up on the one-year anniversary and so you start to start

955
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,100
to think.

956
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:08,180
And it was my mom's, it would have been my mom's birthday a couple of weeks ago.

957
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:14,580
And I got a lovely card from one of her best friends, Brenda, who lives in New York City.

958
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:19,100
And it was just really nice, you know, I met her when I was like six years old or something.

959
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,700
And so I can vaguely remember.

960
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,020
I do know that she paid a visit to my mom before she passed away.

961
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,260
She traveled over to the Netherlands to see her.

962
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,540
And today I'm going to repay the favor.

963
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:34,540
I know she lives in New York, I was able to find her phone number and we're going to be

964
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:40,660
meeting for lunch today at the Harvard Club, which was her choice, that's very nice.

965
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:46,540
So my final thought of the week is really just going out to my mom.

966
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:51,660
And I want you guys to have a fantastic weekend, enjoy it, whether the weather is good,

967
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:57,860
or whether it's crap, just have a good time, you and your family.

968
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:02,300
And if you don't have your family near you, call them up and tell them you love it.

969
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:12,820
And on my shit, let me end the thought first.

970
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,820
Yeah, exactly.

971
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,820
I will talk to you on Monday.

972
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,620
I'll be in the Curry condo San Francisco for the next week.

973
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:21,060
We're going to have a lot of fun and we're going to just, we're going to have fun.

974
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,060
I promise you, meet me Monday.

975
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,060
Bye.
