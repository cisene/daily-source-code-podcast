1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey, Adam, man, hey, this is Alman, yeah, I live up under the overpass and San Francisco.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You know, I was there when the day you had to put that bag over your head to save your hair on the day we're raining.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We don't mean we could consider ourselves kind of financially challenged, but I heard about this bum rush, the charts thing.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, me and the guys were thinking, if there's any money to be made, we'd be happy to volunteer to rush the charts for you.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You know, because, you know, we just want to get a little something to drink and I'll say, and come on, Adam give us a chance.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You know, on the DSC 567, let us know how we can rush the charts for you.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
bum rush the charts. I like that. I have a financially challenged bum rush in the chart.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There's $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know if it is bum rush the charts thing is all about, but you boys, but I put those charts back the way you found the way you're all dumber from tomorrow.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You can't do it's rush rush rush rush.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There's a place I used to go.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There's a world I used to know.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
There was a light under it was you.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There are everything I say it's true I say.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There will be day. I will win.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There will be day. I will win.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Doesn't they all find again?

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I will not know.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will will dances.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I will close, I will open.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's nobody around me.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can see it dressed in red

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
All the secrets things you said

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can see it dressed in red

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I and barefoot in the grass

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000

Every day, I'll always tell you my love again

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll know that every day, till you're mine again

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There's no words to explain, no beginning, no end

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will dream, I will pray, you will be right again

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll know that every day, till you're mine again

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll know that every day, till you're mine again

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There's no words to explain, no beginning, no beginning

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll know that every day, till you're mine again

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll know that every day, till you're mine again

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There's no words to explain, no beginning, no end

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I will dream, I will pray, you will be right again

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There's no words to explain, no beginning, no end

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I will dream, I will pray, you will be right again

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll know that every day, till you're mine again

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll know that every day, till you're mine again

45
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll know that every day, till you're mine again

46
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll be right again

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Blacklab, mine again, on March 22, the official bum rock the charts date

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
First, I code episode number 567, coming to you from the afloan suburb of Surinone

50
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Gilford run the westside of Gtown

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It is the curry manner

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,480
to my attic on the third floor.

53
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,320
Ah man, I'm still messing with the sound.

54
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,520
I got a lot of complaints from people who say that it's all, well, messed up, essentially.

55
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,120
Ever since I, this is me off, ever since I, I leave everything here perfectly and then

56
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,280
I come back and the mix has been unplugged and this is Yamaha Alpha Whiskey 16 golf is just,

57
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,000
it's an impossible mixer to save all your states perfectly.

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, apologies and advance.

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,440
Anyway, today of course, bum rusted charts.

60
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,560
You've been hearing about it on this show, you've been hearing about it on a plethora

61
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,040
of podcasts around the world.

62
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,720
In fact, this seems to be a much more global event than I even expected to check out

63
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,560
the promos coming in today.

64
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,840
This is a message from least trying listeners of the Daily Source Code.

65
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
You might've heard about bum rusted charts.

66
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
You may wonder how you can get involved.

67
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,040
It's quite simple.

68
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,080
Simply, go to iTunes Music Store or Australia.

69
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,840
Pay a dollar 69.

70
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,920
Download money again by Black Lab.

71
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,480
Not only would you get a grize song, you'd be trying.

72
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,120
They traditionally really pay for that way, main business.

73
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
Yeah, kind of an abrupt ending there.

74
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,680
Oh, yeah.

75
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,480
So let me just quickly explain the concept.

76
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,080
And then as you can imagine, there's a lot of people who've sent in stuff who are calling in

77
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,120
about bum rusted charts.

78
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,840
So today we'll be more or less about bum rusted charts.

79
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
However, I have to say I'm quite happy.

80
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,200
Not everyone is, you know, there's some people asking questions.

81
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,560
There are some contrarian views.

82
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,680
So I like that because, well, it gives us something to talk about from multiple angles.

83
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,160
So the concept here was to see if the podcasting audiences who are

84
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,520
clued into this, if we could actually make a song go to number one on the iTunes chart.

85
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,760
And as far as we know, this is actually, you know, this is how kind of loosely

86
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,960
organized this whole thing is we don't even know how the iTunes charts are really compiled.

87
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,280
You know, I presume that they're compiled based upon download sales.

88
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,600
Actually, I looked at it this morning.

89
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,280
Let me see what is on top now.

90
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Beyonce and Shakira, beautiful liar.

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,840
Number one, Fergi with glamorous number two, A-Con.

92
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,760
I don't even know that fucking song.

93
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,680
The hell, can I play a preview on my allowed to do that?

94
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Let me just say, that's iTunes still.

95
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,320
You do that stuff.

96
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,360
We don't vibe, we don't vibe.

97
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,760
All right.

98
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,160
Okay, Avril Lavigne.

99
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,480
Number four with girlfriend and then we get Jim class heroes with

100
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
Cubid's chokehold.

101
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,880
I'm telling you man, this shit here I've never heard of before in my life.

102
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,560
Well, I do like this quince to find the song.

103
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,280
That's kind of cool.

104
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,040
That's cool.

105
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,400
Anyway, so presumably this chart is compiled based upon based upon purchases

106
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,760
through the iTunes music store.

107
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,920
That's what everyone presumes.

108
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,520
That makes a lot of sense, obviously.

109
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,400
So it was kind of like a social experiment to see if we could get one particular

110
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,000
track one song onto the chart and up the chart, hence the bum rush, the chart idea.

111
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,400
And if you want to find out more about that, you can go to bum rushthecharts.com

112
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,000
and all the informations there.

113
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,760
So Black Lab, the song you just heard, mine again was chosen as the track that we're all going to

114
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,640
go out and buy today.

115
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,240
I've already bought my copy for 99 cents downloaded perfectly.

116
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,920
In fact, what you heard was the copy that I downloaded from iTunes.

117
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,640
And the way you do it is you go to either bum rushthecharts.com where you can go to the show

118
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,880
notes for the daily source code at dailysourcecode.com and you'll see a link there.

119
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,680
And from there you click on the big ass.

120
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,240
I'm talking about big ass blue iTunes button.

121
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,680
You can barely miss it.

122
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,960
It's at the top of the page.

123
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,560
There's also some explanation there because it's an affiliate link, a good portion of the proceeds of

124
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:15,160
this campaign, I should call it, is going to help kids get through school, through scholarship funds,

125
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,720
of course, Chris from the Financial Aid podcast is involved.

126
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,040
So you know where that came from and that just makes it that much more interesting as a social

127
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,560
experiment because we're doing some good.

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,640
However, the actual reasons and what we're trying to prove with this, I think has become a little

129
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,520
bit misconstrued and I have to say Eric Bergen, who of course is my buddy from the Jersey Boy

130
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,960
San Francisco version called in and and had I think exactly the right question.

131
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,280
So I'm going to play this for it's kind of a long comment, but I it's worth it because with all

132
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,280
this euphoria about bum rushthecharts and actually I should just say before we get to that

133
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,720
that the well maybe I should hold it to laughter but the news reports, the amount of reporting in

134
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:06,440
mainstream media San Jose Mercury news did a piece I believe today were in the Washington

135
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:13,720
Post with bum rushthecharts and you know that that's some I couldn't actually read the

136
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,440
Washington Post yeah I had to go register I'm so tired of registering for news if I just

137
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,240
wait a little bit I'll get a copy of it from somewhere else. Eric hey Adam it's Eric Bergen

138
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,840
from the San Francisco cast of Jersey Boys sending in an audio comment not about Jersey Boys

139
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,920
believe it or not. Well the second part is the first first part I want to ask, did you see us on

140
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,640
what do you think? Okay dude I did not see you on Leno because I live in the UK and I forgot to

141
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:44,680
set the the Tvo the sky digital thing I'm sorry. Is it on YouTube yet or Google I did hear from Brian

142
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:50,520
know from the nose on the you guys kicked whole ass so when Brian says it then he you know it's true

143
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:56,920
so didn't see it love to see it congratulations love you mean it. Let me tell you it was the coolest

144
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,280
thing ever it was out of this world wild okay anyway ever mind the second thing this is why I'm

145
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,840
sending in this audio comment I want to talk about this bum rush the charts thing here's my

146
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:14,520
problem with it well first off let me say I'm not associated with bum rush the charts I don't know

147
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:21,240
anyone who's putting it together I'm unrelated in in every way possible all it and let me just say on

148
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,520
that Eric everybody is unrelated in every way possible um this is not a pod show promotion this is

149
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,320
uh as far as I know I think Chris from financial aid podcast Mark Yoshimoto Namcoff I think those

150
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,880
are probably the two main drivers behind this but this is not anything you know it's not like an

151
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,760
official thing just kind of started which I love so much because those are usually the most beautiful

152
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,520
when something just kind of starts and we all just kind of want to go and do some all I know is the

153
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:55,880
information that has been given on jelly source code as well as other podcasts right okay yeah

154
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,840
here's my feeling on the bum rush the charts thing I think it's a I think it's a cool idea and I

155
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:10,520
it's something that um I think is a noble effort but and please correct me if I'm wrong so let me

156
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:17,720
oh Eric don't worry you know I will let me state this not as a problem but let me state this as a

157
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:25,160
question a let me just play devil's advocate here while I think it's a cool idea and I think it's

158
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:36,440
absolutely a a obviously it's good natured I'm unclear as to how this bum rush the charts project

159
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:45,240
proves that pod casting is a powerful force in media oh no boy I care for now

160
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:54,760
because that's exactly what it proves but the reasons why well let there continue so we've already proven

161
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,200
that the podcasting is a powerful force because Billboard magazine picks up the story or picked

162
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:06,200
up the story excuse me about the bum rush the charts project that already happened so we know that

163
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:16,680
it's a powerful situation however it's not as though you just played this black lab song on your podcast

164
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,840
and people liked it's so much that they went out and bought it either on iTunes or the

165
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:29,240
music network or whatever it's not like all these people that it's not like pod castors all

166
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,840
to sort of discover the song started playing it and people loved it so much that it shot to the

167
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,000
top of the charts okay let's I just want to interrupt Eric here because he's getting into something

168
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,640
very important um you're absolutely right however if you believe if you truly believe that the

169
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:55,720
way records get to the top of the chart in either let's just say the billboard chart as the quintessential

170
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,040
example you know that's not because people heard the song it's because the machine kicked into motion

171
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:11,560
and this machine look we know now for a fact it's been proven that as recent as 2000 to 2002 I

172
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:18,520
believe Payola was going on with some of the largest radio broadcast companies and some of the

173
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:24,680
largest music companies it's the way it works it's like you know there's there's tons and tons and tons

174
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:31,720
of great music I having I come from top 40 radio I come from MTV I know how this works they're all

175
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,000
just cogs in the wheel of this great machine which is all based upon making money which is fantastic

176
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:43,080
I love making money but because of the limited resources which is what broadcast mainstream broadcasting

177
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:49,640
is all about is limited it's you know is is having a piece of space on a limited shelf you know

178
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,360
there are only so many frequencies only the people who have lobbied and have made it their business

179
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,080
to acquire these frequencies have the frequencies and can make money off of it which makes it seem

180
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,840
unfair that there's so much great music out there that only a sliver of it actually gets through

181
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,560
to the public so all right and but how it gets through the public is not because the public is

182
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,280
saying play this for me no the machine is playing it for you and by the way it's literally a

183
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,960
fucking machine it's a computer that is spinning out playlists across the the clear channel

184
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:26,440
empire of stations you know it's programmed it's it's spreadsheet business almost so yeah it's

185
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,960
you know these independent promoters look I know this business that you know this here's $40,000

186
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,600
you know and I'm expecting 12 spins a week for it that's and that's probably not enough but

187
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,600
that's exactly how it works and you know there's no contracts but you know there's shadow stuff

188
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,520
and it's just it's okay I'm not I'm not against it it's uh it's their businesses what they do we have

189
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:55,000
a totally different business so the mechanics of what's going on here is showing something very different

190
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,960
is showing that yes you may have that very expensive very well-oiled very fine tuned machine

191
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,040
which works in conjunction with the music business by the way not all radio of course works in

192
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,120
conjunction with the music business and you know and and and rules and regulations and and payoffs

193
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,720
and payments and licenses and all kinds of stuff and I think what we're about the proof here is that

194
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:25,720
we have a machine too okay now I do have to say that when songs are played on podcast they do

195
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,680
move product absolutely when songs are played on college radio people go out and and look for

196
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,680
these songs even if they're not available through a major label so any type of promotion you do is

197
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:45,400
always going to move the needle um there is in the way podcasting works it's uh because everyone

198
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,480
is kind of their own entity their own show their own network and you know they can do whatever they want

199
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,000
there's no you know forced you know there's no funnel effect that makes everyone play one song at the same

200
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,400
time unless you specifically get set out to do it so this is more showing that we have a machine

201
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:08,280
as well and um it's have you ever done something to someone just a fuck with them have you ever done

202
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:16,760
that you know just a you know what do they call it here in the UK uh are you winding me up that's

203
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,520
it are you winding me up it's a wind up basically it's a shot across the bow I guess and what's

204
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,680
so I'll tell you what's so interesting about it to me after we continue with Eric because he's

205
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,600
under something good here this black lab song if this bummer us the charts project doesn't

206
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,840
do you work and a song gets to number one the only reason it has gotten to number one is because

207
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,200
and I don't want to say you I don't mean you but you you the the podcaster or whoever

208
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,760
goes out and promotes the bummer us the charts project is telling the audience what to do

209
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,280
the audience is going to do it because they want to take part in this project because it it's

210
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,360
cool moving what they do what they love works yes and it's about yes thank you exactly and that's

211
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,600
what it's supposed to prove we know that if you have a machine and you put a quarter in the top

212
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,200
that a dollar is supposed to roll out of the bottom that's what the the music industry machine has

213
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:22,200
been for many many years um let's just say they've had a they've had a Mercedes 500 you know

214
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,680
SEL or whatever and they're cruising down the road and I think all we're doing is saying hey

215
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:34,520
hey hey hey record industry we've got a interesting car over here as well it's um well

216
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,200
it's it's the color of baby crap and it runs on biodiesel but you know it's a car and it's working

217
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,240
and it's the understand the metaphor that's really what it's about and by the way we're all in the

218
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:53,000
car together okay this proves the power of the audience so this is not about podcasters you know

219
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,080
but I have a ton of songs that I'd love to be number one on the iTunes music charts but

220
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,800
it's never gonna happen or not in the foreseeable future because my audience probably just isn't

221
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,440
large enough to have a percentage of people go and do that going by that song but it does show that

222
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:14,200
there is power and um that we actually have a way of kind of harnessing that and we do have a way

223
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,720
of grouping together and doing stuff you know what I mean if you had uh for instance that lower

224
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,960
clap song or the pit hop console uh if those songs were an iTunes and you played it and some

225
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:33,800
other podcasters also played it and that many people heard it and then they loved it that much

226
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:41,800
that they went out and bought it that would prove it I'm unclear as to how this someone telling

227
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:48,200
someone what to buy by saying this is the song you have to buy this is gonna prove something

228
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,400
this is going to prove that pod casting is powerful well I think it's a great idea I'm just

229
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,760
unclear as to it's not because it's not coming from an actual creative uh it's not coming from an

230
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,240
audience member or an audience that actually just wants to listen to the song it's coming from

231
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,960
this rule or this this rule of this project I don't see how it's actually a uh how it actually

232
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,920
proves that pod casting is a powerful force and media so I just would love to know your thoughts on

233
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,920
that and and why I'm wrong okay all right I appreciate it I really do so the reason why it's

234
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,880
to me this this has already been proven it it already works and it's not because of the press

235
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,600
and it's uh and we don't even have to go to number what we don't have to hit the chart at all

236
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,200
what has already happened I believe I told you this yesterday is that two major labels one of

237
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,240
the largest independent labels and one of the uh a label the belongs to one of the big four

238
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,400
have contacted me directly and personally and said quote I really love this bum rush the chart's

239
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,160
idea could you do it for one of our artists do you understand the significance of that this is the

240
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,000
music that we're not allowed to play we're not allowed to play I mean independent uh label is

241
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,280
a little different but I you know I'm just bringing that in to show that you know once you're big

242
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,360
and once you're growing and and money's coming in that uh you know capitalism kicks in and even

243
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,560
the independent guys they're into to make money what do you think they just want to try and

244
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,360
make it on different terms however both of them set exactly the same thing how can you can you

245
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:26,200
organize this for one of our artists and I'm thinking of myself okay I love this because if we can

246
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:34,840
make this happen uh and already have the major uh players in an well established uh decade old decades

247
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,520
old industry uh come up and say hey wait a minute there's something going on here we have already

248
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,360
moved the needle we really have if you take all of the things together I believe that this will in

249
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:53,160
some way probably affect what podcasters can do I it may actually turn the tables it may open up music

250
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:01,160
to uh you know I'm most interested in back catalog I always find that an incredible shame and

251
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:08,760
a travesty literally that uh I can't play um back catalog stuff from 20 years ago stuff from 30

252
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:15,720
years ago stuff from 50 years ago I cannot share that with a new audience who I know for fact go out

253
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,760
and actually buy albums and get interested and buy more songs so this is about showing an industry

254
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:29,080
that we're here that we're relevant and it shows a whole massive industries what we're capable of

255
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:36,520
now do I hope that one day um a song will become so popular which I just don't see how it can actually

256
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:44,680
happen but that we would collectively through audience um demand that songs would start to sell

257
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:51,400
particular songs yeah of course you know if I had an audience of 10 million uh or maybe 20 million

258
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:57,160
I'm sure I could do it all by myself just by by repetition it's how we buy things people buy

259
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,120
things because media tells them to buy things make no mistake look at the commercials they're telling

260
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:08,360
you they literally say go buy it now get to one free buy it get to three for the price of two

261
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,200
this is being and by the way we threaten in commercials if you don't buy this product you will never

262
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,760
get laid if you don't buy this product you'll get pimples and you'll never get laid it's all

263
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:24,040
it always comes back to not getting laid trust me that's how advertising works it's what media

264
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,600
as a party if you don't watch this news you will die just watch the six o'clock news you need to

265
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,440
watch this because there's something poisonous in the air that will kill you stay tuned we're

266
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,400
gonna do it in 20 minutes almost near the end of the broadcast you know hey how can you not become

267
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,280
fucked up like Britney Spears I mean this is what media has become commercial media

268
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,520
so it's they were playing on the same terms and it's very exciting to me because it's such a small

269
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:55,320
it's 99 cents it's nothing and look at the automation of it look at our machine look at how

270
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,800
that's put together this is going to register with people and as I said it already has

271
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:07,160
and I'm really fucking proud of it actually so bum rush the charts dot com or you can go to

272
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,400
the show notes for daily source code dot com for this particular podcast you're listening to

274
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:26,040
going to help kids get scholarships and and help show that we have a machine okay it's it's built

275
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:32,760
up of all different pieces but we do have a machine little pause there for these serious satellite

276
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,000
radio listeners as they yes which stuff boy are they missing some shit huh having someone

277
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,880
looking over your shoulder when you're trying to make art suck hi this is Dave Jackson from the

278
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,040
musicians cool and if you're a musician that's just been dreaming of getting that big record deal

279
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,280
then you've got to come listen to the latest addition of the musicians core podcasts where we

280
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:56,360
interview Paul Durham of the band black lab he spills the beans on the music business it's been a year

281
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,720
of a life a year and a half of their life the how many years they spend writing it's all how many years

282
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,640
of this band working and sweating blood over those songs giving those songs getting those songs to

283
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,360
the point where they were first class to make it the best possible rendition of them and then

284
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:18,360
the label decided well we need to need a christening egg yellow effect this month and so we're just

285
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,360
going to put this on the show be sure to go to bum rush the charts on March 22 let's help put Paul

286
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,520
and black lab on the top of the iTunes charts then check out the interview in musicians cooler.com

287
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:38,040
yo yeah you may be surprised but what he has to say remember black lab had a mainstream

288
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,960
big record label deal they were dropped they fought to get their songs back and now they're

289
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,200
sharing them with the world and making them the first input and output of the machine that

290
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,160
we're proving does exist it's the machine of you the audience this is not podcasters this is the

291
00:25:53,160 --> 00:26:00,840
audience okay and by the way audience you you people there all over the world you can put the link

292
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,480
on your weblog as well you know you can put it anywhere you want and you can participate it

293
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:11,400
is about you showing that you can make happen what you want to have happen you know so if we have

294
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,640
tens of thousands of people buying this song you know yeah a thousand people will buy different songs

295
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,080
when they hear them on podcasts and it may not move the charts but it is happening it's for real

296
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,480
I will talk about other stuff today besides bum rush the chart at promise

297
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:34,600
from rush the charts can can we buy them the UK or not I don't know be useful if I know because

298
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:42,920
I wouldn't mind you know doing something this and just right yeah of course you can and it will

299
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,760
there's a separate chart I believe for the UK for every territory every country there's a separate

300
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,040
chart so please keep your eye on your local chart and let me know if you see any movement or anything at

301
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:58,920
all actually let me um let me just check out iTunes right now this thing doesn't refresh automatically

302
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,080
is that I thought there was a webpage where you could check this stuff out but I guess I'm wrong I have to

303
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:11,880
go into iTunes specifically every single time let me see uh what do I look for under the M and uh nothing

304
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:19,640
look I bought it I know I know I registered for one vote oh man

305
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:28,200
hey there's so much uh excitement about Twitter I don't know if you've seen this or try to

306
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:35,400
yourself I I did register and I immediately I almost immediately turned it off and and I realized as I was

307
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:42,280
listening to the latest tweet it's a tweet 91 which I still haven't finished listening to that

308
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,640
uh the reason why this I think this is exploding is because it is the quintessential app that has

309
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:55,240
suddenly shown Americans specifically Americans what SMS text messaging is all about you know

310
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:05,880
for Europeans uh and UK of course proud member of the EU uh but yeah we've been text messaging for years

311
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,720
for years it is part of our culture I text message with Patricia and it's always been amazing to me

312
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:17,400
how how few people use this in the United States mainly because a lot of the cell phone services

313
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:26,120
in the early days were not I'm not entirely sure of the technical details of this but I know

314
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,960
that they did not use the GSM protocol which I believe also includes the SMS you know the short messaging

315
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:38,440
service and and by the way it's it's become what do you call you know how you don't search for

316
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,880
something you Google something so you don't you know send a message to someone through your cell

317
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:51,080
phone and so I'm gonna send you an SMS I'm gonna SMS you which is kind of hot and so I believe

318
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:58,120
that this is all of a sudden has shown uh people in the US the text messaging is really useful

319
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,760
and really really cool for short messages which is exactly what it is but you know the idea

320
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,960
being able to send a group SMS I mean that's that's kind of like built into my phone already you

321
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,920
know now of course this is the opposite of of me determining who's going to receive

322
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,280
it's more of a published subscribe mechanism which of course is is fantastic for the blogger's

323
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,200
fear because everyone's like wow it's just like a weblog and of course there is just like a weblog only

324
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:29,000
with a very specific use but for me the signal to noise ratio on Twitter forget about it I use

325
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,840
my SMS text messaging for business you know I do not want all kinds of shit cluttering up my

326
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,200
inbox and besides that it's annoying you know unless you use your your text message unless you

327
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,960
don't use your text messaging and you know you check it like your email once once or twice a day

328
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,800
and then go through all the Twitter things you know then it makes a lot of sense and you can have

329
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,800
some fun with it but this is you know it's like when someone really needs to get me a message

330
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,320
whether it's my family or whether it's my business associates you know SMS text messaging pretty much

331
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,200
assures that I'm going it's not like an email in fact it is the better version of an email because

332
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,800
it costs money in some cases I think it even costs money to receive text messaging depending

333
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,160
on where you receive I think if you are roaming in another country it will cost you money to receive

334
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:23,880
a text message it definitely always costs money to send one from your phone but I like it very

335
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,200
much for for that very reason because the stuff I get on there I consider to be of high value

336
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,560
because someone has my personal number first of all so I've given them that or they they may have

337
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,760
gotten it from somewhere else but I've given them that they're going to be identified when they send

338
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,480
their message yeah you can spoof it and all that stuff but it's great you know I love it so I

339
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,920
I hate having a whole bunch of noise in there that is just in fact I only follow one Twitter

340
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:56,600
account and that's a comic strip blogger I found that an an I unbefriended everybody I you know

341
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,840
I've sent one or two messages and I'm like now I don't this not for me it really isn't because

342
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,880
I don't want to be a one way street if I'm if I'm communicating in some type of protocol so I

343
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,120
don't want it to be only send no receive and then I'm just not going to send because I got to

344
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,960
get that's a clean channel for me I don't want it to I don't want it to pollute it in any way

345
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,400
I just wanted to point that out as an observation that and I also I don't know if Twitter is

346
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,160
catching fire as much in the rest of the world as it is in the in the US but I think it's good because now

347
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:37,960
finally people in the States understand how incredibly convenient and reliable SMS messaging is

348
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:45,320
SMSing. SMSing. Hey look who's here is the candy man. Hi Adam it's Luke your

349
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:54,440
800 BFF splinter go daddy. Hey listen I'm sure that this rum rush to charge is very important but

350
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:03,400
I would like to talk about something else. My colleague Phil from the UK is going on a week long trip

351
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,360
through the Sahara on on Sunday and while you may think what's special about that but

352
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:16,680
actually what he will be doing together with his partner Susie is to run full length marathon

353
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,880
every day so they are going to run a full marathon through this haira desert every day next week

354
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,680
and they are doing that to support a charity in the UK which is helping kids with the

355
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:38,440
learning disability starting that's pretty important charity for you know to give kids a good start

356
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:45,560
in education and so yeah I could send you the links to their website so I mean it's

357
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:52,120
difficult to explain those of a voicemail comment and I hope that you and your listeners could

358
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:59,240
have a look and maybe give their support to the charity. Hey Luke are you calling from the bathroom man

359
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,800
sounds like you're in the loop. On the website you can you can follow where they are

360
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:13,160
you can send them also some emails to support them through the website and the email will be printed

361
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,360
out and they will go to their tent I understood so that it's something even my assistant is not doing

362
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,840
so I think it's pretty amazing I mean I'm already out of breath if I walk two flights of stairs here

363
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:32,840
into PowerPoint Palace and let alone run a full-time full length marathon every day in this

364
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,920
haira desert so I hope I hope we could all support that that's what and thanks in advance for

365
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:44,360
all your support thanks by Luke. You can tell Luke's in sales man it's pretty funny talking about the

366
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:50,600
powerpoint palace you know that shit is I think I saw Jack Osborn when he had a series where he was

367
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:56,360
doing the unbelievable things with his new tone down body and his new healthy spirit in mind and

368
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:03,400
he I think he did one of those tracks and he did the first day and I mean and he he just couldn't

369
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,840
continue maybe he did a little bit of the second day but this this literally kills people there

370
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:15,640
people die on this it's an amazing track so I just can't believe I can't believe someone would do it

371
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:20,680
as shit man is like can I just send let me just send money all right please send me those links Luke

372
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:26,520
because I I want to just send money for the kids I'm way too lazy and I like life way too much to

373
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,600
participate and something like that but hats off to those guys they got my attention for sure

374
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:37,000
which of course is exactly why you do stuff like that but man that's that's no joke I loop by the way

375
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,600
who turned me on to something called the cloud in London it's actually in the UK but it's

376
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:53,080
really prevalent in London it's this blanketing Wi-Fi network which is nothing super new and of

377
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,480
course you know don't please don't send me all the comments about phone and all those yeah yeah and

378
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,280
but what I did like about or what I do like about the cloud is that you don't log in to an access

379
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,640
point every single time with the any hundred you basically look up the MAC address that's the

380
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:15,080
the physical ethernet adapter it has it's kind of like an IP address only for the one layer

381
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:21,720
down in the stack for the for the hardware and any of those is just as unique as an IP address

382
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:29,400
or even more unique as an IP address I should say and it and and the minute your device in this

383
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,320
case I'm using the the the internet tablet the n800 the minute it goes searching for an access

384
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,280
point and it hits the the cloud the Wi-Fi zone the cloud I think is what it's called it's going

385
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,080
to automatically register log on any kind of course then do stuff it updates my news aggregators

386
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:51,160
a built-in news aggregator but yesterday so you understand the concept right it's like 995 maybe

387
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,920
that's a promotional offer but I think it's 995 a month is really it's not a lot of money

388
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,920
check it out at the train station boom it kicked in

389
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:06,120
run and I were having lunch boom it kicked in even at the office I was getting a Wi-Fi

390
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,560
access point from the cloud it wasn't even using the office access point didn't even know it

391
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,600
and here was the cool thing we went to have some lunch at the hawkston which is a hawkston hotel

392
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:22,120
it took fabulous hotel by the way which is right across the road from the crash pad and shortage

393
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,920
and and they have free Wi-Fi so you know and I've already been there before so it automatically

394
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:36,840
connected we had a conference call and it took Ron I think a good five or eight minutes maybe

395
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,400
to call in through his cell phone was having trouble getting the carrier getting a signal inside

396
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,920
the building and and as often happens you know you go through you have to dial all these

397
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,200
extra long numbers because 800 numbers sometimes are recognized and meanwhile I had already

398
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,960
dialed in and I was listening to the fabulous hold music in when I'm stereo but through two

399
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,800
head you know two ear buds because that's what comes with the 800 is two ear buds in a microphone

400
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,800
two ear buds in the microphone and I was already on mutant ready to go for free no cost

401
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:23,800
I love it let me see I speak in of unbelievable things we're achieving with music podcasting

402
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,320
you're Adam it's good in Seattle I wanted to let you know that I am driving home from work

403
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:37,560
listening to a metal band from Ecuador and you are solely responsible for that I just want to

404
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,400
point out the impact all of your years of action and working for people who enjoy media

405
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:49,160
have taken and I really appreciate that this is awesome you rock. Oh man I'm actually I'm quite

406
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,200
lame but I really appreciate you saying that because that that is entirely what it's about and

407
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,440
I told you when I played that song in Pablo from Ecuador called Pablo from Escobar and Pablo from

408
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,480
Ecuador called in and said you know dude here's a metal band they've had some number one hits

409
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,040
and they're really big here and and I played it and I was a little apprehensive because I don't

410
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,960
play a lot of metal on the show and then I realized like who cares who cares if you don't like

411
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:23,320
it you're just going to fast forward it's no big deal yeah man it's working absolutely it is working

412
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,520
love it

413
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,120
he had his he had the phone number programmed into his phone which is something I recommend you do

414
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,680
I'm going to give you these numbers with a handy little jingle which will haunt you

415
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,240
throughout the rest of your day as you'll be singing this over and over again the point is put this

416
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:48,440
into your cell phone right now and use the plus so you know you could do oh oh if you're in the

417
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:55,080
state you could do 01144 but just do plus four four well if you're in the US it's going to be

418
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,880
plus one and trust me you just want to do it because you're going to find yourself one day in some

419
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,520
area that's not going to understand just the 201 or the 10201 put the plus in front of it

420
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,440
it's different on all phones how to get the plus sign but please do it and here's that jingle that's

421
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,880
going to haunt you forever

422
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,560
just looking at the the time here almost 40 minutes I got a hurry up we got the

423
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
dinner with Dr. Cockney tonight

424
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,520
all right is it embedded in your brain yet

425
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,120
Adam Hi Charles I would just want to do a bit of always for us that does the

426
00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:02,920
put your own light the female UK voice because I like a voice I'd come out I might want to

427
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:10,040
maybe use her on or or not at least it's like a real phone her yeah I think

428
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:17,480
male foot man yeah yeah let me just say something about those are the tags that we have

429
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,280
at the end of every show that come out of the UK it's interesting you say that because there was

430
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:28,760
quite a discussion we auditioned number of voices I have no idea who they are I did at one point

431
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,120
but I don't know anymore it's not really not important because I was just listening to the voices

432
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:37,000
listening to the reads and I said hey I really like this voice and I got a lot of pushback people

433
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:45,080
saying well you know is it no I got a feeling that I don't know and maybe it's maybe it's not a

434
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:52,120
stereotypical you know media voice or something you it's just I really liked it it happens with a lot

435
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:58,840
of stuff that I don't know I think that one of the things I pride myself on is I think I can spot

436
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:07,080
product and media and talent that I believe will resonate with an audience and it resonated with you

437
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,360
and I appreciate it I'll find out who it is now let you know if you want a caller for or something

438
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:17,160
for yourself remember it's voice work only okay I hope you're getting the right idea here

439
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,040
so they come and say to me I'm something that made me laugh she said you're the food bar boy

440
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,480

442
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:36,280
getting out there because don't see your personal personal secret email address but of course the

00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,760
domain I've got to call the Google peeps because I'm having some trouble with my MX records

445
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,520
yes it's a very long story you don't want to hear about it's a curry dot com still isn't fixed

451
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,120
charge stay I wanted to let you know that for the first time ever I'm featuring a musician on food

452
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:32,360
philosophy I found bohal on the pot safe music network and I've used his music ever since because

453
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:38,200
I just love it and you've played him a couple of times too on the DSC so I was happy to hear that you

454
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:45,400
found him and he and I had a chance to talk about that and also the sassy rhythms of food and music

455
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:51,320
so you can check that out at foodphilosophy.podshow.com and I also wanted to address

456
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:58,120
Mark Yoshimoto Namcoff's comment on the power of new media because that really hit home for me

457
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,600
since chef Mark and I started the culinary podcast network to take back food media and to

458
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:10,440
feature the kind of content we wanted to hear and see so we are with you all the way and we are so proud
