1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey Adam, it's me, 4.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You know, 4.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The number that comes right after...

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, 3?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah, I want to...

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What is this?

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You know, even a 3-year-old knows it's 1, 2, 3, 4.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay, it's in my contract.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Whenever 3 comes and music's being played, I come along too.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, you know what?

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm going to do...

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You've got to show coming up, 6, 24?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, let's make it 6, 23 again.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We have that 6, 21, 6, 22.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
1, 2, 1, 2, whatever you want to call it, okay?

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But it's not going to be 6, 24.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You've got to wait 10 more shows to give me a bag.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You've got to own my trust because I'm a little ticked off right now.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You know, 1, 2, 3, no 4.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You know, I'm twice the man that 2 is.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But no, you keep saying 2, 2, 2, 2.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
On the DSC, 6, 20.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, see?

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Seems a little blank without me, 4.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Soundtrack, what's pot to be?

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, I ain't no.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I go about a name off.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
A little baby has gold.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Rip it sit in that first thing.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Fifteen.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
In this and right here.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I dedicate this and right here.

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To all my homies out there, grind it.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We all stand legally and illegally.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Check it out.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Check it out.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Check it out.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
First guy that way, he was 6, didn't know when he traced.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Matter of fact.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
First time he got on it.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He slept.

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Left it on his hip band.

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He busted his lip.

51
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Before we could have a talk with a list like this.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now we're getting the story right here.

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But shorty didn't quit.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It was something in the air.

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah.

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
When they said it's getting late.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So sorry young man.

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's not skate in.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Some kick.

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Push, kick.

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Push, kick.

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Push, kick.

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Push, kick.

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Push, kick.

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And a way.

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Roll just around the world.

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And a place to go.

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And so we kick.

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And a gun.

71
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And a post.

72
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And a post.

73
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And a post.

74
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And a post.

75
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wicked out.

76
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't let them change.

77
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah.

78
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't let them change.

79
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Or even.

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Raise your hands.

81
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah.

82
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't let them change.

83
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't let them change.

84
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't let them change.

85
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't let them change.

86
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah.

87
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Don't let them change.

88
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah.

89
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't let them change.

90
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're not saying.

91
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't let them change.

92
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't, let them change.

93
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't let them change.

94
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah.

95
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't let them change.

96
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,500
Yeah.

97
00:02:48,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Oh, no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

98
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:48,500
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

99
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,500
We've been trying to scare

100
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Go now

101
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:23,100
The perfect way to kick off the Tuesday, Episode 624 the Daily's George Corp.

102
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,500
Could you be kick-pourced and loved as DJ Axel from his brand new mash-up album Break-in-the-Long?

103
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Well, of course, the official supplier of the mash-ups for the Charlie Mashup Town.com.

104
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Check out the show notes of DailySourceco.com for links.

105
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Everybody, how you doing?

106
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,500
It is, well, actually, the morning started off beautiful blue sky.

107
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I was like, oh, man, is this the day that I mean, it doesn't work out.

108
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,500
I can't fly up to nodding him today to go look at Christina's pink mini,

109
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
which is still waiting for me after my purchase on eBay.

110
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

111
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
I got to go to London town.

112
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
I got a couple meetings this afternoon.

113
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,500
So being picked up at one o'clock to go into the city.

114
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
So it's going to be pretty busy.

115
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Still enough time to seek out, you know, where we're rekindling podfinder.

116
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Of course, we have podfinder UK, which you can find at podfinderuk.com with the lovely,

117
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Luscious, Lissivius, Joe Lawrence.

118
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
That's the video version.

119
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
We're rekindling the US version.

120
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
You'll find that at podfinder.podge.com.

121
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I don't think it's all set up yet, but we're doing themes now of packaging the show into themes.

122
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
And it's really going to be good.

123
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,500
I'm producing it to actually, I'm just asshole talented this.

124
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Peedub and Brian Know, they're producing it.

125
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
It's going to be awesome.

126
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
So be able to look out for that.

127
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
So I did that this morning.

128
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
And of course, want to get a show in for you.

129
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Lots of responses having the lady Patricia on the program yesterday.

130
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,500
One in particular, I guess this is a Yanks versus the Brits thing.

131
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,500
We're just really not good at understanding the dialect yet, I guess.

132
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,500
We were convinced that the news reader on BBC radio 2 in the afternoon,

133
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
at least the one who's on the Steve Wright in the afternoon show.

134
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
We're convinced that her name was Vanilla Fudge.

135
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Close but no cigar.

136
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
I had a little bit of junk work from that Scott.

137
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
That's Mrs. Fudge to you.

138
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
And it's Vanilla, spell fox or echo in November.

139
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Echo Lima, Lima, Alpha.

140
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Of course, he recently married Mr. Fudge.

141
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
She was Vanilla having him.

142
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
And she's a good girl right now.

143
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
I love it.

144
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
That's almost as bad as David guest.

145
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
I don't know.

146
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
David guest used to be Liza Monelli's husband,

147
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,500
and he was on, I'm a celebrity get me out of here in the jungle.

148
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,500
On the UK version of, is there any other version of the show?

149
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I guess he had the UK version of the show.

150
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,500
And he had convinced all of his jungle mates that his maid's name was of a ginica.

151
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
And she married Mr. Seaman.

152
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
I know.

153
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
I know.

154
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Let me see.

155
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Lots of stuff to promote today.

156
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,500
First of all, today is the day the music died.

157
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Although I don't like that slogan.

158
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,500
But thousands of internet radio streams are going dark today.

159
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,500
In protest of the copyright royalty boards fee hike.

160
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
That will be, it is mandatory.

161
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Anyone who is creating an internet stream of licensed music,

162
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,500
even music that is not licensed or owned by the RIA, by the way.

163
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Will have to be paid for.

164
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,500
It's a statutory, so read mandatory license.

165
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,500
So basically, all these people who have been creating playlists of songs,

166
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
and have been streaming those.

167
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Essentially, to me is the same as sharing your playlist with friends over a stream.

168
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,500
So you're basically programming your friends playlist.

169
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,500
There are other people who are doing proper shows, not a lot.

170
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
I get the feeling.

171
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,500
And then, of course, there's a simultaneous streams.

172
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,500
All of those streams are most of them will go dark today in protests of these fee hikes.

173
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
They essentially have to pay per listen.

174
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,500
They're paying for the privilege of promoting music, which is so as backwards.

175
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
It's so wrong.

176
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Unless, of course, unless they are using music with a pre-existing arrangement,

177
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
which is exactly what the pod save music network is about.

178
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Now, okay, you may not find Beyonce on there,

179
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,500
but I'm pretty sure, you know, it doesn't matter.

180
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Now, if you are playing artists who are not on the pod save music network,

181
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
and you still want to stream and you don't want to pay for it,

182
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,500
then contact the artists and say, hey, put your stuff up on the pod save music network

183
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
and then I can play it.

184
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Royalty free.

185
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Mike says, Dear Mr. Curry, God, it makes me feel old.

186
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,500
I'm emailing you because you seem to be the go-to guy for pod casting in pod show.

187
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
I'm the process of setting up an internet radio station,

188
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
which I'm hoping to use to showcase pod save music and pod cast.

189
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Since most of the music I use would be from your, your pod save music network.

190
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Thank you.

191
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,500
It's, yeah, we operated, but I feel it's like everybody's.

192
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I thought it'd only be fair to email asking for your permission.

193
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Okay.

194
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Station will play three things primarily.

195
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Pod save music, pod cast promos, pod cast specials,

196
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
which would also be, I presume, music based specials.

197
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Awesome.

198
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Mike Kane, send me a link and I'll be happy to put that.

199
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,500
I'll be happy to plug that for you.

200
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,500
And of course, we'll be talking a bit later about the pod show channels,

201
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:43,500
which are in, in an effect creating a new opportunity for people who want to put together

202
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
good music for people to listen to in context.

203
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,500
And tomorrow, the final episode of port city PD of the first season,

204
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
the second seat.

205
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
I don't know how was that.

206
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Hold on a second.

207
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Let's just see what that is.

208
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Ah, no.

209
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,500
You've come through as identified, just as an unknown caller,

210
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,500
and you get pushed to voicemail.

211
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Season two of port city PD kicks off in July.

212
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,500
And we now have an all iPod only version feed.

213
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,500
So we've got the huge, I don't know if it's high death,

214
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
but it's certainly the huge version.

215
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,500
We've got the iPod version.

216
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,500
And you can now go and collect all of season one and get ready for season two.

217
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Now this is the second part of the, the two part season finale,

218
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:36,500
in which myself and pod show talent pimps and promotions pimps.

219
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Richard Brewer, hey, we both play law enforcement officers.

220
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,500
I'm an undercover asshole FBI agent and Richard is a not undercover asshole agent.

221
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Here.

222
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,500
So actually there's a video trailer.

223
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,500
What I'll do is I'll upload it and I'll put it as an embeddable on dailysourcecode.com

224
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
and encourage.com so you can take a look at it.

225
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Listen to the audio for a second.

226
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
It's kind of cool.

227
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
It looks really awesome.

228
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Ah, hold on.

229
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Here we go.

230
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
This is how it should work.

231
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Here we go.

232
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I need you to focus because time is short.

233
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
And I hate repeating myself.

234
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Kill them, Alex.

235
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Kill them all.

236
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:31,500
When he's dead.

237
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:44,220
You know, you really should be looking at this.

238
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,420
This is a whole bunch of scenes from, I don't know if it's from, I haven't seen these

239
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,420
before.

240
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,700
So I don't know if it's from the season finale episode or if it's from a new episode's

241
00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:00,040
coming, but it's, it's, it's violent, you can probably tell, but the girls in it are

242
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
sexy.

243
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,080
There's something really raw about these kids, they're North Carolina where they produce

244
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,120
this whole thing.

245
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,920
And there's a real raw energy in a lot of these performances that I'm totally digging.

246
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,640
Because the girls are beautiful, but they're not your typical like CSI beauties.

247
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,960
You know, these girls get, get roughed up, man.

248
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,800
I really do, why, that's disturbing that I find that hot.

249
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:52,560
Yeah, there's something else I'm seeing here, oh, Sheila, oh, that's hot.

250
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,920
These aren't Hollywood sets.

251
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,160
These are like real bars and real locations that they scout out in North Carolina.

252
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,320
Oh, that was nice.

253
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,680
That was nice, it's like, tell you what, though.

254
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,280
Well, you guys stand up there right next to us at the press conference when all this

255
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
is said.

256
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:17,080
Yeah, yeah, when my hair's like back, look at like a real douche, port city PD, season

257
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,800
two coming July, port city PD.puncho.com.

258
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,160
That's what we need.

259
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,600
We need Don La Fontaine to do the trailer.

260
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,160
This is how frickin' expensive, but man, does it pay off?

261
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
So that's cool.

262
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,760
Oh, there's the voice message we're ever called turning that bit.

263
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,240
Oh, yeah, speaking of calling, very interesting call came in from, I think, quasi-selebrity

264
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
in the UK.

265
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,560
Seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three.

266
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:05,560
So how much is there, there's an edge of, this is, this is, this is very from what

267
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:16,880
fits the phone in about your code covers, the last Thursday, I plan to listen to your

268
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:25,920
podcast and I written myself, so I'll miss the folks in the, I'll send it to

269
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
you.

270
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:37,460
I think I've heard this guy on the radio here in the UK and I don't, I'm not sure if

271
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,960
it's an actor or fees for real, but it's like this old dude and he shows, he's like

272
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,240
a media stalker kind of and he calls, I forget what show I heard him in, I think

273
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,200
at a morning radio show or something, I've heard him around and now he's found, he's

274
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,760
found us, my friend, could it be a new savant in the making?

275
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:12,600
There's a little thing, I wanted to draw the attention to, he's used the word fact, fucking

276
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:26,320
five or six times, he takes 10 footdics instead of one size and you know, he takes on anyone's

277
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,320
lips, these devil yours is not very nice to listen to, crappy, you said, tell us,

278
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:40,240
crappy, buy it, tell us, don't know what that is, but crappy was, whoops, whoops, you

279
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:48,200
said, so could go, said, whoops, screw, that one makes that screw, he said one, and

280
00:15:48,200 --> 00:16:01,600
because fucking boobs hit this and, and, and, man's of delights, which on the ship is

281
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:11,080
a reference to, I might do, and later is not, you know, you're better than that, I'm

282
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,480
listening to the, the, the podcast, you're better than that, anyway, it's better than what

283
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:24,400
I'm saying, good luck, we give him up the, the split, I'm telling off now to roam himself

284
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:32,080
a great thing to do these, from my knowledge.

285
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:39,080
Barry from Wattford, eh, I can already hear the Jeff Smith making up a jingle for you dude, Barry

286
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,360
from Wattford, indeed.

287
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,360
I've got five copies of Sim City for the first time, I've got five copies of Sim City,

288
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,360
I've got five copies of Sim City, I've got five copies of Sim City, I've got five copies

289
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,360
of Sim City, I've got five copies of Sim City, I've got five copies of Sim City, I've got

290
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:15,360
five copies of Sim City for the Nintendo DS, to give away now if you want to be one of the first

291
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,360
people to play in the UK, do a pop-along to the show and have a listen, gamesweasel.btpotjo.com,

292
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,360
just answer the simple question and you can be a winner.

293
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:32,360
This summer, when you buy Coke, you get a music, you can win an iPod or free songs or

294
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
nightchains.

295
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,360
You know, Adam, feed up here, I just got to tell you, actually I just got to tell Patricia,

296
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,360
how much I loved hearing Crimea River on the DSC.

297
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:51,360
They know when I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that was a complete pilot mistake, pilot error,

298
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:59,360
operator error, because whenever PDoB is on the show, we have to celebrate that fact.

299
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,360
We've got to do a proper, we've got to roll out the jiggle because every supply has a jiggle

300
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
to do it on the same thing.

301
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,360
We've got a bit of a satellite repairman coming after a year,

302
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,360
a satellite repairman, watching all of you.

303
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,360
He'll fit your misconceptions and answer questions too.

304
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:30,360
It's the music I grew up with.

305
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,360
That's the music my dad would be blasting every Sunday in our house.

306
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Patricia got me so worked up, I'm going to give it a go myself.

307
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:51,360
First I got to turn up the reverb and then I guess I just have to start the track.

308
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,360
Now you say you're lonely.

309
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,360
You cry the whole night through.

310
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,360
I'll go kiddo.

311
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,360
Cry me a river.

312
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Cry me a river.

313
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:41,360
I cry the river over you.

314
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:49,360
And now you say you're sorry.

315
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:59,360
For being so untrue, will you can cry me a river?

316
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Cry me a river.

317
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:12,360
I cry a river over you.

318
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:20,360
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head.

319
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:27,360
While you never shed a tear.

320
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Remember, I remember all that you said.

321
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,360
Told me love was too flaming.

322
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Told me you were through with me and that now you say you love me.

323
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,360
We'll just improve that you do.

324
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Come on and cry me a river.

325
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,360
You gotta cry me a river.

326
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:12,360
Because I cry the river for you.

327
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,360
I cry the river over you.

328
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:36,360
I cry the river over you.

329
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
P.W. Fettin' everybody.

330
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
I cry the river over you.

331
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,360
I got a couple of emails from people saying, yeah, thanks for turning me on to that singsong.com.

332
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
As I spend five hours over there.

333
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,360
I don't know how those guys do it with the rights.

334
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Of course, we'll be the death of them at the end of the day, which is unfortunate.

335
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,360
Because it's such a great idea.

336
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,360
It's basically American Idol or Pop Idol in a box, if you will.

337
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,360
You go there, you find a song, you sing along, it records it.

338
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,360
There's no actual downloads of the songs involved.

339
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,360
But of course, you can hear how easy it is to use it as a karaoke box.

340
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,360
The lady Patricia didn't pee dub.

341
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
So you can record your own songs.

342
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,360
If you know your way around your computer, you can probably get that done very easily.

343
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
But it's awesome.

344
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,360
It's a lot of fun because you can listen to other people's versions and you could vote on them.

345
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
And of course, the best version pops to the top.

346
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
And that's what everyone listens to.

347
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360
So there's all kinds of social rewards.

348
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,360
I'm sure they can have games and prizes and all kinds of cool stuff in there.

349
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,360
The problem is, is that once that gets really successful,

350
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,360
here comes the recording business and they'll say, well, that's great.

351
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,360
You know, your entire business rests on our commodity.

352
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,360
On our our stuff, our music.

353
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,360
So we'd like you to pay some more for the privilege, please.

354
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
That's what always happens.

355
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,360
I wanted to talk about, yeah, warning.

356
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
Those of you who don't give a harass ass about the channels.

357
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,360
I'm pretty excited about it, though.

358
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
I'm getting emails now.

359
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
Clyde Kell.

360
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,360
Thank you for your comments on 622 about the old-time radio group.

361
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Even though I'm no longer part of that group by my own show,

362
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,360
and entity mystery play, internet radio, M.P.I.R. old-time radio.

363
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
And he's created a collection, too.

364
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,360
He says, I've got a, I figured out, I can now publish the RSS feed of my channel,

365
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,360
collection on potcha.com.

366
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,360
That's right.

367
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
And he puts a link to it.

368
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
I'll put that in the show notes as well.

369
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,360
The link to, to his old-time radio channel.

370
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,360
And here's a little secret for those of you who are playing along.

371
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,360
If you look at that URL for, for the RSS feed,

372
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
you found that.

373
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Or if you use the one, you'll see that they're all identical.

374
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,360
For, for raw XML, it ends in dot XML.

375
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,360
If you want it to play in, in the real player,

376
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
change that to dot SMIL.

377
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,360
If you want it to play in, when am change it to dot M.P.

378
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
You, if you want it to play in media player,

379
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
change it to dot ASX.

380
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,360
iTunes is really the only one that's different.

381
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,360
You have to change the HTTP to ITPC.

382
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
This is all geeky stuff.

383
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,360
I realized, but you know, what's happening now is we're taking all these independent bits that

384
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
that we already have built and constructed within pod shell.

385
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
We're going to make them functional.

386
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,360
So that you will really have a programming experience,

387
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
and not just an individual show experience,

388
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
and this is something everyone can participate in,

389
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,360
and also helps you manage all of your media and manage where it goes,

390
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
and how it gets there, and you can stream it,

391
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,360
you can download it, you can put it on your iPod,

392
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,360
and you can play it on pod shell.com with the dashboard.

393
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,360
It's really, you know, when we get all this stuff to the front,

394
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
as I said, we built our site upside down,

395
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,360
when we invert it, it's going to be awesome.

396
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
You know, one of the byproducts of this,

397
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,360
having all the right features at the bottom of the stack,

398
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,360
instead of the top, makes it very hard to explain

399
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
what I'm doing and what we're going with these channels.

400
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
A lot of you are already catching on,

401
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,360
and if you trackcurry.com, you'll see that I'm publishing

402
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,360
links to click and play different channels all the time now.

403
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,360
But Matt, that's not grass.

404
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
He took some time,

405
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,360
and it takes you through the pod show channels

406
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,360
in the inverted pyramid version in a few simple steps.

407
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Have you heard the news?

408
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
Pod show has added some amazing features

409
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
to their redesign website.

410
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Your experience podcasts are getting a whole new way.

411
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,360
How can I learn about the new pod show you might ask?

412
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Well, front no more.

413
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Navigating the new pod show is easy

414
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
with just a few simple instructions.

415
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
But rather than me, drone on about it,

416
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
let's hear from the pod father himself

417
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
to explain to you in just a few easy steps.

418
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,360
Well, I know your anxious to get started,

419
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
so let's jump right in.

420
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
Step one.

421
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
If you register for pod show,

422
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
you automatically have a channel.

423
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
Step two.

424
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
I'm going to search for any term.

425
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Step three.

426
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,360
Find a show.

427
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Click on the show.

428
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
It'll take you to the unofficial show guide page.

429
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
Step four.

430
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
Find an episode.

431
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,360
So not the show.

432
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
Just find an episode and click on get it

433
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
and then put it into your channel.

434
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Step five.

435
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Now then go to something called my collection.

436
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Step six.

437
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
What you see on the side is fucked up and wrong.

438
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Okay.

439
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
Step seven.

440
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Go to your collection and you'll see your channel there.

441
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,360
Step eight.

442
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
And click on it because you want to modify something.

443
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Step nine.

444
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,360
You can have it play in the dashboard or iTunes or

445
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,360
it has different players or even the raw XML.

446
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,360
Just select iTunes.

447
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Step ten.

448
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,360
Save it.

449
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,360
Step eleven.

450
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
Go to the play button on that channel.

451
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,360
Step twelve.

452
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
Don't click it.

453
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
But right click it.

454
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Okay.

455
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Step thirteen.

456
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
And copy that link.

457
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Step fourteen.

458
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,360
Send that link to anybody in email.

459
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Step fifteen.

460
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
The click on it.

461
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
In iTunes will open up.

462
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
Step six.

463
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,360
And then whatever you have collected in that channel.

464
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
Shows or episodes.

465
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,360
We'll go to their iPod.

466
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,360
Fantastic.

467
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,360
Step seventeen.

468
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Now here's the advanced fun for people who have been doing this a day or two.

469
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
And God, it's so hard to explain it.

470
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
Well, we need you to explain it.

471
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
You can't really explain it.

472
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,360
Well, I hope you can.

473
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Take the link of your channel.

474
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
Or that just explained how you do that.

475
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,360
You want to get the raw XML link.

476
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
Step like nineteen.

477
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,360
And import that as a show.

478
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
Step twenty.

479
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
You just say add show.

480
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,360
Step twenty one.

481
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,360
You can do it in the same channel even if you want.

482
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Which makes it a real mind trip.

483
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
Step twenty two.

484
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Once it's imported, you'll see the show is right there.

485
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,360
The same icon will be there that you put in the original channel.

486
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Click on it.

487
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,360
Step twenty three.

488
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
You'll now have your channel.

489
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,360
We'll now have an unofficial guide page that people can comment on.

490
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,360
Excellent.

491
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Step twenty four.

492
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,360
That of course is not the way that this is supposed to work.

493
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,360
But that is going to be the type of functionality where people can comment on your channel.

494
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
Okay.

495
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
And your channel actually becomes like a show.

496
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Awesome.

497
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
I love this.

498
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,360
Me too.

499
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
I'm not doing a great job really.

500
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
I'm explaining it yet.

501
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,360
Just have to kind of do it.

502
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,360
You said it.

503
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,360
So if you'd like to try out the new pod show, go to podshow.com.

504
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:14,360
Or if you think this is far too many steps, go to the subtlest zone at subtlest.podshow.com.

505
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,360
There is no step twenty eight.

506
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
See?

507
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
It's simple.

508
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
Go to Adam.podshow.com.

509
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Scroll down to my channels.

510
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,360
The pod save internet radio channel is the the one that's the default.

511
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
You can set all of that and just hit play channel.

512
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,360
It'll open up the real player and you can listen to some great pod save music.

513
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,360
Some great pod save music shows.

514
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,360
Scroll down.

515
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
Look at more channels.

516
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,360
Click play channel.

517
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,360
It's really not all that.

518
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,360
It's really not twenty seven steps.

519
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
But what I have asked Andrew Grumman.

520
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
I've asked Andrew and Devon.

521
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,360
To clone on the development environment.

522
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,360
I want them to clone the the channel page.

523
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,360
And I want them to put that at a special URL.

524
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,360
So I can expose that.

525
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,360
Because I want you to see how cool it's going to be when you can actually manage the output of a channel.

526
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
And I've requested something else.

527
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Sorry about that.

528
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
You're rich.

529
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
Well, forget.

530
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
I'm not going to tell you whatever.

531
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,360
It's it's really coming together.

532
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:23,360
And it's going to be a great way to discover new shows because just like pod save music where you want to find out what shows have played a particular song.

533
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,360
You'll you'll see an episode or you'll see an episode from a show or a single episode.

534
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,360
And you'll be able to see who has that listed in their channels.

535
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,360
And then you'll be able to look at their channel.

536
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,360
It's almost like the old Napster.

537
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,360
Where if you found a song you'd really like, you could look at that person's hard drive and see all the other songs they like.

538
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
So it's kind of like, you know, looking at people's stuff.

539
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:52,360
It's a little voyeuristic, but and which reminds me I may want to have some kind of private feature to put some of the shows.

540
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,360
Having my collection.

541
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,360
I'd like to switch the private bid on please.

542
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,360
I know I know I'm actually watching or listening to some of those shows.

543
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
Hey Adam, it's John Gworkin.

544
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,360
Ask out.

545
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
Hey John.

546
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,360
I think last week has to be the week it all happened all together.

547
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
If it didn't work just planned.

548
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,360
I used my pod show channel to get the SEC61.

549
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,360
The video podcast.

550
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,360
I used my Nokia E61I and the Nokia pod catching clients to download it from my pod show channel.

551
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,360
And of course I watched the video that you took from your aircraft on the E61I.

552
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,360
On my E61I.

553
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
I think that's a full house.

554
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
It is a full house.

555
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
Very cool.

556
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
All right.

557
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,360
So that's cool.

558
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,360
Yeah, then the Nokia's the E series certainly.

559
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360
And I believe the, yeah, the N series as well.

560
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,360
They have a pod casting application.

561
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
So I think it comes pre bundled on most of them.

562
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,360
But you might have to go and download it from Nokia.com slash pod casting.

563
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,360
I think it's slash pod casting.

564
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,360
And you can subscribe to your channels.

565
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,360
It's a real pain in the ass to subscribe to something in this.

566
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,360
So it's much easier if you just put your shows into a channel.

567
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,360
The ones that you want on your Nokia.

568
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,360
And you can manage them from a web browser.

569
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,360
It's a lot easier that way.

570
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,360
It would be fun.

571
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,360
You know, it's Nokia.

572
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,360
We're thinking kind of like Apple, you know, Apple made that one click URL by,

573
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,360
by changing the HTTP to ITPC.

574
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Why does a Nokia do like, you know,

575
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,360
INPC or something like that?

576
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
So that it'll, it could, you know,

577
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,360
if you find a link and RSS feed the you want on your Nokia.

578
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,360
You just click on it from the internal web browser.

579
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
Man, it's just a thought.

580
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Adam, what's going on man?

581
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
There's damn matters.

582
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
And from the creepy show.

583
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,360
Hey, I'm in the process of moving from the black hill of South Dakota near the city.

584
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,360
But just want to comment on pod show and the channel feature,

585
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,360
which actually find to be one of the more unique aspects of the site.

586
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,360
Uh, it's people are an example of how it works.

587
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,360
I set up a site at choose or snooze.creepysleepy.com.

588
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,360
And that's uh, left, right, and center political coverage from now until the election.

589
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Uh, and I made a channel.

590
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,360
Uh, it could be sleepy, essential politics channel to stay up on what's going on in the political world and the campaign and the election.

591
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,360
And I just, uh, imported that into WordPress in an RSS reader and then it just displays for people.

592
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
And again, you don't have to get geeky.

593
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
You can just check it out and see how it works.

594
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,360
It just brings in the latest sources, the newest sources of podcasts that contain the politics and the likes.

595
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
And make it really simple for everybody.

596
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,360
So, uh, check it out.

597
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,360
Maybe seeing it will help your listeners figure it out.

598
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
Cool, man.

599
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Yeah, I posted a link to that on curry.com yesterday.

600
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,360
I'll put it in today's show notes.

601
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,360
Uh, very cool.

602
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:48,360
So, um, you can actually, you know, so what Dan is not doing is he is managing a channel of political shows.

603
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,360
And, uh, he doesn't have a lot of control over it right now, but pretty soon he'll be able to, uh,

604
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,360
really put in individual episodes and put them in an order that makes sense.

605
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:05,360
You know, he may choose to do a, uh, a viewpoint or show that has a democratic nominee guessed on one and have that followed by Republicans.

606
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,360
So it could give almost like an sort of kind of an equal airtime in that channel.

607
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,360
Um, and you can just play it on his channel, uh, page.

608
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
Or, uh, it's interesting what he did on it.

609
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:23,360
He, uh, he imported the channel's feed into his WordPress blog, which I was pretty interesting, uh, which is, of course, completely valid.

610
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,360
This is, the mind boggles, we need, we just really need examples.

611
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,360
So, uh, yeah, Dan, thank you very much. That's cool, dude.

612
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,360
All right, to wrap it up for today, he had him pee Hopkins here. What's up?

613
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,360
Uh, it's been a while since I talked to you.

614
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,360
I don't know if you have any plans to spin my tune become either today or tomorrow,

615
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,360
because if you per chance do, could you please also mention that I'm playing a specific, uh,

616
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,360
a special acoustic show at the Viper room in Los Angeles on Tuesday, June 26.

617
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,360
That's 10 p.m. in Hollywood.

618
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
I appreciate the support. Are you kidding me, man?

619
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Pete?

620
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,360
Any excuse to play your song.

621
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,360
Check him out tonight at the Viper room.

622
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,360
It's Pete Hopkins. Here's the come.

623
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,360
My life sentence already is the way I feel.

624
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,360
It's just the way I feel.

625
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,360
But I wouldn't have it any other way.

626
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,360
Life has a funny way.

627
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,360
I think it's what they say.

628
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Yes, what they say.

629
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,360
Uh, surprising you, reaching every day.

630
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,360
So let me sing this song.

631
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,360
And it won't take long.

632
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,360
For the melody, to wash over you.

633
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,360
And meet them, we can sing this song.

634
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,360
As a day is long.

635
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:43,360
And let the melody set you free.

636
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,360
And it goes along and along, along, along, along, along.

637
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:53,360
There's a little more to learn from every one.

638
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,360
La, la, la, la, la, la.

639
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:05,360
No one has had the answer of their own.

640
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Just be loved and become.

641
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,360
Boom, yeah.

642
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,360
So many things to do.

643
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,360
It's the time and nothing ever time and no.

644
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,360
And meet another year, just to get it done.

645
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,360
It's hard to overcome.

646
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,360
I feel like dreams, yet live on dreams.

647
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,360
But I've been human still, we must become.

648
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,360
So let me sing this song.

649
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,360
And it won't take long.

650
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,360
For the melody, to wash over you.

651
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,360
And meet them, we can sing this song.

652
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,360
As a day is long.

653
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:00,360
And let the melody set you free.

654
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,360
And it goes along and along, along, along, along.

655
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:09,360
There's a little more to learn from every one.

656
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,360
La, la, la, la, la, la.

657
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:22,360
No one has had the answers of their own.

658
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:28,360
To be loved is to be stronger.

659
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,360
You can live on with the pain.

660
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,360
Like I've listened to the fond memories.

661
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,360
Sounds like a lullaby.

662
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,360
Believe it or just leave it.

663
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,360
But you don't know until you feel it.

664
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:55,360
Ooh, yeah.

665
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,360
And then we can sing this song.

666
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,360
And it won't feel wrong.

667
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:07,360
To let the melody wash over you.

668
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Ooh, yeah.

669
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
La, la, la, la, la, la.

670
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,360
There's a little more to learn from every one.

671
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:43,360
La, la, la, la, la, la.

672
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:49,360
No one has had the answers of their own.

673
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,360
La, la, la, la, la, la.

674
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,360
