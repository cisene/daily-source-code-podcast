Got something to say?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Walk it with your fruit-whip log from GoDaddy.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm casting it out of curry.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't have to tell you things about. Everybody knows things about.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The dollar buys the nickel's worth.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Banks are going busch up, keep us keep a dozen under the counter.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Pumps are running wild in the street.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There's nobody anywhere it seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We sick watching our TV's while some local newscaster tells us

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We know things are bad and worse than bad.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So we don't go out anymore.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And all we say is please at least believe it's alone in our living rooms.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let me have my toast or my TV and my steel melted radios.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I won't say anything just leave us alone.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, I'm not new to leave you alone.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I want you to get mad.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to ride.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't want you to ride to your congressmen because I wouldn't know what to tell you to ride.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime and the speak.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, I know he's at first. You've got to get mad.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You've got to say, I'm a human being.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
God, direct, my life has made you.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I want you to get out now.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I want all of you to get out bottom of your chest.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So I want you to get out bright now.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And go to the window.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I will connect.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We stick your head out as you know.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm just proud as hell,

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and I'm not starting to take this anymore.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I want you to get out bright now.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
To the windows of the members.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Stick your head out and yell.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm just proud as hell.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But I must be an architect.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There's any more things about it.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm a musician since it's been 40 years.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Since you're so.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I know this is a really good one.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You don't get the courage and you can't get into their diggers anymore.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
They will figure out what they do about the depression

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and beliefs.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Use your power and death as a nerd.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Sh Fish andfish Snos!

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Scratch!

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Get it with your eyes!

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Bastard!

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There's a scruncher!

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't rise, hide your face!

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Stop!

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All my lives and all!

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm never still heading x4!

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm not going to take it anymore!

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,740
What is that getting more?!

65
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,960
That can't be

66
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,280
Look there

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,760
I am most definitely on the list

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,760
I'm not going to hear what it is, but it's not a pretty one because I am going to get ripped apart every single time I come into the States.

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:59,760
And I'm just not going to buckle, you know, I'm going to get these guys shit when they are telling me that I can't enter the United States without a business guard.

70
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
That's a pretty shit, pretty shit.

71
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,760
Tell the sheriff Charlie, 681.

72
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
Full bar.

73
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:24,760
God save me, ancient man, from the field, from the great thing that I see.

74
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:35,760
I look stars up, with my crossbow, I shot, I held a shot.

75
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,760
The world is my oyster.

76
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Oh yeah, the fight is a full war Friday from no town, we will be asleep.

77
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Get ready for the ride.

78
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,760
I am coming, set to the end.

79
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:05,760
I feel a little cold.

80
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:14,760
If I confess or see nothing else, I'll still sleep before the night tonight.

81
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,260
I'm looking to play time to fight this fight

82
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,260
You're like family, tell me tell me tell me

83
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,760
The Americans, the son of God, are you?

84
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,260
He's still a spy, I'll get to what he's done

85
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,260
I'm gonna play the fight, he's still a spy

86
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
I'm looking to play the fight

87
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:47,260
I'm trying to crush it, I'll never let it cross the scene

88
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,260
Sing, I'll never let it cross the scene

89
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,260
Don't you let it walk, don't you let it be like this

90
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,260
Don't you let it walk, don't you let it go

91
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,260
Don't you let it walk, don't you let it walk

92
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,260
The sentence to it, the lines of the sentence

93
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,260
When the world is gone, I'm not my choice

94
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,260
The sentence to it, the judge's me

95
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,260
Don't you let it cross the scene

96
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,260
Sing, I'll never let it cross the scene

97
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,260
Don't you let it cross the scene

98
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,260
Don't you let it walk, don't you let it walk

99
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,260
Sing, I'll never let it cross the scene

100
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,260
Don't you let it cross the scene

101
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,260
The sentence to it, the lines of the sentence

102
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,260
When the world is gone, I'm not my choice

103
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,260
The sentence to it, the lines of the sentence

104
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,260
When the world is gone, I'm not my choice

105
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,260
According to the context of the sentence to this sentence

106
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,260
The sentence to it, the sentence to it

107
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:14,140
All right,��!

108
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,860
Pop the Zimmer.

109
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:21,380
This is my one step.

110
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,320
That'll be his moon.

111
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,460
It'll be his white one, stay.

112
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:25,460
10s, 7 ways to win, 7 down with slopes, 7 muddy poles, 7 higher burning fires.

113
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:47,460
7 your desire, 1, 1, 7 holy paths to hell.

114
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,460
All in a hot, cold, copper sky, a bloody sun at the moon.

115
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,460
Right up above the mast, it stands no bigger than the moon.

116
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:09,460
Day after day, day after day we stop, we're breath through motion.

117
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,460
As either as a painter, ship up on a painted ocean.

118
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,460
Water, water everywhere, all you want is to shrink.

119
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:25,460
Water, water everywhere, make any drop to clear.

120
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:53,460
Water, water everywhere, all you want is to shrink.

121
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,460
Water, water everywhere, make any drop to clear.

122
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,460
Water, water everywhere, make any drop to clear.

123
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,460
Water, water everywhere, all you want is to shrink.

124
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:15,460
Water, water everywhere, all you want is to shrink.

125
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:23,460
Water, water everywhere, make any drop to clear.

126
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:29,460
Water, water everywhere, all you want is to shrink.

127
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:36,460
Water, water everywhere, make any drop to clear.

128
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:56,060
Oh, this is going to be one for the archives.

129
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:11,060
I'm not quite sure what it is.

130
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,060
I got a lot of emotions to get out.

131
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,060
I'm going to do it with the music today.

132
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,060
And a daily source code from our Friday edition.

133
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:34,060
The wax audio made and goes Hollywood, and a little made with a little Frankie.

134
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,060
Damn.

135
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,060
I'm not quite sure what it was, but somewhere in the chain something was overmodulating.

136
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,060
And I'm not quite sure what it was, but it's not pretty footballer to me.

137
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:56,060
This is daily source code, 681 Adam Curry coming to you from the Curry Condo in Northern California, San Francisco.

138
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,060
Can you tell what I've been doing some work for you?

139
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,060
Surfing around for some mashups.

140
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:10,060
Special thanks to Scott Sloan from the AlaskaPod Show.com for the opening montage Mattis Hell from Network 77.

141
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:40,060
I'm not quite sure what it was, but I'm not quite sure what it was, but I'm not quite sure what it was, but I'm not quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite

142
00:12:40,060 --> 00:13:10,060
sure what it was, but I'm quite sure that it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I turned it on, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure I was, but I'm quite sure what it was, it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, and I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I was quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but I'm quite sure what it was, but

143
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,060
Thank you!

144
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,060
Oh my god!

145
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,060
Crap, we got the cowbell!

146
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,060
Do your brain!

147
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,060
Never thought before!

148
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,060
No, no, no!

149
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,060
To your cave it changed my life!

150
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

151
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,060
What was cloudy now is clear, yeah, yeah!

152
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,060
You're alive and I need it, yeah!

153
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,060
You got what I want, I'm all in!

154
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,060
So keep on giving it up!

155
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,060
So tell your mother!

156
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,060
No, no, no, no!

157
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,060
No, no, no, no!

158
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,060
No, no, no, no, no!

159
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,060
I'll be present to you!

160
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,060
For once I won't ever want to know that you won't die in love with me!

161
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,060

235
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,980
weirder about it is that when you asked Dr. Ron whether or not he was a folder or a scruncher

236
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,180
he kind of sounded like you know who were you you were some kind of freak or something well Ron

00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:14,780
oh no

330
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:25,980
I remember I remember I don't worry I'll put on the ever forget it's the first time

331
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,420
the last time we ever met

332
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:39,580
but I know the reason why you keep your silence up

333
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:48,060
look until soon it's heard doesn't show the place to go

334
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:59,500
it's urgent to kill me I can feel it calm it in the air and I

335
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,580
oh no

336
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:09,580
and I've been waiting for this moment for all my life

337
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,580
oh no

338
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:22,540
I can feel it in the air and I can have you waiting for

339
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:28,860
and I've been waiting for this moment for all my life

340
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,620
oh no

341
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:42,140
I can feel it calm it in the air and I can have you waiting for all my life

342
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:51,740
and I've been waiting for this moment for all my life

343
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:19,180
they come from Ford Lauderdale they call themselves non-points

344
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,060
thanks to Marcus Coward for contributing to today's footballer Friday

345
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:27,980
what a awesome awesome cover version of classic Genesis in the air tonight

346
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,820
I think that am I space page in the show notes and daily source code.com

347
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:36,060
of course not hot safe so

348
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,700
and you get twice the drum fill in the original

349
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,460
don't get much better than that doesn't

350
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,340
wrapping up the first week of San Francisco Northern California

351
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,100
at the Curri condo for the footballer Friday

352
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,180
so far down

353
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,180
David Usher

354
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:11,180
take the chemicals that help you through the day

355
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,660
step outside your door

356
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,220
to be all of the same

357
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:21,180
no one says a word

358
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:26,300
we all get both of the earth

359
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,940
and it seems to fall down and it's so far

360
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:36,220
we're sitting together we are born

361
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:43,580
and it seems so far down and it's so far

362
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,540
it's so far

363
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,580
it's so far

364
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
it's so far

365
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,580
it's so far

366
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:03,580
it's so far

367
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:08,700
we all get both of the earth

368
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:13,420
and it seems so far down and it's so far

369
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:18,700
we're sitting together we are born

370
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:24,380
and it seems so far down and it's so far

371
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:34,380
it's so far

372
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,380
it's so far

373
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,380
it's so far

374
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,380
it's so far

375
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,380
it's so far

376
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,380
it's so far

377
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,380
it's so far

378
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,380
it's so far

379
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,380
it's so far

380
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,380
it's so far

381
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,380
it's so far

382
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,380
we all get both of the earth

383
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:26,380
and it seems so far down and it's so far

384
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,380
it's so far

385
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,380
it's so far

386
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,380
it's so far

387
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:48,380
it's so far

388
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:52,380
it's like I'm having my private party here in the condo

389
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,380
just jamming away for an hour, playing some tunes with a couple of friends

390
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,380
I really do appreciate you being along for the ride this week

391
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,380
it's been quite a long and intense one

392
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,380
but it's great having you here

393
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,380
it's Friday

394
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,380
but they Tuesday Wednesday Thursday

395
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,380
through about Friday

396
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,380
Adam's final fun on the Wii

397
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,380
gee, I wonder what it could be

398
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,380
do you think it could be Ron Paul related for November 5th?

399
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,380
I think so

400
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,380
I'm even slurring my word that's how tired I am

401
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,380
yes please

402
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:26,380
if you're intended to support Ron Paul for President

403
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,380
and maybe from what you've learned on this show

404
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,380
you just might have decided to

405
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,380
several people send me email to that effect

406
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,380
that's pretty cool obviously

407
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,380
you know we got a way to go before the actual election

408
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,380
but first there's all these chess pieces on the board

409
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,380
that's the way the system works

410
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,380
so one of the chess pieces we've got to move

411
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,380
is getting Ron Paul on the Republican ticket

412
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,380
as the Republican nominee so that's the first piece

413
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,380
how do you do that?

414
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,380
well you need to advertise at the right time

415
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,380
because you know that tell Americans

416
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,380
choose their presidents

417
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,380
based upon the commercials

418
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,380
so lots of money is needed for that

419
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,380
and currently number three in the entire race

420
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,380
is Ron Paul

421
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,380
and I think it's like 80 or 90 percent

422
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,380
of that has come from the internet

423
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,380
so of course I'll be a link in the show notes

424
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,380
if they have the source code dot com

425
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,380
click on that and the code is put in

426
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,380
so I can track that and let you know how many people

427
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,380
donated through this program

428
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,380
and there's lots of places around the internet

429
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,380
where you can get to that obviously

430
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,380
Ron Paul 2008 dot com is another place

431
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,380
can you tell I'm fried?

432
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,380
all right I want to play one more song

433
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,380
it's from the first gen iPod

434
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,380
which of course is stored here at the condo

435
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,380
you're going to love it

436
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,380
okay this is my dream right?

437
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,380
I've got myself a big ass hog

438
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,380
I'm talking like you know

439
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,380
maybe it's a soft tail maybe it's a fat boy right?

440
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,380
I got the speakers loaded right there

441
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,380
I'm losing down the street

442
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,380
and it's nice sunshine

443
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,380
and I've got this song on real love

444
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,380
the last one with all the dynamics

445
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,380
that you don't have an MP3

446
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,380
that's 10

447
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,380
classic zombies

448
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,380
you know it doesn't like Carlos

449
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,380
she's not there

450
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,380
no one know me about her

451
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,380
no man she lied

452
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,380
no one know me about her

453
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,380
how many people cry

454
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,380
and it's great to show you

455
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,380

456
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,380
