1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
Well, hi everybody, welcome to daily source code episode number 522, still coming to you

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,200
from the box laden curry cottage, soon to be the formerly the former kind, I got to come

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,200
up with that sentence, soon to be our ex-coated, let's put it that way, it's Sunday

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
afternoon.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,480
And oh, by the way, I'm calling this episode 522, I realized I made kind of a rookie mistake.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,920
And you changed the nomenclature of your podcast.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,000
So I, instead of doing the episode number and DSE in the date sequence, I was putting

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,760
a BOC in the BOC number in there, that really messes up a lot of different players, who

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,080
do list shows and alphabetical order.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,400
And so I'm just going to turn it back to the episode numbering that I've been using.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,800
Also, since I am putting original content, even in the best of Charlie's, I guess they

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,160
kind of qualify as a regular daily source code.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,440
So part of the advantage of moving house, and as you know, we're in the middle of that,

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,440
we have the new house, we're slowly building stuff up.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,280
You, of course, you start with the curtains, I've learned that over the years, after painting

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,480
the kitchen, you know, then you kind of start to move over the glassware and you want

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,000
to do most of that stuff yourself.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,200
And then by Wednesday, the movers are coming and all the heavy lifting is going to be

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,800
done, but they're still going to keep the podcast console here until Thursday.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,000
And when they bring that over, then of course, will officially have been moved into the

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,480
new dwelling, the new cottage.

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,400
So as I go through draws and draws of stuff, which, of course, is stuff, if it's your

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,120
stuff, it's shit.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,280
My shit is my stuff.

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,160
Now, looking at gadgets and basically making evaluations, whether I should throw something

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,200
out, put together big box of stuff to sell on eBay, or, of course, save it.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,480
And a lot of the stuff, as you can imagine, still winds up in the to be saved pile.

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:05,440
So to my power book, G4, which you know, I, excuse me, I switched over to Windows platform

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,400
after my third power book in as many years, bit the dust, and it had to be sent off

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
to Apple.

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,160
Several months for it to be returned, probably almost three months, and it came back

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,880
and the battery was to hose, so I had never really got back to using it, but I, I cracked

33
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,000
it open today in my evaluation process and realized that in garage band was the, about

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
8% complete edit of a podcast I did in interview with Ray Lane and John Doer and Bill

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Joy from cleaner Perkins, the world renowned investment firm, Bill Joy, of course, known

36
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:47,200
for founding, a co-founding son Microsystems, Ray Lane known for a number of backgrounds,

37
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,840
including, of course, the, being president of Oracle Corporation and John Doer, one of the

38
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,000
most famous venture capitalists in the business.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,640
And at the time, and I'm not quite sure of the date, because the date stamps are all over

40
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
the place in Garage Band.

41
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,200
I can't really figure out when it was recorded.

42
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,640
It was done via Skype and, and a phone bridge, it was in the summer, because I do

43
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,320
remember recording it and being very hot and actually during the interview, I was taking

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,640
off my shirts down there in my wife, Peter, while the conversation was going on, but it

45
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:26,920
was timed with the release of an announcement by Cliner Perkins that they had made a fund,

46
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,120
which was available for $100 million.

47
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,560
By now, I believe that has been doubled to $200 million, called the green tech fund.

48
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,080
And that means that this money is going to be invested in, quote, green technologies.

49
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,600
Now, of course, I was, at the time, I was very into Trinity, biodiesel, and I wanted to

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,600
know a lot more about what these guys who, without a doubt, are gentlemen who can make

51
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,640
the earth move and have done so in the past, their big players, in big money and make

52
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,520
a lot of things happen.

53
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,600
How they were going to approach, filling out this, spending this money essentially,

54
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,440
what they were going to spend it on and what they see as the trends and clearly global warming

55
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:15,240
and the price of oil and or even the availability of oil are making these initiatives

56
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,840
very, very important.

57
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:24,040
Now, what you'll learn, as you listen to this interview, which, by the way, I was not paid to

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,480
do, it was at my request, it will sound a bit like a commercial for Cliner Perkins,

59
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,800
but not in the way you might expect, if you listen all the way to the end, it's just shy

60
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,360
of 29 minutes, but it really gives an interesting insight into how Cliner Perkins, at least,

61
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,440
is venture capital firm operates and what they're looking in and even how you can approach them.

62
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,440
Of course, I have to disclose that Cliner Perkins is an investor in Pod Show, but as you

63
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,200
listen to it, I think it'll become clear that there's no real benefit to me doing this other than

64
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,680
keeping the relationship going with these guys, which I value immensely, but listen to how they

65
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,840
approach problems, how they approach companies ideas, and how they approach the world, I think

66
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,840
you, I think you'll get a kick out of it. So, oh yeah, I even did the whole corporate intro thing

67
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,000
just to make it sound really cool, like big brewing voice here, ladies and gentlemen,

68
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,720
Ray Lane, John Dore, Bill Joy of Cliner Perkins about the Green Tech Fund on the Charney.

69
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,200
Maybe, I don't know who wants to, you know, who wants to kind of get it going, but

70
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,640
the most logical place to start, I feel, is with the announcement of the the most recent fund,

71
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,920
which is fund number 12, I believe, and then we can, I don't know, John, or Ray, if you want to

72
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,120
pick that up and just explain exactly, you know, what this 100 million Green Tech initiative is,

73
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,720
and then we can kind of take it from there.

74
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:07,080
Glad you asked, Cliner Perkins, Prof. Bill Dan Buyers, is in the relationship and venture

75
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,360
capital business, which means we're helping entrepreneurs, innovators, scientists, doctors,

76
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,640
those who want to do more than anyone, things possible with less than anything,

77
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,040
less than anyone, things possible, literally to go out and change the world to

78
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:33,240
realize of dreams and their ambitions. And we've been doing this now since 1972, and so the latest

79
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,600
of our funds, our venture capital funds, Cliner Perkins, Coffield and Buyers number 12,

80
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:46,600
really the first in which we have earmarked money for a very important and exciting area, namely

81
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:55,400
that of what we call green technologies, ways to address some of the largest needs and economic

82
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:03,080
opportunity on the planet. It seems like the venture capital business is, if anything really a business

83
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,160
of timing and understanding of timing. So when I read an announcement like this and certainly a

84
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,560
dollar figure of $100 million, which 100 million of anything is quite impressive,

85
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:21,560
is it now time has the, have alternative fuels and biotechnology's finally reached the tipping

86
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,360
point where this is really a forge ahead, a leapfrog, if you will?

87
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:34,920
Well, it's quite clear there's a market need in $60 a barrel oil, it speaks of large and expensive

88
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:42,920
volumes, but there's also important technological advances and I think Ray Lane, my partners on

89
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,200
this conversation with us, as is Bill Joy, and I think Bill would be particularly good at speaking

90
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,800
to those. Before Bill does that, sorry, Bill, let me just kind of add to what John said about

91
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:01,240
it before we go into the technology. You know, the venture business is one where its success is

92
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:10,600
driven by seeing trends, seeing paths before other see them because of technological developments.

93
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:19,640
And so this focus on green tech is similar to other trends we've seen in the past,

94
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,520
such as the internet or the semiconductor industry or the enterprise software industry and

95
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,040
the development of various trends within it. And this is a major initiative as most of our funds have

96
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:35,960
been have been focused on major initiatives that we develop a perspective around

97
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,840
developed deep expertise on so that we can make smart investments in. And we think the timing is such

98
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:49,560
that the technology is at a point, you know, most technological developments over the last several

99
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:56,760
hundred years have gone through a predictable shape or curve where early adopters, you know,

100
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:03,480
we can actually see where the cost per unit of output, no matter what it is, whether it is

101
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:13,160
more law in the computer business or its metcast law or other laws in the networking business,

102
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:20,440
but various or go back a hundred years and and look at the amount of output and factories

103
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,760
and different core methodologies. But when we can see the shape of that curve before it has been

104
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,560
adopted and we can see the productivity will be an order of magnitude better than its predecessor

105
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,800
technology. And we think that is the right time to focus on it. And we can certainly see that

106
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,720
in the green tech initiative now. Bill, do you want to add to that?

107
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:52,600
Basically green tech involves consumption and production of resources and whether electricity or

108
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:01,240
or water or food and this largely involves chemistry, I mean electric chemistry and batteries,

109
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:08,520
this chemical reaction or making making clean water from dirty water is to separate molecules.

110
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:15,160
And what's happened is that advanced technology has reached the point now where we can begin to

111
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,200
change and design things at the scales to do better than we could with the kind of crude chemistry

112
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,760
we did in the past. So we can genetically engineer organisms to clean things up or we can

113
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:33,000
engineer new materials to make resource-oriented processes more efficient. So we suddenly have the

114
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,440
opportunity to make the kind of large factor improvements that will make a real change in the world.

115
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,440
And these industries that have been frozen out of very slow rate of advance are to no rate of

116
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:52,520
advance for a very long time. The announcement of the investments you want to make came

117
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:00,760
very close to the to the state of the union with President Bush. I presume it started to hit

118
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:09,640
hard on his own legacy but really laid in about the U.S.'s addiction to oils, particularly foreign oil.

119
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,040
Is that something that you knew was coming? Is that purely coincidence? Is it all just things

120
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:22,680
coming together at the right time? Is it for real? Is the government on the same pages as you are?

121
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,360
Well, I think the amount of money that the government is investing in the series

122
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,880
is not up to the challenge and hope that it increases. We certainly come at this from

123
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:40,040
separate paths but whether you're looking at this glasses half empty or half full, I think you

124
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:47,240
have to say that until this point in time we've been as a country and as a state as a world in

125
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:55,640
trouble with respect to energy innovation. And as we look around whether it's with the initiatives

126
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:02,520
that Governor Schwarzenegger has launched in California or President Bush for the United States,

127
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:11,240
being green, embracing green, sustainable technologies is without a doubt the most tough-minded

128
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:18,680
and geostrategic and pro-growth and Tom Friedman would say even patriotic thing that can be done.

129
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,120
It used to be that being green were the things Sissis would do the sort of hugging

130
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,800
liberals, but the government, the frog would disagree with that. And Tom Friedman would disagree,

131
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:39,240
but all of a sudden to find a way to win the world from $60 a barrel oil that's going to

132
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:48,600
fuel radical Islamic regimes in the Middle East and is more than a matter of smart economic

133
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:59,880
it's a matter of worldwide stability and sustainability. All the experts now agree that

134
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:07,720
there is a serious climate crisis underway in the form of global warming. And so we need real

135
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,840
innovation and incentives for innovations in renewable energy, wind, solar, biofuels,

136
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:24,280
clean water, clean transportation, increased conservation. And we've seen European nations because

137
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,640
of their higher energy prices take the lead in this regard, but the largest consumer both in

138
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,880
an absolute sense in per capita is the United States of America here in North America. And historically

139
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,480
America has been one of the world's great innovators. So I think the way to look at this green

140
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,760
glass half full is that it's a great area for entrepreneurs and innovators to go make a difference.

141
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,760
And I think the big difference now versus 20 years ago because we're certainly a lot of venture

142
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,960
capital sloshing around 20 years ago and 10 years ago. The difference now is that we can see

143
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:07,800
a cheaper cleaner, better ways to provide energy. And so we know as I said the beginning of this

144
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:15,400
podcast, we know the shape of these curves and economic curves. And once we know the shape

145
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,880
and we know that there's going to be an order of magnitude improvement, then that's the time to

146
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,520
push the go button. That's the time to start investing in these entrepreneurs. We're not afraid

147
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,280
of the things that are technically difficult. People come out all the time with business funds. We have

148
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,160
trouble understanding. We look in the encyclopedia. We look in the textbook. They've got some new

149
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,600
science. They've got some new technology. They're doing something in a different way than it's been

150
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,960
done before. It challenges existing order. Sometimes it challenges the limits of our understanding.

151
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,720
We're not afraid of that. It doesn't mean we're not going to vet it. We're going to get experts to

152
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,000
come in. We need to have credibility in the new idea. But the fact that it's hard and the fact that

153
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,840
it hasn't been done before is often the thing that feels the big opportunity to solve these big

154
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,240
problems. And so we thrive on that. Those are the kind of business plans we want to see the big

155
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,400
change the world kind of plans. But I think we're sitting on standstill road for many years and you're

156
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,800
seeing this dot com and that dot com and this semiconductor company. That's the semiconductor company.

157
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,800
And all of a sudden you started to see, I have a new way of cleaning water. I have a new way of

158
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:18,520
remediating this waste. I have a new way of taking a fuel cell and making energy much more efficiently

159
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,200
and cleanly. And we suddenly start to see, not just one, but a drum beat of these kinds of

160
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,000
innovations coming along. You realize the game's a foot. It's not just because there's a need.

161
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,440
It's because technology is providing an opportunity to do transformative businesses like

162
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,400
Netscape and Amazon and Google and to Nentech and Lotus and Compact. We're in their time

163
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,720
for their problem. This is a new time in a new problem. And these businesses are going to happen

164
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,680
now because the technology end the need are coming together at the same time. We're very fortunate that

165
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,120
that's true. How do you even contemplate doing diligence on all these opportunities?

166
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,760
You know, what kind of resources do you need to bring in to find out what has potential?

167
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:07,800
Well, we'd like to be involved in a industry at its very beginning. It's always better to back the

168
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,760
number one or number two player than the 10th or 11th. And so the partnership since the beginning

169
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:21,960
of the biotechnology industry, the distributed affordable, the personal computing industry,

170
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:31,640
the internet industries, networking industries has drawn on our ability to help entrepreneurs

171
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:39,960
with really terrific relevant operating and technical experience. As well as a strong and powerful

172
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:48,280
network of forward thinkers, scientists, consultants, and we're bringing that same network. That's

173
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,600
the same resources to bear in helping today's energy entrepreneurs. You know, innovation and

174
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,600
the energy industry we were marked earlier has been an option more on. There just has not been any

175
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:10,440
and all of a sudden because of advances in materials, in chemistry, in process. We can borrow from

176
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:17,880
many different fields, be they, high volume manufacturing, buttering, and depositions to make

177
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:26,040
possible innovations in energy innovations and transportation in the storage of really electrons

178
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:32,200
and the transformation of atoms. And we're moving, as I like to say, from a world that merely bits

179
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:39,160
and bytes to one of atoms and molecules controlled by the bits and bytes and the market for energy

180
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:46,120
is the largest of all those. We come back to a question you asked about how we actually do this

181
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,640
and what's important. John started out by answering, I think your first question about

182
00:17:51,640 --> 00:18:00,040
those being in the relationship and venture capital business, maintaining a network of experts

183
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:06,360
to deliver service to these entrepreneurs is our business. And you know, I would say that we

184
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,320
our partnership maintains a balance of technical depth and business skills, business and

185
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,360
economic skills so that we can balance the two of those. What are the right technological

186
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:26,920
bets, where the right economic bets that will both produce the best outcome in terms of technology

187
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:35,560
for society and also for a return on our investment. And then below that, you know, throughout

188
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:42,120
this network that we maintain, we have deep deep technical expertise and entrepreneurs that we

189
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:49,560
hope are passionate in their falling in love with the technologies that they produce.

190
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,360
We can't afford to totally fall in love with these, we've got to balance them in some way.

191
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,280
But we want to make sure this network delivers deep deep technical expertise and knowledge

192
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,640
about what we're about to invest in. You know, Ray, you mentioned something about 20 years ago

193
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,960
when there was a lot of the money floating around for alternative energy technologies.

194
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,080
In fact, I believe California, particular was probably the leader in solar energy in the

195
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:25,560
70s, also fueled coincidentally by a fuel crunch. And now the United States probably accounts for

196
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,400
less than 20% of those leading technologies. Where do you see the real pockets of innovation

197
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:38,360
taking place and maybe more specifically, is it solar, is it wind, is it biofuels, all of the above?

198
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:44,360
I think it's a lot going on in all of those. Bill may want to take a couple of them and just,

199
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,760
you know, paint a picture of what's going on, what we see is different today than in the past.

200
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:55,240
But we are seeing innovation in all of those fields. So we have to assess all of them

201
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,400
in parallel and try to make some assessment as to which one, you know, paint a picture of what's

202
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:06,520
going on, what we see is different today than in the past. But we're invested in battery technology

203
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:14,760
and more than one type of battery technology. We're invested in solar technology and more than

204
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,320
one type of solar technology. And so, and we try to make choices within each of those fields.

205
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:25,080
We're announcing this $100 million initiative, but we've come public with it only because

206
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:32,520
we believe over the last five years, gradually, but in an accelerating pace, we've been both

207
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:38,520
exposed to ideas from the best entrepreneurs and had the chance to back them in this field.

208
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:45,800
And as smart entrepreneurs will, they want to keep their ideas quiet or stealth as we put it

209
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,960
and fail they have products ready to offer to the market. And so we've made six significant

210
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:59,480
investments today. And several of those are now public show the kind of opportunity that there

211
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,600
is for innovation. Public in terms of the public in a sense that they're likely talking about

212
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,280
their efforts, recruiting people, offering products for sale. And then others are on the verge of

213
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,720
offering their services or products for sale. But they show they answer your question, which is

214
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,160
what are the markets like, what is the size of them and what kind of difference are they going

215
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,880
to make in our lives? You asked about solar. We're backing a venture called Mia Sole, which is

216
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:37,560
making flexible solar panels. They deposit solar material elements on flexible substrate, for

217
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:44,520
example stainless steel. Instead of putting it on expensive brittle silicon, a crystalline

218
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,360
surface that raises the cost of it. And the solar market sales for these modules, photovoltaic

219
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:59,320
modules grew 67% last year measured in megawatts. And over the last five years has been growing

220
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:07,960
over 40%. There's almost an insurmountable market demand right now for innovation in solar energy.

221
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,080
And having said that, so we get a sense of the size of these markets overall. Today solar electricity

222
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:20,520
generation accounts for less than 1% electricity generation worldwide. Another investment that we've

223
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:27,800
made is in a brilliant team out of MIT, who this venture is called Lillipcution. And they're making

224
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:36,440
tiny, but you do know all power, butteen power, the solid oxide fuel cells. And these are basically

225
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:44,760
rechargeable electrons generators, the size of a battery that you'd put in a laptop or a cell phone.

226
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,400
But instead of running for a few hours on a charge, the run for days on a charge. And when they're

227
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:56,040
through with that fuel from your cigarette lighter, butteen, you have a squirt more into the cell

228
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:05,240
and it just keeps on generating electricity. Three others are involved in energy storage to really

229
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,520
disruptive technologies with respect to today's batteries, which are well positioned for improvement.

230
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:21,080
And another large scale, solid oxide fuel cell project, together with an energy exploration

231
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:29,400
venture that can more effectively discover and harness bridges from the hydrocarbon economy

232
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:37,800
we're in today into a renewable economy. All told, renewable energy supplies less than 6%

233
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:45,080
of the world's consumption of energy. And of that renewables, the vast majority is hydroelectric

234
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:51,880
power. So there's a very, very large market opportunity that's right for innovation.

235
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:58,600
Before Bill, before you jump in on this, John may be a question since, as a team you oversee

236
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:05,960
lots of innovation, many things taking place. How about consumer adoption? Are you also investing

237
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:13,000
in the evangelism, the prophesizing, and really driving consumer adoption towards alternative

238
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,520
forms of, I will just say, let's call it energy in this case, or do you depend on the individual

239
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,920
companies and points of light take care of themselves in their own business plan?

240
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:29,080
If you look at the United States, energy and research uses is relatively efficient in the

241
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,320
industrial side. We've done a fairly good job of getting more efficient there, but it's really,

242
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:42,920
really been poor on the home consumer side. And we would love to find transformative tipping

243
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:49,160
business plans, technologies that could improve the efficiency and in-residence as throughout the

244
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:56,920
country. And that's a challenge, because people often look more to purchase costs than

245
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,360
like cycle cost of ownership. And so we have to find new business models in new ways of making

246
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,440
of that more intelligent decision happen. There are three ways to accelerate the adoption

247
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,880
of these technologies into markets. In many cases, they're invisible to consumers. And getting

248
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:22,840
an advanced battery adopted, for example, by Dell or a compact computers for their laptops,

249
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:29,560
that's the way the partnership can help by opening doors. The second is to recognize that

250
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:37,320
most of the markets for energy are regulated. And so there are government and policy

251
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:44,200
incentives that are today in place and that can be extended or made even stronger, whether they're

252
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:52,040
in the form of subsidies or clearing out regulatory underbrush that would either slow or hasten the

253
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:59,160
adoption of these. And we're very active on that front in helping companies get their innovations

254
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:05,080
and further research funded early markets of subsidized. The third and perhaps most important

255
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:13,000
is to select the kinds of innovations that are going to naturally appeal to consumers. And those

256
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,480
like the personal computer or like the revolution in podcasting are those that empower individuals.

257
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,840
And so the energy innovations we're involved with are those that are distributed. It's a kind of

258
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:32,360
personal energy. The same would be true of energy, storage, or of our efforts to find innovations

259
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,840
for clean water. They're not even ideal of enterprise software is going the same direction.

260
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:47,560
People that are individuals in an enterprise. So these are not mega wide innovations for cities

261
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:53,800
of 10 million people, except as they can be distributed spread around to villages to your home,

262
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:00,440
in your garage, into your personal electric vehicle. And I think that's one of the important

263
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:07,000
breakpoints between what used to be known is clean technology. And about over the last 10 years,

264
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,200
every year year and in year out about 6% of venture capital was invested in so-called clean

265
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,600
tech. That's not the field that excites us. We're excited about green tech, which conveys more of

266
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:28,920
the sustainability, distributed, personalized, and economically important, and green, think profit.

267
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:36,600
Excessed, sustainable elements of this new initiative. We think the time has come for this field to

268
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:45,880
get more than 6% of the worldwide R&D venture capital dollars. And we certainly intend to devote

269
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,400
more than 6% of client-ers funds to these kinds of innovation.

270
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:56,760
Well, one of the short answer to your question is, whatever it takes, we will invest in getting the word out

271
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:06,280
on the demand side as well, trying to help manage demand and bridge over to the new energy economies.

272
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:15,960
And I've heard my partners say many times that success is not enough. It has to be significant

273
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:23,960
that we have to leave behind something significant for the world. If you look at many of the

274
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,760
cleaner investments over the last 35 years that have been really good economic outcomes,

275
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,960
they've been more importantly significant for the world at large. And we are attempting to

276
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,280
announce new initiatives that will do the same thing over the next 20 years.

277
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,320
Where are the gaps? What are you missing? What are you looking for any types of companies or initiatives

278
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:52,280
or particular areas of invention? We're specifically looking very, very intensely right now for

279
00:28:52,600 --> 00:29:00,440
areas in the biofuels, initiatives in the biofuels area, whether they're biologically based or

280
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:07,560
chemically based, free processing, material that would be recyclable. I mean, where the carbon gets

281
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:15,400
recycled and doing that in a way that's very clean and has good economic and maintainability

282
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,240
parameters. And so it's the whole system design of how such initiatives would get put together.

283
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,840
And we've seen a lot of plants and we're still looking for one that's incredibly transformative

284
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,320
and are very excited to keep looking in this area. And we think there will be a number of great

285
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,360
ventures and hope to invest in several of them. Here's another example, Adam. We spoke about

286
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:47,240
build it about most of the least efficient uses of energy being in homes. 25% of the electricity

287
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,320
in homes is being used for lighting today. And so we anticipate. We've seen several proposals for real

288
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:00,680
revolutions that provide more economic lighting, longer-lived lighting, better control lighting,

289
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:08,840
and significantly lower energy consumption. The field is wide open. We want to see entrepreneurs

290
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:15,960
or better said teams, great teams that can think through and take technology and apply its

291
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:22,440
leverage. We know now that in the next 10 years there are great possibilities to apply technology

292
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,720
leverage to deliver an order of magnitude improvement on any of these cost models that we

293
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:34,120
are driven by today. And the John also has, I think, made the point several times,

294
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:40,440
imping upon our national security at times. The last thing I would say is, go to our website.

295
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,160
There's instructions there for how to send us, send us, send us your great ideas, come visit.

296
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:51,000
We want to see the plants. We look at new things every day and we want to see lots of great ideas

297
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
in these areas. We know that they're out there. We know they're more than they were seeing.

298
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,560
We want to see more. Bring them bring us your great ideas. I think one thing we didn't touch upon

299
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:06,600
as well is a lot of the really great ideas come from the great universities around the world.

300
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:12,120
This country, we have a lot of great universities doing a lot of research. I mean, really great

301
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:19,400
research and connecting. It is our job, our mission to connect with those research teams and

302
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,200
eventual entrepreneurs for that research that comes out of those universities. And so we want to

303
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:30,520
continue to network with those great research universities because that's where a lot of the

304
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:37,560
baseline work is going on that we'll see the results of in the next 10 years in the new

305
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:44,040
energy economy. Please know that you can come and you can come to us with an idea.

306
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:50,120
You don't need a business plan. You don't need the management team. You don't need the laser

307
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:56,600
like focus on an unserved market opportunity. At the beginning of the biotechnology industry,

308
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,360
there were two scientists, Boyer and Cohen in one of our partners Bob Swanson was reading one of

309
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,000
their research papers and took them out for a beer these two of them. And we backed them to the

310
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,880
tune of $10,000 a month to conduct an experiment in their labs and to write a business plan for

311
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:20,440
what became Genentech, a leader, 120 billion dollar market value. In the worldwide biotechnology

312
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:30,520
industry, there will be, in our opinion, several, if not many, Genentech's and Google's and

313
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:37,000
some micro systems and Oracle's really great, big, durable, global companies who can serve

314
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:44,680
the needs for innovation. In this, perhaps the largest of all our markets, the needs for

315
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:51,480
clean water, clean power, clean transportation. The largest single trend on this planet over the

316
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,680
next 50 years, everyone agrees is urbanization. We're going to triple the number of people living

317
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:02,840
in large cities from $2 billion to $6 billion people. Think of that. That's going to be the

318
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:09,240
equivalent of creating eight cities every year larger than Manhattan. And so the innovation isn't

319
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:15,400
just happening in the United States, it's happening all over the world. Great innovation in bio

320
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:23,320
fuels, bio diesel, for example, in Europe, tremendous demands for efficiency and conservation throughout

321
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,720
all of Asia and the markets are also good. So we're open for business and are called to the

322
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,920
world to innovators and entrepreneurs to visit the Cleaner Perkins, a co-field buyers website.

323
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:46,120
It's www.atpcb.com. Yeah, I'd say go to kpcb.com. Look at the descriptions of our initiatives,

324
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,840
look at the biographies of the partners, pick one of us who matches up with your ideas, send us an

325
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,520
email, describe your idea, tell us your new technology, your new way of doing business, your way of

326
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,160
getting things adopted, and we'll get back to you and let's start a dialogue and see if we can

327
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,600
change the world together. So that's what I'd call quite an invitation. Now if you

328
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,160
made it all the way to the end of this interview, then you'll know what I meant by kind of a

329
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:16,840
very interesting type of advertisement. There's Bill Joy, a legend in Silicon Valley, inviting

330
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:23,960
you to change the world together with him. Fantastic. Well, anyway, I hope you enjoyed that.

331
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,640
I plan, that's one of my private promises to myself. I plan on doing a lot more interviews in 2007,

332
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:34,520
and I will not probably put them on a different feed. I'm just going to make it all part of the daily

333
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,120
source code because it's not what it's all about. Aren't you supposed to build a do whatever you

334
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,000
want to do? So I shall do just that. And a reminder that portions of today's show are brought to you

339
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,840
I hope. We want more business from down people. All right, I will be back tomorrow with

340
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,200
probably another best of Charlie, which of course I'll give you an update on the big movie 2007,

341
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,360
and have yourselves a great rest of Sunday afternoon. Or if you're on Australia, tomorrow. Bye.
