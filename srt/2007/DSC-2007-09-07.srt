1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
It's the DSC 661.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,280
Some people listen for the music.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,200
Some people listen for news on technology, news on podcasting.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,520
Some people listen because they're just big fans of Adam Curry.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,520
Then they're those who listen in the hope that Carmen Tyler will call in again.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,920
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,920
You can find her at CarmenTiler.com, but you'll find the DSC 661 right here.

8
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,920
And now it's gold and you're all over your attack.

9
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Now that we're all and you there was not turning back.

10
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,920
And my heart erased and I thought what could it do?

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,920
And I knew there was no hell.

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,920
No hell for you.

13
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,920
Sara down the clouds.

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

15
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,920
But find that room down.

16
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Turn me apart.

17
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

18
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

19
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

20
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

21
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

22
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

23
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

24
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

28
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

29
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

30
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

31
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

32
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

33
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

34
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,920
You can't fit me in my heart.

35
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

James Osco, Amy, and Thunder.

40
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,120
It's a football flat, everybody.

41
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,000
It's a maximum music Friday edition.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,040
In a world where TV networks, movie studios,

43
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,520
and record labels, still think they can govern

44
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,960
what you see in here.

45
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,720
One man has the power to return control

46
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,520
of entertainment to the masses

47
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,760
and make big media corporations

48
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,440
wet their tiny little pants.

49
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,240
From Pod Show, home of the world's most dangerous

50
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,240
new content comes the daily source code with Adam Curry.

51
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,560
There are many things in life that I have learned.

52
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,400
Like respect cannot be bought, it must be earned.

53
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,520
I have learned that Toggy's cheap.

54
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,520
I look before I leap and I sniff the milk to see if it has turned.

55
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,200
But there's one thing that remains unnecessary.

56
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,040
And it seems that I am just too blind to see.

57
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,720
You know, they say one guy in ten prefers the company of men.

58
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,840
But why do people think that one is me?

59
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,040
I feel pretty single line.

60
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,600
Why do people think I'm gay?

61
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,240
Is it something that I say?

62
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,880
Am I campus like a fan?

63
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,480
Is it my love of Doris Day?

64
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,240
Why do people think I'm gay?

65
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
Not that that isn't okay?

66
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,880
But let me ask you if I may, why do people think I'm gay?

67
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,520
Don't get me wrong, it's cool, this world takes different strokes.

68
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Different strokes.

69
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,920
But personally, I just don't fancy blokes.

70
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,120
Fancy blokes.

71
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,840
You know, there's no enjoyment, finer.

72
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,120
Then to play with a lady's special place.

73
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,240
At least, that's what I often tell my fault.

74
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,440
It's what I always do.

75
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,200
So why do people think I'm gay?

76
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,800
Is it the way that I say, Shae?

77
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Each time I hear why I'm C.A.

78
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,480
With my nipples on display.

79
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,720
Okay, I'm sensitive, but I like ten neatly dressed.

80
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,520
Need me dressed.

81
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,880
And yes, I own a fitted like her best.

82
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,560
It's just for joking.

83
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,880
So I'm most surprised, my face.

84
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,720
And I'm a fan of will and grace.

85
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,320
And I wish my girlfriend had a hair richer.

86
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,040
But why do people think I'm gay?

87
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,720
Has my libido gonna stray?

88
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,440
I blame it on my uncle Ray.

89
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,040
And that thing would be day.

90
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,640
How the people know I'm gay.

91
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,440
And they met my friend Jose.

92
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,080
And now I have to find a way to tell my fiance.

93
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,960
You know, everybody, I just had to play that for you.

94
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,840
I heard that this morning on a B.T.

95
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,720
He pod shows traces of nuts of fine show that you must check out, I'll put a link

96
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,000
in the show notes, just cracking me up and I was listening to it.

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I think I may be gay.

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,920
It is September 7th, 2007.

99
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
It is Friday.

100
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,840
We're winding down the week here in California.

101
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,520
I actually just went back to the condo, but I know it is the recording studio.

102
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,200
After my little football Friday celebration at the office at 6.15 in the evening.

103
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,520
All I got to do to need tonight is go out and have some dinner.

104
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,440
It's about it and I'm just going to chill watch some TV and retire early tomorrow.

105
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
I got to stay inside.

106
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,000
I got to create a whole presentation for this conference.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,560
I'm speaking out in San Diego on Monday, leaving for San Diego Sunday evening.

108
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,840
So a little bit of traveling over the weekend.

109
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,800
And to get us all in the mood, what makes you travel the best?

110
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,200
Well, there's only one thing that makes you travel best.

111
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
It's young, let's hit test.

112
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,960
I'm proud to be casting with Adam Curry.

113
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,680
Hey, Adam, you ready to be stumps?

114
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,320
Hell yeah.

115
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Does he use the good test?

116
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Hey, Adam.

117
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Hey, Adam.

118
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Hey, Adam.

119
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Hi, doing this.

120
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,320
He just hit this number 86 and we're going to start right away with intro.

121
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Number one.

122
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
Pick it.

123
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:26,800
That sounds like it sounds like Elton John, Kiki D.

124
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,680
Don't go break in my heart.

125
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,360
That's sure, but it sounds like it.

126
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,160
And this is number two.

127
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Easy one.

128
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,800
John, you are rolling out the Friday hits aren't you?

129
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Forner.

130
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,240
I want to know what love is.

131
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,800
Is my guess for number two in the head test.

132
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,400
And the final one is number three.

133
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,120
Is that Bruce Horns being the range?

134
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,800
I think it's Bruce Horns being.

135
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
I think so.

136
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,880
What's your time's up in these are the answers?

137
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Oh, yeah.

138
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
This is answer number one from 1976.

139
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Who are you?

140
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,880
I'm going to break in my heart.

141
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,040
I couldn't invite, try.

142
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Who?

143
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:16,520
Nobody knows it, nobody showin' over us down.

144
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,360
How was your clown?

145
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
Oh.

146
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,720
I'll give you my heart.

147
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
What?

148
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Nice.

149
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,440
From 1976, Alton John and Kiki D.

150
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,280
And don't go breaking my heart.

151
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,120
And this is answer number two from 1984.

152
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
This is forner.

153
00:09:40,120 --> 00:10:09,560
I want to know what love is.

154
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,280
And this is the third and final answer for this week's hit test.

155
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,720
In 1986, Bruce Horns were in the range.

156
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,120
And that's just the way it is.

157
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Way it is.

158
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,520
Still in line, long in time, waiting for the verdant.

159
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,720
Just funny, says, get a job.

160
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,920
That's just the way it is.

161
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,000
That's just the way.

162
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,840
This concludes hit test number 86.

163
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,320
Three tracks from way back again.

164
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,320
One from the 70s and two from the 80s.

165
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,720
They were not very difficult.

166
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
No.

167
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,160
The first one was kinda, I guess, because of the very short intro.

168
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,760
All right Adam, I hope you liked these ones.

169
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Love them.

170
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,440
Did you hit them all right?

171
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Almost.

Bye-bye.

180
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,960
Oh, young man, I feel like I immediately want to rush off and go buy all of those songs

181
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,080
at the iTunes Music Store.

182
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,640

Thank you.

185
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,800
I think I got two and a half out of three stars.

186
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,800
I couldn't remember, and I forgotten the name of the song again.

187
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,040
Bruce Horn's being the range.

188
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,560
Whatever happened to Bruce Horn's be.

189
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,320
Whatever happened to the range for that matter.

190
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,080
I mean, come on.

191
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,280
What's going on here?

192
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,080
Oh, yes.

193
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,720
Maximum music from our Friday is on.

00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,800

195
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Come on in my brother.

196
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
The door is up at him.

197
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,920
This is Jay Mag from hoodhype.com.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
I notice you don't play much hip hop on your show.

199
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,960
So I brought my buddy's major in fro and here today.

200
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,240
It's so white.

201
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,560
This is what I do, man.

202
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,280
We got a track.

203
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,440
I'm going to let major intro the track for you, but, and hopefully,

204
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,720
maybe we can make this a regular thing, but check this out.

205
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,400
What's up, Adam?

206
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,320
This is Major Man.

207
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,920
Listen to your podcast.

208
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,560

211
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,360
I love to hear a little bit more hip hop on my show.

212
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,880
This is the artist I think you will feel his name is Quest.

213
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,200
He's out of Bronx, New York.

214
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,480
The name of his track is called All My Soul.

215
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,640
Check it out.

216
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640

Uh, let's go.

285
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,380

Had a lot better.

287
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,800
Oh, man.

288
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,060
For the dinner that shocked the next day.

289
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,680
Life is in funny sweets.

290
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,120
They always told me sake though but I spend like money stains.

291
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,980
My life is like a wonder wave tank, for the funny stick.

292
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,700
I'm so hungry even if they'd come off your rummy kicks.

293
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,240
My manager had a beautiful upbeat baby, a name the kind of spark.

294
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,200
Why he was working over time? She died in the fire. That's saying we time was just telling me drugs

295
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,080
It's tight and so it's last break, but that damn custody was wide

296
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,480
My man just graduated college was crazy on us and dedicated his degree to his pops in his momma

297
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,080
He was happy you left the home when I go through drama

298

I saw the brain he got killed while drunk and dropper remember 10 from down the block

I feel you now a bit

305
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,440
When I think about the life that I believe my ass hurt my eyes beat my hip jerk

306
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,360
How I feel need work you ever felt the pain to my point when you need church

307
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,280
And many soldiers captured in the past up the steelburg feel like people still broke

308
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,120
And reals I feel jerks still nailed the film her like a shield that kills worse

309
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,160
I never thought my you forget drill by ill curse because abuse went on to tell like a seal that's still

They're the rest the block of trash get your heart again

Looking for a young Elvis sound alike for the lost Elvis Diaries Mark Namcoff and I have been scouring

329
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
High and low and finally some calls are coming in

330
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,640

Minimal name starts with a and your first name starts with a that's that's pretty good in it

334
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Well, I got to

335
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,480
But looking for work. I've been hiding that everywhere

336
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,880
Since my mom and I I really haven't had a lot to do

337
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,800
So if you still live in for somebody 11 oh just give me a shout out

I get that all back and not the bad not bad there's more coming in

339
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
How to Mr. Curry. It's Elvis calling

340
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,440
I hear another color on your show when I knew I could do much better job in him

341
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,920
Now I don't fancy myself in Elvis in person either and I I won't never as big as fame

342
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
But I can't sing like him and

343
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,920
Brooks had been telling me all my wrath that I'm greeted in the taking people so I had to give it a shake

344
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,240
I've been a state home doubt if I've been using the sun just want off the school for the first time

345
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,480
Is city a promise myself when it did I was going to try to explore some of my God given talents and

346
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,280
See if I can make it if it happened before I got to go off and get a date job. You know

347
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,360
I'm gonna let Mark Namcoff decide on these

348
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm not sure I like the first one a little bit better in this one. It's kind of hard though

349
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,760
You know, it's it's a real acting gig. It's a real paying gig. It's it's really something you can you can bank on

350
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,320
So Jerry still out feel free to call in

351
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
Let me know if you think you are the biggie

352
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,720
1 2 1 6 2 5 6 3 5 7

353
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,720
1 1 2 1 6 2 5 6 3 5 7

354
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
Is James longtime friend of the Charlie

355
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Mr. Corriots James

356
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,520
I'm not that's a good news for you

357
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,120
I think I taste good news. There's anybody from the BBC listening

358
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,600
It's a very very carefully

359
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
I shall say this only once

360
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
I've just got the best of today

361
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,840
BBC radio or for news program

362
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,400
Don't lord it and to my surprise that program was 45 minutes long

363
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,720
Usually about that you have between five and 15 minutes 45 minutes on and it's subject is lechioro

364
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Poverock which is very sad

365
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,280
Yeah, I don't know the podcast and I think now

366
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,080
I'll listen to this a general news program

367
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,800
You know how bad kids are doing all that kind of shape and then right at the end

368
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,720
The talk about the channel Poverock again and how it's very sad is died and then we get

369
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,840
No, no, no, no, no, yes, the play of the entire hookin song oops

370
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:05,040
I don't even know that you may say put there just a message to them and probably

371
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Mr. Poverock is record company

372
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,680
Yes, I will be going to iTunes today, and yes, I will be purchasing some more Poverocky because

373
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,120
I don't actually have any on my iPod and I've just realized how good he actually was

374
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,240
Which is a shame because he's gone no, but that's the score you just played with so many events

375
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:37,280
By the way, I'm sure it was a mistake the BBC did that, but I don't really mind because I think

376
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,880
Personally, I think this falls into up-sol organization for the preservation to the soundtrack of our lives

377
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,680
And it is newsworthy it's educational and my good buddy the satellite repair man P W

378
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,320
Fenton was thinking along the exact same lines

379
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,760
And send me this

380
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,160
No

381
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:26,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

382
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:56,160
oh, oh, oh,

383
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:18,600
oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Hey, Billy, because of Barry, he's just a hundred.

384
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:29,120
Siguensio da di famio

385
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:47,440
He

386
00:22:47,440 --> 00:23:15,040
the

387
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:25,440
The Master, the Channel Poverty,

388
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,440
and just a small piece from Nessandorma,

389
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
with thanks to PWFent.

390
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
Damn.

391
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
I gotta tell you,

392
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
what a loss.

393
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
What a loss.

394
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,440
And please don't tell me that your favorite radio station

395
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
played that in its entirety

396
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
because they did not.

397
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
They don't do that anymore.

398
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
They'll just play the last bit.

399
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
Which is also coincidentally,

400
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
this song has been award-winning

401
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
for several contestants,

402
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
and I think, like,

403
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,440
pop idol and ex-factor,

404
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
or whatever.

405
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,440
And all those the guys who are doing

406
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
are good,

407
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,440
nothing compares to this.

408
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
What a tragic loss.

409
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
What a fantastic voice.

410
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
Speaking of pop idol, by the way.

411
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
I did I tell you,

412
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
this Patricia noticed this.

413
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
So we were watching,

414
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I think the most recent series

415
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
started in the UK.

416
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
I recorded the episode

417
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
and I saved it.

418
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
So when I get back,

419
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
remind me,

420
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
please, and I'll dig it up.

421
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,440
Talk about your deception.

422
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
There was a contest,

423
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
and you know how it works,

424
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
right?

425
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
They do their audition,

426
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
and then you have to have four

427
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
yeses before you can carry on.

428
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
So it was a dennymanogue

429
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,440
who, by the way, is looking kind of hot.

430
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
It's a Louis,

431
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
and Simon Cowell, of course,

432
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
and Sharon Osborne.

433
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,440
And so I forget exactly who it was,

434
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,440
but they have to go down the line.

435
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
It was, you know,

436
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
it was a yes, yes,

437
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
a no,

438
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
and then it was Sharon's turn,

439
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
and she had to say either yes or no

440
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
for this contestant to carry on.

441
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
And she said no.

442
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
And Patricia, who's sitting next to me,

443
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
says, hey, hold on a second.

444
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
Back that up.

445
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
Rewind that,

446
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
which of course I can do,

447
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
because we got the nifty digital

448
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
sky box, right?

449
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
So I back it up.

450
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
She says, her clothes changed.

451
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
What are you talking about?

452
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,440
So we backed it up and low and behold.

453
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Yeah, it's really amazing.

454
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
You see the four of them sitting there.

455
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Sharon has kind of like a,

456
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
like a hoodie, a black hoodie,

457
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
gray sweatshirt thing going on.

458
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,440
And the minute she says no,

459
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
she's actually wearing a freely white shirt.

460
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
It's like it's half a second,

461
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
just a word no.

462
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
And boom, they cut away from her.

463
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,440
So the big question is why did they do that?

464
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
For some reason,

465
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
they did not let this person go on to the next round.

466
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,440
And the way they did it was really sneaky.

467
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
But something is a foot,

468
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
my friends,

469
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
and I guarantee you,

470
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
I will find out.

471
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,440
That's what it is.

472
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
I'll do it with that.

473
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
Hi.

474
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
I'm on this week's show.

475
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
We've got a review of Dragon Ball's E.

476
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
The new trading card game for the DS.

477
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,440
We've got a review of stuntman ignition for the 360.

478
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,440
An interesting new game called Dublob.

479
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
We've got a preview of that for the Wii,

480
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
and you can win overlord for the Xbox 360.

481
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
All of that, of course,

482
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,440
you can check out at gamesweasel.btpodshow.com.

483
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,440
You're outer.

484
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,440
I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out

485
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,440
You're on her, please don't bang that gavel

486
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,440
You can try this cowbell out

487
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Let's all give a nod

488
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,440
To the hardest work and lawyer

489
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,440
It's Jersey time, man, man

490
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,440
It's Jersey time

491
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Yo, how's it going Adam? It's Jersey time

492
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,440
The official musicologist of the Chacha

493
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,440
Have I got a band for you this week?

494
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,440
In fact, it's one of my personal favorites

495
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,440
The band is named Jaco Pierce

496
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
They're out of Texas

497
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,440
And when I was in law school in Delaware

498
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
I had like only a few albums

499
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
And I got to be honest

500
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,440
I played this Jaco Pierce album over and over and over again

501
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
So in a lot of ways

502
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,440
It's fair to say that Jaco Pierce helped make me a lawyer

503
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
I love these guys

504
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,440
They have a wonderful, cool acoustic sound

505
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,440
And their song vineyard is perfect for the end of the summer

506
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,440
They talk about a girl with mahogany hair

507
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,440
And amnith this dies

508
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,440
And it's just an absolutely perfect track

509
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
Check this out

510
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,440
This is one of my favorite bands called Jaco Pierce

511
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
On The Daily Source Code

512
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
So excited to play this for you

513
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,440
It's six o'clock now in the morning

514
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,440
As I wait for my train to come

515
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,440
To take me somewhere just outside of Boston

516
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,440
As I run to find the other song

517
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,440
And I'm leaving my way high

518
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,440
And then I can't talk about just more pain

519
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,440
Than this heart and hand can use

520
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
As this big world I was spinning

521
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
All that I thought I was winning

522
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,440
I'd never thought I'd never thought I'd do

523
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,440
This great force it takes me to the ferry

524
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,440
To cross land and water so I'll take

525
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,440
And I'm on that ship my life just seems so very

526
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,440
Small and comparison to everything around

527
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
But there's this girl over there

528
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,440
She's got mahogany hair

529
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,440
And her eyes of sweet out my face

530
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
I bow as she curses

531
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
Doesn't look like she's gonna hurt me

532
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,440
So I decide to write it to my lips

533
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
She said

534
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,440
She said

535
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,440
She stayed on the phone for a summer

536
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,440
And she stayed on the venue for me

537
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,440
We'll find the last time we're in our club

538
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,440
And that children is all the way

539
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,440
We'll find the last time we're in our club

540
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,440
We'll find the last time we're in our club

541
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
We'll find the last time we're in our club

542
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,440
We'll find the last time we're in our club

543
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,440
We'll find the last time we're in our club

544
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,440
We'll find the last time we're in our club

545
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,440
We'll find the last time we're in our club

546
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,440
Seems now that I should be going

547
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,440
As that one day turned into five or six

548
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,440
All the while I'm loving all the beautiful things she's showing

549
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,440
I back up and I'm enveloping by the means

550
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,440
That girl over there she's got mahogany hair

551
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,440
And her eyes of sweet out my face

552
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,440
I think that maybe it would be better

553
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,440
If I just wrote her a letter

554
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,440
But instead she grabs me in my chest

555
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,440
And she's saying you ain't going nowhere

556
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Stay on the venue for the summer

557
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,440
Won't you stay on the venue for the year?

558
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,440
We'll find the last time we're in our club

559
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,440
And that children is all the way

560
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Once again, Josie Todd does not disappoint

561
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
Sir Todd brings it on home

562
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,440
From the Pods Egg Music Network, Jackal Pierce

563
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,440
And of course, links in the show notes

564
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Work today's program

565
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Which is the maximum music football Friday

566
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,440
Find it at dailysourcecode.com

567
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,440
Nice

568
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,440
Kind of strumming on the Friday

569
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,440
No count in the curry condo

570
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Yeah, yeah, I like it man

571
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
I like it

572
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,440
Happy football Friday everybody

573
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,440
It's Marcus couch from the scene scene

574
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
Here with a fat sack of the good stuff

575
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,440
Let's rock one out here on football Friday

576
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,440
This is how I pay the rent on the scene scene

577
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
If you're into this kind of music

578
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Check out more at the scenes scene.com

579
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,440
This is one less reason

580
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,440
And the track is really bad analogy

581
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,440
For you go that you could call those people friends

582
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,440
You lie right to my face

583
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,440
You spent me to believe it

584
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,440
You said you'd rather walk away

585
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Let me fall to appreciate

586
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Cause I know it would fail

587
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,440
The salty catastrophe of major betrayal

588
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,440
But getting disaster

589
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,440
You're walking no matter

590
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,440
Struggling long as I dream

591
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,440
And I'll give you a chance

592
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,440
For me to give you a chance

593
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,440
To be free like I can see

594
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
In your eyes

595
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,440
No lie ever

596
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,440
Leave the lost in your heart

597
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
Feel it in my hand

598
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,440
See it in your eyes

599
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,440
And no matter how you say

600
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,440
The tide of this place

601
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,440
You're so sick of my face

602
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,440
But I shouldn't wait around on you

603
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,440
And I know that you won't show

604
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Sometimes we all just need

605
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Softens to believe

606
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Something so much more than you

607
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,440
Something so much more than you

608
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Cause I knew it would fail

609
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,440
The salty catastrophe of major betrayal

610
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,440
But getting disaster

611
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,440
You're walking no matter

612
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,440
Struggling long as I dream

613
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,440
I'll give you a chance

614
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,440
For me to give you a chance

615
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,440
To be free like I can see

616
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
In your eyes

617
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,440
No lie ever

618
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,440
Leave the lost in your heart

619
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
Feel it in my hand

620
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,440
See it in your eyes

621
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,440
And no matter how you say

622
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,440
The tide of this place

623
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
You're so sick of my face

624
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,440
And no matter how you say

625
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,440
The tide of this place

626
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
You're so sick of my face

627
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,440
But I shouldn't wait around on you

628
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
And I know that you won't show

629
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
Sometimes we all just need to

630
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
And I know that you won't show

631
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,440
This alone the baby you are strong

632
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,440
You have a weak like me

633
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
And I know it would be

634
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,440
From the choices you made of

635
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
A prince on the back

636
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,440
And a flower of a face for the day

637
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,440
You're the day I'm trying to smile

638
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,440
Because I knew it would fail

639
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,440
The salty catastrophe of major betrayal

640
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
But getting disaster

641
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,440
You're walking no matter

642
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
Struggling long as I dream

643
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,440
And I know that you won't show

644
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,440
You're the day I'm trying to smile

645
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,440
When you've seen

646
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,440
Until we're not getting sick

647
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
And no matter how you say

648
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,440
The tide of this place

649
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,440
You're so sick of my face

650
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,440
And no matter how you say

651
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
The tide of this place

652
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,440
You're so sick of my face

653
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Now I can see it in your eyes

654
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
And no matter how you say

655
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
The tide of this place

656
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,440
I'm going to write through a party on Fridays, my friends show up, bring in gifts.

657
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,440
Like us, Kyle, you can see and see.

658
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
We are rocking through knocking.

659
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,440
I don't think we should be stopping because it's the Blue Bar Friday.

660
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Maximum music edition. Keep it coming though.

661
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,440
This is Rick from the Rock by Three Shots Podcast.

662
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,440
Here's a great song from the Podsake music network by a great band who played this summer's Warp Tour.

663
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,440
This is Mayday Parade with Jamie Allover.

664
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,440
I had a dream last night, we drove out to see Las Vegas.

665
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,440
We look ourselves in the bright lights.

666
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:10,440
I wish you could have seen us, but you'd be changed to get home.

667
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,440
I'll release it when it's school.

668
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,440
But put it said on the high tide.

669
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,440
I'd spend a summer on the white couch.

670
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:28,440
I was just going to sing a song from the Podsake music network by a great band who played this summer's Warp Tour.

671
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,440
But we are rocking through knocks.

672
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,440
This is the Black Friday.

673
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
This is the Black Friday.

674
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,440
We have a song from the Podsake music network by a great band who played this summer's Warp Tour.

675
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
So let's go!

676
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:48,440
I've been wanting what to dream another such that we'll be able to find you all over

677
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:58,440
When it's over, I'll take this cabin sun ride with me, and wake up with the formation of memories

678
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:05,440
We may love our the ocean, as the waves cast throughout the ocean

679
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:14,440
So it's never we're so bright, and this guy's never so blue, to open up into my arms

680
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:23,440
And we laughed as I held you, I'll never go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to

681
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,440
To the land, to the land, to the land, to the place you're putting it down

682
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,440
To the land, to the earth, to the earth, to the ocean

683
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:46,440
So it's never we're so bright, and this guy's never so blue, to open up into my arms

684
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,440
And we'll dream another such that we'll be able to find you all over

685
00:37:52,440 --> 00:38:06,440
When it's over, I'll take this cabin sun ride with me, and wake up with the formation of memories

686
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:13,440
We may love our the ocean, as the waves cast throughout the ocean

687
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,440
So it's never we're so bright, and this guy's never so blue, to open up into my arms

688
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:27,440
And we laughed as I held you, I'll never go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia

689
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:57,440
I'll never go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back

690
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:27,440
to Georgia, not at least until I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least until I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia, not at least till I have to go back to Georgia,

691
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,160
I've got to be honest with you. I forgot what their name was already. It's going to be a bitch doing show notes today because

692
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,000
Nothing in the ID three tags and that means I have to go back and

693
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,080
I'm listening to all the intros again to figure out what the hell I've played.

694
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,440
Hey for those of you who tuned into the daily source code to hear more of Carmen Tyler's sexy

695
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,640
Sultry voice. I would not want to disappoint. Hey, this is Carmen Tyler from the Carmen cast

696
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:56,560
and I wanted to talk to all the podcasters out there who are going to be attending the podcast Expo

697
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,120
in the next couple of weeks in Ontario, California. Kind of coming up quickly.

698
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,040
But I want to invite everyone to a worship service that we're going to have on Sunday morning,

699
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,920
September 30th. It's going to be 8 o'clock in the morning in Ballroom A. I think it's going to be an

700
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,000
awesome time with the word and I'm going to be there and I'm going to help lead some

701
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,360
present worship and then we're going to have a really awesome sermon by Jimmy Bradshaw. So I would

702
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,920
love to see everyone come and just we can all get together and praise the word and I'm

703
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,640
really excited about what God's going to do at this service. I got to tell you that's a great idea,

704
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:42,720
really is. If I do make it out to the Expo Carmen, I promise I'm coming to the service.

705
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,120
Just to slow down the mood a little bit for your Friday. This is Terrence Blunt's Shard

706
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,720
and Dear Mom.

707
00:42:51,120 --> 00:43:21,120
Thank you so much for your support, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much, I love you so much

708
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:26,240
with thanks to Sir Jersey Todd, for sending the pointer to the Pod Save Music Network,

709
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,440
oh yeah, turn off one shot, not an unknown my friends, dear mom, and when I heard that, I could

710
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,920
tell, I knew exactly what kind of emotion was going into that song, very, very nice, okay,

711
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,840
what's going on this weekend, the big MTV Video Music Awards, which is kind of funny these

712
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,320
days, what they should really do is they should bring on the shows, they really in the video,

713
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:53,360
they really put on that network, bring some of those crappy sweet 16 kids that you want to

714
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:58,080
punch in the face, you know, let's bring out the paint my ride guys, you know, all that stuff,

715
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,400
they don't play anymore music on MTV, and it's true that they're, or it's clear that they're

716
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,040
completely clueless, what is the big star they've got, they're bringing back Britney Spears,

717
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,280
yeah, it'll get your ratings, it'll pop the ratings up a little bit, I'm sure lots of people

718
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,200
are interested in that, but man, you have alienated your core audience so horribly,

719
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,160
oh I'd be, it's just lame, it's just completely lame,

720
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,480
all right, what do we got? 44 minutes, not bad, it's Friday,

721
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:35,520
one day Tuesday, Wednesday, food about Friday, Adam's final fun on the Wii, well,

722
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,640
the only final thoughts I have for this week, which of course, has been kind of weird

723
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,400
with the passing of our lovely, lovely cat, you almost want to say child, I mean,

724
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:54,000
you love them so much, remember of the family Cindy, and by the way, they had the girls had a

725
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,600
beautiful ceremony for him, buried him in the back in the woods and got a nice little

726
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,760
grave set up with the flowers and everything, I'll get a picture of it and I'll post it up when

727
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,400
I get back home, which by the way will not be for another week, more than a week, even this is the

728
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:15,760
mega marathon stay out here, could not be worse timing. Fortunately, I got lots of friends and those

729
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,480
of you listening, you're it, and I really do appreciate all the beautiful thoughts you've sent to me

730
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,960
and to Patricia and Christina, it really, really has made a difference, I'm not kidding,

731
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,560
it's I'm sure that when I get home, the lady Patricia will want to be on the show and show

732
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,880
I want to thank you personally, I'm quite, quite convinced of it, so that's really my final

733
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,560
thought is that I got a lot of people to thank and even though life brings this

734
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,040
sour grapes once in a while it brings us good times, sometimes it does just bring us bad times,

735
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:54,080
but there's always one golden rule you can hold on to because trust me my friends,

736
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,920
it's going to be all right.

737
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:35,600
And I'll tell you where I love you, don't tell back on me no more, I love for you, it's all all

738
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:54,720
fun, you're it's all I'm waiting for, you're gonna break my heart when you will fall

739
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:04,400
you're my own forever, you're gonna break my heart, what's gonna be all right

740
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:15,680
when you're on my side, don't let you hide, don't let you hide, don't let you hide

741
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:24,480
all right when you're on my side, don't let you hide

742
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,400
what's gonna be all right

743
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:37,680
don't hold on me no more, I love for you, don't let you hide

744
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:46,320
and stay until my dying day, you're gonna want to stay instead

745
00:47:46,320 --> 00:48:01,840
into my world, because all I want to be is say, baby, baby, you're gonna break my heart

746
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:17,520
when you will fall, forever, you're my own forever, you're gonna break my heart, what's gonna be all right

747
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:39,200
don't let you hide, don't let you hide, don't let you hide, what's gonna be all right

748
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,440
