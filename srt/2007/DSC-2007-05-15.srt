1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,260
From the Curie Manor, Gilford, UK, from the Curie condo, San Francisco, more from the Curie

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,800
cockpit of the skies above, wherever Adam might be, there's always the Daily Source

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,800
Code.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,760
This is episode number 601 with Adam Curie.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:31,040
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next Generation Radio

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:38,040
content in my ears, I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Something in my mind, I've been there taking time to shoot a song for you now.

8
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Taking a song now, the guy not been so wrong to shoot a song for you now.

9
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Taking a song now, the guy not been so wrong to shoot a song for you now.

10
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Taking a song now, the guy not been so wrong to shoot a song for you now.

11
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Taking a song now, the guy not been so wrong to shoot a song for you now.

12
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,040
Taking a song now, the guy not been so wrong to shoot a song for you now.

13
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Taking a song now, the guy not been so wrong to shoot a song for you now.

14
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Taking a song now, the guy not been so wrong to shoot a song for you now.

15
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Something in my mind, I've been there taking time to shoot a song for you now.

16
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Taking a song now, the guy not been so wrong to shoot a song for you now.

17
00:02:52,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Taking a song now, the guy not been so wrong to shoot a song for you now.

18
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Taking a song now, the guy not been so wrong to shoot a song for you now.

19
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Taking a song, the guy not been so wrong to shoot a song for you now.

20
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Taking a song, the guy not been so wrong to shoot a song for you.

21
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,620
Kind of interesting.

22
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,620
There we go.

23
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,080
Yeah, you know, I saw it pop up on, on Podger's Music Spotlight, which you could find

24
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,800
at poncho.com slash music and I'm like, yeah, yeah, that's actually pretty cool.

25
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,960
Do need to haircut though, big time.

26
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,640
This is what Spin Magazine said about Pop-Leave-I, and I quote,

27
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,320
equal parts psychedelia and glam, Pop-Leave-I, channel such

28
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,800
formable front men as Robert Plant, Mark Bowlin, and Prince.

29
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,880
Whoa, that coming from Spin.

30
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,240
Not a lot of plays though on the Podger Music Network, yeah, got to get that up a little

31
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
bit.

32
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Hey, everybody.

33
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
How you doing?

34
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
It's the Daily Source Code.

35
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:19,880
It's episode number 601 still kind of wallowing in the, in the backwash of all the

36
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,320
goodness surrounding episode number 600, it can't really help because it's still a crap

37
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
day today.

38
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,640
Again, raining, it's windy, it'll be nice from time to time.

39
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,320
I mean, that means the sun will basically break through a little bit, but it's going

40
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,640
to stay generally overcast.

41
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,920
This is, of course, for the G-Town region, that would be the affluent suburb of

42
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,720
Surrey known as Gilford.

43
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,240
Now even though it's kind of dark and gloomy, it's been this way for what Friday's

44
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Saturday's Sunday.

45
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,480
So it's like four or five days now, there's just been crap weather.

46
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,720
It is even kicked in some natural cycles on the Lady Patricia, because what she does when

47
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,480
the weather is, it's crap and kind of dank and dark and, you know, and particularly

48
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,760
when, well, in the winter, she does all the time, but, you know, when we were having such

49
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,200
beautiful weather now to have this crop up on us, she's resorted to making her famous

50
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
soup.

51
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,560
Listeners of the Charlie have been around for a couple of years, we'll know that this

52
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,640
is the soup that cures all.

53
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,440
It has a little bit of ginger in it and all kinds of other goodness.

54
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
And what she does is she makes it at night.

55
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
I said, this is so old fashioned.

56
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,600
She makes it at night on the aga, of course.

57
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,880
And then when it's all steamed and brewed and there it has to sit overnight and she puts

58
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,680
it near the window where, you know, it can cool down, yet it doesn't get too cold, but

59
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,280
you also don't want the weather all of a sudden, striking into it and ruining it all.

60
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,000
And so the this morning, when I, when I woke up, I could, I could just smell a little

61
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
bit of it.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,800
She's just heated it up now for, I guess, what should be lunch?

63
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,120
It's already five to two on behind as usual.

64
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,680
And you can smell it throughout the whole house.

65
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,640
It's really nice chicken vegetables, just that hint of ginger, oh, man, my life is so

66
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
good.

67
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,480
All right, uh, notice of on today, I'm working on a couple of leads.

68
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,920
I did talk to a candyman, Luke over at Nokia about yesterday's question about the, uh,

69
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
exploding, uh, Nokia battery.

70
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,880
And so I've passed on contact information.

71
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,400
We're going to keep it kind of low key.

72
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,920
But there is a guy, a dedicated guy at Nokia, apparently, who looks at all this shit.

73
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,560
And even there, the belief is like, way, it can't be in a, it can't be in a original

74
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Nokia battery.

75
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
It doesn't happen with ours.

76
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,120
So, um, trying to set it up, so we investigate what's going on, because, you know, one

77
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,840
is all it takes.

78
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,040
What's somehow I, I think, I think there may be some bogus parts involved in play here,

79
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,640
not entirely sure, uh, crap hold on, pilot era as usual.

80
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,680
Hey, man, you won't go shoot some pool?

81
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
I can't, man.

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,400
I gotta go work on my podcast.

83
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
You know what?

84
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
How's that?

85
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,960
I thought you dropped out of school.

86
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,560
Yeah, I did, but I went to this podcast and they hooked me up with all the fact knowledge.

87
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
And Orole, now I can do it.

88
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,080
Wow, that's so really cool, man.

89
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,840
Hey, you think I could do something like that?

90
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,200
Maybe there's another podcast coming up on May 19th.

91
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,600
Go to www.podcampzanandtonio.org and check it out.

92
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,200
Don't let opportunity pass you by.

93
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Learn the secrets of the pros atpodcampzanandtonio, remember that's May 19th, podcastanandtonio.org.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,560
Yeah, I tried to play the Spanish version of the promo for some reason it was gone

95
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
or it wouldn't load.

96
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,600
I was like, that would be so cool to have a Spanish podcast promo running, but unfortunately

97
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
couldn't make it work.

98
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,840
There's a lot of stuff going on with these podcasts.

99
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,040
It's, uh, it's a very interesting phenomenon.

100
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,640
Of course, we know the podcast camp in New York, familiar with that one.

101
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,880
There was, oh, there was a huge discussion going on in the UK about two different podcasts.

102
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,720
And so there's a podcast, uh, I guess UK.

103
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,800
And then there was, and which is going to be held, and I think, um, either Manchester

104
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
or Birmingham.

105
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
I don't think that's been short up yet.

106
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,800
And then there was another podcast being organized, I think, uh, in Buckingham

107
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Sure.

108
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,760
So podcast bucks.

109
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,400
And there was this whole discussion about, you know, you shouldn't have two podcasts.

110
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,840
But the, I don't know if they were scheduled for the same time or around the same

111
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,960
time or whatever it was and it was, the whole discussion felt so perpendicular to the

112
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,760
entire idea of a podcast that anyone can set this up and, you know, the rules are pretty

113
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,000
much obvious.

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,400
And, uh, you know, it's, uh, it's supposed to be an uncomference, which is very difficult

115
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
to organize.

116
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,360
I might point out or very not to organize, but to make run smoothly because you still

117
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,080
want to try and not have the speaker audience, uh, type relationship where basically

118
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,200
the speakers are the audience and the audience are the speakers.

119
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,560
And, and to me, it's, it felt like, wow, you know, so there's two different podcasts.

120
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,400
And, uh, one is basically claiming superiority over the other.

121
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
I don't know.

122
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
It was just weird.

123
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,080
I had nothing to do with the spirit of podcasts and I can't, we all just get along.

124
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,680
But so anyway, this podcast that's coming up in the UK, uh, the interesting, uh, to see

125
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,160
if it's Birmingham or Manchester, either one is a fine flying destination, I, I might

126
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,880
have, you know.

127
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,320
And maybe maybe Thursday, I'll be flying myself.

128
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,240
We'll cut a Charlie, uh, in the air.

129
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,920
Uh, today would have been possible, but we commend William is, uh, he's flying somewhere

130
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,840
else today tomorrow going into the, uh, in the city.

131
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:23,320
You've got a couple of sales calls to do with the sales we easled Daniel at the UK Crash

132
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,560
pad office.

133
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,040
And then in the evening dinner with super agent Keith, look him up, super agent Keith

134
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
Bishop.

135
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,600
That guy's got something going on, uh, lady Patricia and I will be entertaining him in some

136
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,360
swanky restaurant and so, uh, you know, it's, uh, you remember the hit tests?

137
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
I'm sure you do.

138
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,320
Yon Polad who, by the way, uh, did today's opening for the show, appreciate it,

139
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Yon.

140
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,000
Uh, he used to put together the, uh, the hit test.

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,120
And I'm, I'm really working around regulations and fair use and all kinds of, you know,

142
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,280
different, uh, different policies because I'd love to be doing the hit test again.

143
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,520
And of course, when I stopped doing the hit test, there were many, many voices saying,

144
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,440
well, why don't you do a, a pot-safe music hit test, which is like ridiculous, because

145
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,720
you need some history, you know, you need to hear a song and have to think, oh, yeah,

146
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,920
that was, uh, the summer of 69 or, you know, the summer of whatever it was that

147
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,640
a really trigger a memory and emotions, not just a recognition factor.

148
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,400
Now with 600 episodes under my belt and several years of doing this, uh, including several

149
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,640
years of the pot-safe music network, how long has that thing been around?

150
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,080
Now two years, two and a half, maybe even longer, three years, perhaps?

151
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,760
Um, I think it's time to do that.

152
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,680
And of course, there's always someone out there who's put something together.

153
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:42,720
Hey, Adam, this is Maurice's on deck from the Sunday Sundana, and I've got a new contest

154
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
for you.

155
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
All right.

156
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,080
It's called the pot-safe sack and it's really simple.

157
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,840
Now play just the second three pot-safe songs, okay, and it's up to you to get the name

158
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
of the artist and the song.

159
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
All right, everyone in the play.

160
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
The simple, let's hit test.

161
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Yeah.

162
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Then pot-safe.

163
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Yeah.

164
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
Are you ready?

165
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
I'm ready.

166
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Here's clip number one.

167
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Okay.

168
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
I know it.

169
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,320
That's brother love, uh, there she goes.

170
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
There she goes.

171
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,840
That's the most popular songs of the PMN, yeah.

172
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
So that wasn't easy.

173
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
It was again.

174
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,520
I figured that one would be in there.

175
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
This is what I mean.

176
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
How many pot-safe hits do you roll?

177
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
All right.

178
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
On to the next one.

179
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Okay.

180
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Number two.

181
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
Here it comes.

182
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
All right.

183
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,520
I know those hooks from a mile away.

184
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,520
I might need a jingle for this one.

185
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,520
So let's listen to this once again.

186
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
Uh, not on the radio.

187
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,520
Jeff Smith.

188
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
And the last one.

189
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
Okay.

190
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Here's clip number three.

191
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Dude, you make this too easy.

192
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Uh, the best pot-safe artist to many of the listeners.

193
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
So got any idea?

194
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,520
Yes.

195
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Here it is for the last time.

196
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
I think I know it.

197
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Drive away.

198
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
Matthew Eagle.

199
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
On to the answers.

200
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,520
The first clip was this one.

201
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Ooh.

202
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,520
And of course, it was brother love with goal she village.

203
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Yeah.

204
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
The huge hit on the pot-safe music network.

205
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
God, that was right.

206
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Yeah.

207
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Yeah.

208
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Yeah.

209
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Yeah.

210
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Yeah.

211
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
Yeah.

212
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
All right.

213
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
clip number two was this one.

214
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,520
What was it?

215
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,520
The King of the King right for the VSC.

216
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Mr. Jeff Smith.

217
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Not on the radio.

218
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
The York San Francisco.

219
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,520
The San York in an box.

220
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
You become somebody told me.

221
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
You got that one right?

222
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Probably.

223
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,520
And the last pot-safe sack was this one.

224
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:56,520
And of course, Mr. Matthew Eagle with my way.

225
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
So thanks Adam.

226
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,520
I hope you liked this first episode of Pot-safe second.

227
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,520

231
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
I appreciate it.

232
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
It's going to be hard though, man.

233
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
It's going to be hard to create.

234
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I mean, look, this was almost no challenge for me.

235
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,520
The whole point is it has to be kind of, you know, difficult.

236
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
I can just hear young pull-ups.

237
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,520
It's his butt-crack sweating right now as he's listening to all this going on.

238
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Mash up for the day, DJ Error,

239
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
over the confluence of giants.

240
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,520
See if you can detect the hits in this one for a sec.

241

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
I love this guy.

419
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
I love this guy.

420
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
I love this guy.

421
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
I love this guy.

422
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
I love this guy.

423
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
I love this guy.

424
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
I love this guy.

425
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,520
I love this guy.

426
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
I love this guy.

427
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:47,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

428
00:17:47,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

429
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,520
I always have to think of this, you know, I just can't help myself.

430
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,520
I do my business on the throne.

431
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:59,520
I'm a sitter, I'm a standard, I'm a left-right-hander.

432
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,520
It's nice to know I'm not alone.

433
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,520
So besides Steve Miller-Band, David Bowie, the Patentini Group,

434
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
but this is not American, Steve Lee Danes do it again,

435
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,520
and all that mashup from DJ Error, Error.

436
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,520
courtesy of mashuptown.com, official supplier of mashup,

437
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
to the Chacha, resurrected.

438
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,520
You know, the more I play this folder scruncher song,

439
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,520
the more links I get to a new...

440
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,520
I mean, I know everything about toilet paper dispensers,

441
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
colored toilet paper.

442
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,520
I mean, I just know a lot more about the world's bathroom habits

443
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
and I really should.

444
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,520
That's still that makes me a much richer man.

445
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
All right, so it's taking a long time,

446
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,520
and I think that Friday, we're finally going to launch.

447
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,520
It's just called this an unofficial dam announcement.

448
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,520
We've teamed up with E-Paul, who, of course, accredited

449
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,520
and leader in industry of measurement,

450
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,520
audience measurement, and particularly a surveyed test results.

451
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
We're going to be building the biggest,

452
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,520
all I just call it, the super panel of podcast listeners

453
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,520
and creators, starting with the United States.

454
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,520
And it's going to be good, because not only do you have the chance

455
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,520
of getting all kinds of cool stuff, but you help us suck less.

456
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Help us suck less.

457
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Help us suck less.

458
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
Help us suck less.

459
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,520
Help us suck less.

460
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Help us suck less.

461
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Help us suck less.

462
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Help us suck less.

463
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,520
Help us suck less.

464
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,520
www.thevotecast.com.

465
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,520
New episodes, every other Tuesday.

466
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Where people with different people

467
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,520
with different political views can have a conversation

468
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,520
and still walk away friends.

469
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
The Votecast.

470
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Nice.

471
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Okay.

472
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Quick update on Afghanistan.

473
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
My goodness, what have I gotten myself?

474
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
What has my wife gotten me into?

475
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,520
So you recall that because the Royal Dutch Marines

476
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
performed where they're on the Dancing with the Stars show

477
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
in the Netherlands week ago,

478
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,520
part of the deal was that she would have to bring her show to Afghanistan.

479
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,520
And not just to Afghanistan, but to three camps,

480
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
including Condahar, the International Camp,

481
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,520
where I believe the Dutch will just be providing the entertainment

482
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,520
for the entire camp that evening.

483
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,520
I have no idea.

484
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
I think there's thousands of people there.

485
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
So I'm not quite sure how it works.

486
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
I'm getting the information like,

487
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,520
oh, Matt, for God and how much show work that goes into this.

488
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
How big is your stage?

489
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Is one question.

490
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
That determines how many people we need to bring.

491
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
How many people can we bring?

492
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,520
And oh, by the way, you get free transportation.

493
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,520
You get free lodging and meals.

494
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
And you get free protection.

495
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,520
Everything else you got to take care of yourself.

496
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,520
So it's kind of hard when you want to bring along cute dancers.

497
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
They usually charge money for anything they do.

498
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
And rightfully so.

499
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,520
So basically, I'm going to have to sell some kind of TV stuff

500
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
to the Dutch market.

501
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,520
And you just to be able to pay for some of the expenses

502
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,520
like now sound system.

503
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
We have to bring that ourselves.

504
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
A lot that goes into it, but.

505
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
And this is another thing I'm investigating.

506
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
I do believe they've got all the pipe.

507
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
They've got all the telecommunications.

508
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,520
So we can do a lot of fun stuff podcast wise from there.

509
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
Talk about some savants.

510
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,520
So I'll keep you updated on that.

511
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,520
And oh, by the way, free Trinity has not gone away.

512
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
It has not been sidetracked.

513
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,520
You'll be hearing about that in the next.

514
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,520
I want to say next week, but I just have to be very careful.

515
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
Not saying these things.

516
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,520
We're coordinating everything now.

517
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,520
I have a new assistant who is a caller and executive assistant.

518
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,520
Carry who's in the UK office at the crash pad, which is much better for me

519
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
because during the waking hours.

520
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
And I mean, that's like until six in the afternoon,

521
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,520
even though I do all kinds of crap with San Francisco until 11 at night.

522
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
I'm much less sharp.

523
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,520
And I'm probably saying yes to things that I shouldn't.

524
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
Because I don't really know what the hell is going on with my schedule.

525
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,520
So she's starting to organize my life.

526
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
It's nice.

527
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
It really is.

528
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
You know, I guess we're chaotic.

529
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,520
I guess we're kind of a professional organization.

530
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,520
He just started up his 16th summer in New York City.

531
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,520
It is the guy from Central Park, that guitar, man.

532
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
Your governor, Miss.

533
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
David E. Polito.

534
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:55,520
In a world filled with cruelty and injustice.

535
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Ordinary people feel such strain and strife.

536
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,520
There are just too many rules.

537
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Men for common folk and fools.

538
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Not for those who want to live a simple life.

539
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,520
And there's a woman who has shown the kind of courage.

540
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,520
To be seen when she's not wearing underwear.

541
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,520
And when she's drunk all over town,

542
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,520
She stares the paparazzi down.

543
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,520
So to lock her up, just really isn't fair.

544
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Free Paris.

545
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,520
Free Paris.

546
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Oh come on and orange jumpsuit.

547
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Simply will not fit her right.

548
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,520
We can't stand to see her face in such a grand tacky place.

549
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:06,520
Won't you free our spoiled entitled social eye?

550
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:13,520
Now on YouTube, I see videos of people who are so angry.

551
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,520
About boring things like politics and poor.

552
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Some place that's called Iraq, but I can't find it on the map.

553
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,520
I think it's somewhere between St. Bart and Darfur.

554
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:38,520
But Americans like us can still get bothered.

555
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,520
The important things demand we stand and fight.

556
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,520
And I've got something here to say.

557
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Besides my gym is closed today.

558
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:56,520
And American Idol isn't on tonight.

559
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,520
Free Paris.

560
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,520
Free Paris.

561
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:09,520
When your parents are that wealthy laws are not meant to apply.

562
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,520
And when you have such scant appeal,

563
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,520
driving crunk is no big deal.

564
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Don't make her tell her darling,

565
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,520
take her mouth, go and buy everything.

566
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,520
Free Paris.

567
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,520
Free Paris.

568
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
Next, I've got a partner.

569
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,520
He didn't even have a TV show.

570
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,520
She's the patron saint, I guess.

571
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,520
A very shallow drunken mess.

572
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,520
So you got to let our Paris built in gold.

573
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,520
One of the true American art forms.

574
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
This type of music.

575
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
I love it.

576
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
David Bollito.

577
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
And free Paris.

578
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,520
Free Paris.

579
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
Hilton.

580
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
He has so many emails.

581
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
And he linked to the song.

582
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
And of course, it's on the Potset Music Network.

583
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,520
And he said, yeah, it'll probably have a lifespan of only two weeks.

584
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
But what the heck?

585
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
I'm like, I don't know, man.

586
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,520
She's going to be in the in the break for 45 days.

587
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,520
So we have at least six weeks.

588
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,520
And I think we need to look more of a we are the world vibe to it.

589
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
You know, the free Paris.

590
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,520
I think that would get some airplane.

591
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,520
Of course, there's a video to go with it as well.

592
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
You can find it.

593
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,520
I think you can get to it from I love the company.

594
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,520
I LTC dot pod.

595
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520

Yeah.

599
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,520
Crack me up dude.

600
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
All right.

601
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
Hope you don't feel cheated.

602
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,520
I'm going to cut it short right now because there's a lot going on.

603
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
And stuff I want to announce this week.

604
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
So I got to get cracking.

605
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,520
And.

606
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
This is tomorrow.

607
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,520
Let me think tomorrow is going to be a kind of a crazy busy day.

608
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,520
It's a said lady Patricia not going into town for dinner.

609
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,520
I'm going to be in town earlier probably for a couple of meetings.

610
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm not sure if we'll get I'm trying to get a couple of savants that all.

611
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,520
We'll record this evening and use them for tomorrow show.

612
