Delta Sierra Charlie 5 to 8.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,640
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,640
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,640
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,640
I'm suggesting kids that are great.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,640
Dear star, mood, apathetic.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
My life is spiraled like that word.

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
I couldn't get enough of mine to go to the bloodbed romance and suffocate me dry concert.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,640
It sucks because they play with my favorite songs.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Stop my heart because I love you and rip apart my soul.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Of course, stab your ribs, stab, stab, stab.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,640
It doesn't help that I couldn't get my hair to that flippy thing either.

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
It's like that guy from that band can do.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
Some days now.

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm an emo kid.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
I'm not informing as can be.

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,640
You've been not informing too if you look just like me.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I have painted my nails and make it on my face.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,640
I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my legs because I feel real deep.

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,640
When I'm dressing in drag, I call it freedom of expression.

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
What's this called me a bag?

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Because our dudes look like chicks.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Nerd chicks look like dykes because emo is one step below.

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Transvestite.

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Stop my breathing and slip my throat.

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,640
I must be emo.

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,640
I don't jump around when I go to shows.

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
I must be emo.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
I'm dark.

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,640
And sensitive with those of a steam.

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,640
The way I dress makes everyday feel like Halloween.

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,640
I have no real problems but I'd like to make believe.

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
I stole my sister's mask here and now I'm grounded for a week.

38
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,640
And writing poetry or my hobbies.

39
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
I can't get through a hollown heights up and without sobbing.

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Goes keep breaking up with me.

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
It's never any fun.

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
They say they already have a pussy.

43
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,640
They don't need another one.

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,640
Stop my breathing and slip my throat.

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
I must be emo.

46
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,640
I don't jump around when I go to shows.

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,640
I must be emo.

48
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Dying my hair and polish on my toes.

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
I must be emo.

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,640
I play guitar and write suicide notes.

51
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
I must be emo.

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,640
My life is just a black abyss.

53
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
You know, it's so dark.

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
And it's suffocating me.

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Craving a holl for me and tightening a strip.

56
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Tired of the pair of little sister's jeans.

57
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
Which is a great update for the lady.

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,640
When I get depressed, I cut my recent every direction.

59
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Hearing songs by getting dumped give me an erection.

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
I write in a live drill and where I think we're in blasts.

61
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,640
I tell my friends I bleed black and cry during blasts.

62
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,640
I'm just a bad, cheap imitation of God.

63
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,640
Digging me catcher in the right and watch me jack off.

64
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,640
I were skinned tight clothes while hating my life.

65
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,640
If I said I like girls, I'd only be half right.

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,640
I look like I'm dead and just like a homo.

67
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,640
I must be emo.

68
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
Screw Xbox.

69
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
I play old school Nintendo.

70
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
I must be emo.

71
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,640
I'd like to wine and hit my parental's.

72
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,640
I must be emo.

73
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,640
Me and my friends all look like clones.

74
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,640
I must be emo.

75
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
My parents don't get me now.

76
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,640
They think I'm gay just because they saw me kiss a guy.

77
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
Well, a couple guys.

78
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
But I mean, it's a 2000's.

79
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Can't two or four dudes make out with each other without being gay.

80
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,640
I mean, chicks dig that kind of thing anyways.

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
I don't know, Dari.

82
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,640
Sometimes I think you're the only one that gets me.

83
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
It's Adam and Andrew.

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
The emo kid.

85
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
Hey, everybody.

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Talk us.

87
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
How you doing?

88
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Welcome to the Daily Source Code episode 528 coming to you from Curri Condo.

89
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
I am crippled.

90
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
It's perfect.

91
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Quabar today is in full effect.

92
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,640
I got no connectivity at the condo.

93
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,640
Oh, man.

94
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,640
No connectivity at the other place, which we still haven't found the name for.

95
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Worked in on it.

96
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Yeah.

97
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Oh, I hate it.

98
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
I hate it.

99
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Apparently, what's been going on is Comcast, the incumbent.

100
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,640
And you know, I don't have a telephone line in here at all.

101
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
I have, I don't need a telephone line.

102
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
I got a cell phone.

103
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,640
I just all I needed was a cable modem, cable connection.

104
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Someone I arrived to yesterday.

105
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
Was it yesterday?

106
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,640
No, the day before yesterday, Wednesday.

107
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,640
I rolled into town and the minute I walked in, you know, I fired up the eye

108
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Mac.

109
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,640
I fired up my, uh, my Nokia to connect it to the network.

110
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,640
It connects to the Curri Condo network and no connectivity outside.

111
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Turn on the television.

112
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
No television.

113
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Well, that's a pretty big clue right there.

114
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,640
What's been happening is Comcast is now.

115
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
This is what they say.

116
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
I'm not quite sure what it means.

117
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,640
They've been changing quote provider.

118
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,640
I didn't know that Comcast had to deal with their own provider.

119
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,640
But the provider that, uh, I guess brings the lines into different buildings, including

120
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
the condo.

121
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,640
Three floors were out for a week apparently.

122
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,640
And so we had all kinds of people running around because yeah, without connectivity

123
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
at the condo, I might as well go to a hotel.

124
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
You know, it makes no sense for me to stay here.

125
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
It's really pissing me off.

126
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,640
So the, uh, Wednesday afternoon or Wednesday evening when I got back, it worked.

127
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Television worked.

128
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Everything was fantastic.

129
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,640
And then in the morning yesterday morning, uh, I had, you know, no connectivity.

130
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,640
And about, um, a third of the channels that I normally get on television are coming in.

131
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,640
So clearly, there's something wrong with a throughput in the building.

132
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,640
I guess it's just, I don't know, but it's really pissing me off.

133
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,640
You just forget how incredibly dependent you are on on some type of real connection.

134
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:15,640
And so I've been trying to pair up my vio, uh, through Bluetooth to my, uh, E61, uh, download stuff from the edge network.

135
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Man, that's, that's, I'm telling you, that, that really is football.

136
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Which, of course, stands for fucked up beyond our repair.

137
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Trying to make one of those connections.

138
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
No way.

139
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
I just can't figure it out.

140
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Then you've got to have all these logins and data.

141
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,640
And it's fucking seven o'clock in the morning.

142
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,640
So I'm having a wonderful day.

143
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
How about you guys?

144
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Really pissed off.

145
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
But at least it's weekend.

146
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:45,640
So, um, I guess we'll just get someone on the case and keep calling the help desk all day long and trying to get this shit squared away.

147
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Because I really, I will go to a hotel.

148
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,640
I can't stay here if I don't have a connection.

149
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Now there's all kinds of connections.

150
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,640
And you know, people are getting a little tight estimate.

151
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,640
And you know, I, I love to keep my wireless connections wide open.

152
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,640
I must be seeing at least 15 different networks from here.

153
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
And, uh, all of them are closed and locked up.

154
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
There's a couple that are open.

155
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:11,640
Now, one of them that I used to try or used to use when I just got into the condo before Comcast had delivered any type of connectivity.

156
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Ben Bo 7.

157
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,640
I think is, uh, is the network name.

158
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
It's gotten real flaky.

159
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,640
It's probably this construction that's going on outside, which by the way,

160
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:27,640
that building that they've been putting up next to the condo is now officially at least at least 50 feet taller than my building.

161
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,640
So it's blocking out some of my view now for the first time.

162
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Can you tell them having a really good day?

163
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Ah.

164
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:43,640
What's been interesting is that lots of people have been sending in suggestions for the new place in Guilford,

165
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,640
West Side of Gtown.

166
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Of course, I don't really want to call it the Curry condo anymore.

167
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Uh, or the Curry Cottage.

168
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
Because we already had one of those.

170
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,640
We come up with Camp Curry, Curry Compound.

171
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,640
We got Curry Casbah, kind of like that one.

172
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,640
The Curry Complex, and people are calling in with ideas.

173
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Hi Adam, it's Rowley from the Dark Compass podcast.

174
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,640
I'm just listening to the SCI-27.

175
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,640
I don't know fact on five to six you mentioned them as well.

176
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:20,640
The idea of your Adam Curry, Curry condo Curry Cottage.

177
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Well, that's a curry.

178
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,640
I don't know if it's not exactly British.

179
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,640
But thank you.

180
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:35,640
I just want to push that your wife and the same wife.

181
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Yeah, Curry Casa.

182
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Yeah.

183
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
I don't know.

184
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
If I had a place in Spain, it would be perfect.

185
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
It would be the Curry Casa, or the place in Portugal.

186
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
They would work most excellent.

187
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
But no.

188
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Uh, let's see.

189
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,640
By the way, it took me about 45 minutes to get these voicemails in.

190
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Here's what I did.

191
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,640
I downloaded them through the tablet.

192
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Uh, the internet tablet, the N800 through the GSM from the E61.

193
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Then transferred those via Bluetooth over to to the via.

194
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
So I could load them up.

195
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,640
And of course, I still had to transcode them from the GSM format.

196
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,640
Whatever that file format is that J2.com uses had to transcode them into MP3.

197
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,640
So it was a nice, you know, you're going to listen to all the freaking phone calls today,

198
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,640
because I spent so much time getting them.

199
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,640
I had them as party checking in from a rather grey, cold and miserable London.

200
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
There you go. That's life.

201
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Just quick question.

202
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Um, what happens to your parents on Twitter?

203
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
I was really looking forward to that.

204
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I appreciate an update.

205
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Check it.

206
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Yeah, that's a good one.

207
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Um, it kept getting messed up.

208
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
We were, there was a first I came back.

209
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
I was, uh, was it four weeks ago.

210
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,640
I came back on a Sunday, uh, which meant I would have had to stay up until midnight.

211
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Because I think they tapered three or four in the afternoon.

212
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,640
And then it was Christmas and there was new years.

213
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
And then I forgot a week.

214
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
And so here we are back again.

215
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,640
I have kind of a standing invitation to just call in.

216
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,640
So, uh, depending on what's happening this weekend.

217
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,640
Uh, we have a, there is a photo shoot going on at the office.

218
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
With one of our new, uh, new hosts.

219
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
I'm not going to tell you about it just yet.

220
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

221
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Since sale was a damn nice splendor on top.

222
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
So maybe Sunday afternoon I'll call into, I'll call in to Twitter.

223
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
James Newcastle.

224
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Uh, Adams antique a boat.

225
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,640
He feedback.

226
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
All right, like that.

227
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
The trip away.

228
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Adams antique a boat.

229
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,640
And maybe we should move away from the C.C.

230
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
It's just, I like saying, curry-

231
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Something, curry, condom.

232
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Creech, Creech lost in me bag, you know, that kind of stuff.

233
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,140
It just kind of feels good.

234
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,640
Hey everybody, it's Friday.

235
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,640
Let's make it work like a Friday and roll out some food bar tunes

236
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
from the archives of course.

237
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
I couldn't download anything new.

238
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Deck of Jones.

239
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,640
First date.

240
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
First date.

241
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Electricity.

242
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,640
When you walk in, you set my circuit tree.

243
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Back it up.

244
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,640
We've got to do it, we're people swearin' it out,

245
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
you always play it cool.

246
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,640
I think I know you, I'm gonna bet,

247
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
if you like super joke,

248
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,640
and don't get, get your quick fix,

249
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
in my car.

250
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,640
You got a sweet truth, then I'm your trippler boy.

251
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
And it goes on.

252
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

253
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,640
And I say hey, hey,

254
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
do you kiss for the first date?

255
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,640
Do you kiss for the first date?

256
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Cause I do, cause I do, cause I do, cause I do, cause I do, cause I do, cause I do, cause I do.

257
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
New York, down.

258
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,640
On the catwalk, I like to play it to spring.

259
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,640
You don't want to show, sway, pain you.

260
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Touching you.

261
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
And who's yourself?

262
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Don't be wrong, don't take it chance.

263
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
Give me your shot.

264
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,640
You think I'm bluffing?

265
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,640
I think I'm not, get on your hideeal.

266
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Give me your hideeal.

267
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,640
I got a question for your sweet ass.

268
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,640

And I say hey, hey,

270
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,640
do you kiss for the first date?

271
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Do you kiss for the first date?

272
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Do you kiss for the first date?

273
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,640
Do you kiss for the first date?

274
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Cause I do, do you do, what I do?

275
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,640
And with you, if you do, what you do, what I do?

276
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,640
Well, hello, baby, you look so hot tonight.

277
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Can I hold your hand?

278
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
What the heck?

279
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Now, this is what we're going to do in our date today.

280
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,640
We're going to do all the things all the couples like to do.

281
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
We're going to go to a movie.

282
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
We're going to have some dinner.

283
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Take a walk, look at the moonlight.

284
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,640
Anything you want, but baby, I got a question.

285
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,640
Do you kiss for the first date?

286
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,640
Let's do it off a first date.

287
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Hey!

288
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,640
What do you do, what the first date?

289
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Do you kiss for the first date?

290
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,640
If I do, I do, cause I do, cause I do.

291
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
Cause I do, cause I do, cause I do.

292
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,240
Thank you Jones you can find them on the pod save music network. You can go to

293
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,040
podshow.com slash music and just do a search on Danko Jones. We got a couple of

294
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,080
awesome new artists on the pod save music network, which of course I was thinking about

295
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,480
playing for you on this wonderful Friday afternoon where the sun is shining in northern

296
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:21,880
California. It is beautiful. It's very cold though. Apparently back home or back on the island

297
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,680
from member the united kingdom. It is the new Caribbean with global warming. We've had

298
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,720
exactly the opposite. It's been peace soup. It's been 80 mile an hour winds, trees falling

299
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,120
down. The girls give me reports through email. We second still receive that.

300
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,040
The hell was I going to say? Anyway, so a lot of people sent in email

301
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,120
and said, why didn't you come in on the weekend? Why did you come to San Francisco

302
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,880
midweek? That's because we had our presentation of our 2007 plan

303
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,560
for our board of directors, which I love doing these meetings. This is so much fun because

304
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:04,360
these are smart people. Very smart. And what I get to do in the meetings, I get to do lots of

305
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,280
demos. I love doing the demos. Yesterday I showed two things I showed podshow TV and you're going to

306
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:18,760
love this. This is our interface for podshow plus the runs on IPTV or media center.

307
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,160
So when that's done and when it's available, you literally will be able to load up podshow

308
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:33,720
into your television. Hence the name podshow TV. I think it's so amazing to play around with this

309
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,600
stuff because we've totally come up with a different interface than what people are using,

310
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:44,920
or typically using for media center or for IPTV. IPTV isn't really rolled out yet anywhere,

311
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:52,520
but BT British telecom is rolling it out this year. Of course, that's the target.

312
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,760
And there's lots of stuff to do still, but man, I love showing that because all of a sudden,

313
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,800
just browsing through people's profile and seeing what they're subscribed to,

314
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,720
what they're listening to, what they're watching. That becomes fun just all by itself.

315
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,080
When you're doing with remote control, there's something awesome about it. And of course,

316
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,480
we showed a lot of programming. We've got a brand new Marie Claire episode out,

317
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,880
which is a one up yesterday, the mast head. You can find it at MarieClaire.podshow.com.

318
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,000
What else went up? brand new in the attic? Let me play the intro from, I know that I played the

319
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,120
shit. I hope I have it. Did I delete that already? Oh, that would suck.

320
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,280
Hold on, I have to plug something in and don't I see if I can get this running through the mixer,

321
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:46,120
hold on. This is the show with the Rachel Fuller and her boyfriend. Oh, a guy named Pete

322
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,720
Townsend. You might have heard of him before. Okay. I wasn't quite set up for this, so just give me

323
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,560
a moment while I open it. I got a just all kinds of volume controls. I want you to hear the opening

324
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:05,800
of the show. It's episode. What does I think? It's episode number eight. What is it here? Here it is.

325
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,960
Okay. Now with a little bit of luck, it should actually play. Let's see if it works. Hold on.

326
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,480
Yeah. Hi, this is Rachel Fuller from in the attic with my special guest. I'm Pete Townsend of

327
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:24,440
the hoop. And in the attic. In the attic on every show. Anyway, you are watching podshow.com

328
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,640
and you are about to watch episode eight of in the attic on the road in Europe. And in this episode,

329
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,960
it features the cokes that lovely boys. Yeah, very well. Some mother them, they're so

330
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,160
young and lovely. And it's like spotty herb. They're very, very sweet. And they played a song called

331
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,800
Ula. And this was at the paleo festival in Switzerland earlier on this year. And we also have a

332
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,760
track from you from the new album. And I'm not going to tell you what it is. You're going to have to watch it.

333
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,640
Yeah, it's from the new album in this one. It's me doing an acoustic version, extended version

334
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,040
of a certain track. Of a certain track. And I'll say your brother comes on and play something. Simon,

335
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,040
my brother does he? Oh, good. That's good. I was here. You're like this show. It's a good show.

336
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,960
Here it comes. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it. Welcome to podshow.

337
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:14,120
Don't come. Ah, that's the money shop, man. I love it. You're going to like this show.

338
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,800
It's another fantastic one from the in the attic folks. Got another show that we're launching.

339
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,680
And we're doing it in video, even though it highlights a video and audio. We've got a brand new

340
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,600
host in the UK. Her name is Josephine Lawrence. And she's doing a show specifically for the UK,

341
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,480
but US guys, in girls, you might enjoy it too. Check it out. Oh, you can't see it, Canyon. Well,

342
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:48,600
just listen along. Hi there, guys and girls. Welcome to podfines. My name is Josephine Lawrence.

343
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,000
And today I'm going to be reviewing a sum of the best podcasters. Josephine. Josephine Lawrence

344
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,680
doing podfinder UK, podfinderuk.podshow.com. So I was showing all of this stuff through a

345
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,040
cast blaster video. And I didn't tell him about it. And I had a cast. When you see this thing,

346
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,080
it's in beta now. You're going to shit yourself. It is perfect for people who just want to

347
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,960
upload stuff. It is perfect for people who just upload a video. Don't do anything. There's uploaded.

348
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,880
It's perfect if you want to send something to a friend, a clip and want to add a little intro

349
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,080
through your webcam. Or if you want to produce a show, it's exactly the same theory as cast blaster

350
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,920
audio. So all they saw really was what like 12 different small windows. Every single time I

351
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,600
played a clip, it would show up in the big, what we'd call the program window. And down the right

352
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,520
hand corner off the side, there was a little window, which was my built-in camera on the via. When I kind

353
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,680
of had the lid position, so you didn't see a lot of movement, so it didn't distract, so people weren't

354
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:53,080
really seeing it. So when it came time to talk about cast blaster video, I'm tilted the lid and

355
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,760
I said, and I threw my, my built-in camera actual. And then in the meeting, I plugged in a second

356
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,480
USB cam just to off the shelf thing. And I pointed it at the board, who were on the other side of

357
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,600
the table. And I switched back and forth and they were like, wow, and I said, yeah, and check this out.

358
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,400
And plugged in a third one. So we had a three camera shoot all of a sudden running from my laptop.

359
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:22,920
And then I recorded a little bit. And it was so cool to do video shows this way. I think it's going to,

360
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:29,480
I think the people who are really like this will be vloggers as well. It's a fantastic vlogging tool.

361
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,400
Now, we're doing something interesting. Cast blaster mic, and I've been talking for quite a while

362
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,840
about video and video on the web and how, man, for 20 years, everything's been completely

363
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:46,920
fucked up. Thanks to Apple and Windows, fighting each other, quick time versus Windows media.

364
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,800
So, you know, if you ever wonder why an MP4 file will play on your iPod, but won't play on

365
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,960
something else, like Windows media player or vice versa, you can have an MP4, which will play

366
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,720
fine on Windows media player, but not on your iPod or in quick time. It's because

367
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,720
MP4 is just kind of like a container. It's just, it's like a box that you put the quick time video in.

368
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,360
So it's, none of that shit's compatible. And of course, if you look at the real success of

369
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,840
video on the web, it's flash flashes work and just about everywhere. What is the problem with this?

370
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,600
What is the problem with flash? This is what we went through here. Some of our thinking.

371
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,840
The problem with flash, if you upload to YouTube or Google video or pod show at this moment in

372
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,880
time, you know, we've got our viral video stuff. You can upload your videos. Actually, they have

373
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,200
the the share codes in the now too. So they truly are viral, not just flash videos.

374
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:45,240
Excuse me, Mr. Petita. The problem is you upload something. The quality turns to shit. It takes

375
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,280
a long time, sometimes depending on how many people are uploading stuff. And doesn't matter

376
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,200
what service you're using, whether using pod show or Google or YouTube or Reber, whoever it takes

377
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:01,720
some time for the video to be transported into flash. It's painful. So Mike and I came up

378
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,800
with a pretty evil plan, I think. And the idea is to hook up cast blaster video to the

379
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,560
PDN, the pod show pod cast delivery network, the same way the audio version works. So it's one

380
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:21,320
click publishing essentially, but to do the transcoding locally. So you'll be able to output

381
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,960
different formats, including flash. So we're setting it up. So you can have top notch top quality

382
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:36,200
fantastic flash videos that you can then with one click upload to pod show and then MP4 will be

383
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,600
put into an iPod compatible MP4, I'd have to say, we'll be put into into the feed. I mean,

384
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,320
we can go anywhere with this. Since this thing can literally shoot out anything out of the back

385
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,640
end of its ass, any format. We could have, you know, you can have four different versions,

386
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,480
all with one click of the button. So I'm very excited about that. Of course, you have to have

387
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:01,240
connectivity in order to actually use it. But the awesome thing about it is it will eat anything.

388
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:09,960
So you can throw in a Windows media file, an FLV, a quick time movie, an MP4, anything you want,

389
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,960
it will take and it will play. So all that transcoding and all of those formats and all that

390
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,600
shit is taking care of right before you're very eyes. And on the back end, you can just produce

391
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,040
one file that has awesome quality. And you can, yeah, as I said, you can use it as a production tool.

392
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,600
And in fact, Father Roderick, I saw was using it a very interesting way, using little

393
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:35,640
pre-packaged bits. And he was basically linking those together by switching back to his webcam.

394
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,600
You got to see this thing. I don't know if you can still sign up for the beta.

395
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,480
But if you, if you have a chance, go to castblastard.com. You will not be disappointed. I promise you.

396
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,000
All right. It is time to get out of here for food bar because I got to go to the office and upload

397
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,400
the show. And hopefully, we'll have more new music to play and more comments and promos on Monday

398
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,760
as connectivity is restored to the Curry Condo. Leave in you with the bitties. He's a hell of a boy.

399
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:28,760
Well, his song is true, but his head keeps getting in the way.

400
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,400
Now it's not like he's got a nasty disposition.

401
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Once to keep you locked up tight and knocked upright, barefoot in the kitchen.

402
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:03,000
He's a hell of a boy. Only, only half of a man.

403
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:25,640
No, it's not like the boys about it. Born on the wrong side of town, under the wrong wall, on the wrong day.

404
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:36,280
He's a hell of a boy. Only, only half of a man.

405
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,920
Just what do you think you will get every person's thinking? This is the best you can do.

406
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:58,680
Say no to your life girl. I'll be fine. You know it. Your life's going to say no to you.

407
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:25,800
Easy call, easy call, life's too short to live. So, no, it's not like it's more than you can say

408
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:34,040
to have that pretty boy sitting next to you kissing you, holding your hand.

409
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:45,000
He's a hell of a boy. But only, only half of a man.

410
00:26:45,640 --> 00:27:01,240
I like it, I like it, I like it, he's a hell of a boy. But only, only half of a man.

411
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,560
The city is British. He's a hell of a boy. You could find him on the pod save music network

412
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,920
and regularly here on the daily source code. Before I go, one more thing I wanted to play for

413
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:21,080
another new episode of a show going up called Who's on it? O.J. Borge, host that show,

414
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:28,280
you can find it at Who's on it.podshow.com. We got a whole great series of shows coming up.

415
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:34,520
Our episode is coming up for that show. We've got dirty sand chessal beyond Rachel and Pete. I think

416
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,480
are going to be on and they had the shakes on. Now, the shakes, as you know, debut their new

417
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,080
single. I want a better life to the pod save music network before radio, before the albums coming out.

418
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,600
This is the second, oh, this is the second one they're doing off the album.

419
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,960
I know, of course, Liberty Jones we all know, but now they came out with

420
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,120
I want a better life. And these guys, they know how to use our network. So they've got their

421
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,880
songs up on the pod save music network. They get tons of pod play. They're using our uploader

422
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,160
to upload their videos and live performances. You can find them because they're doing their own

423
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,840
show at the shakes dot pod show dot com. The shakes dot pod show dot com. And they're also

424
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,960
guests on the, on the upcoming episode of Who's on it, which I think might go up this weekend or

425
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:24,440
today, even. And they did something really cool. We had them come in and no, they were chatting away

426
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,320
with OJ and OJ pulled out these toy instruments, like a little toy guitar, a toy keyboard

427
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,280
and a toy drum kit. And they were game for it. And they played a version of I want to better

428
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,920
life, which I'll play a little bit for you here on a second. They've got a sign on the drum kit.

429
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:55,480
All right. And I want to better all the learnings, but in these small worlds, I'm my

430
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:06,040
living life, I want to better. I want to be your man. All right, you should go check out

431
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,800
who's on a dot pod show dot com for more about that. All right, I got to get out of here. I'm going to

432
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:16,920
go to the office. We got a lot of stuff going on today. Actually, we're doing something for another company.

433
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,480
I'm doing a video thing. Guess what company that's for? If you want a great deal in domain

434
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,200
name, check out GoDaddy dot com. Use check out code dsc3 for a fantastic deal. You know,

435
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,880
all about splendor. Of course, they don't have to promote the stomp to stomp the art anymore.

436
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,080
So they're in one movie. We did our job exactly what you expected. I told you it would work.

437
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:50,280
It's working. I'm so confused here by everything that's, uh, this is the one. Yeah, that's the one.

438
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:56,840
Okay. Hey, everybody. Adam and pod show dot com and a daily source code dot com. I'll

439
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,240
get the show notes up there. And if you, uh, if you have any connectivity for me, just send it my

440
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,480
way, please have yourself a great weekend, everybody. I'll talk to you on Monday once again from

441
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,960
Northern California at the Curry condo. Bye bye. Another pod show podcast. Stick it in your ear.

442
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,360
The best in the brightest served up daily by the sharpest minds and content delivery.

443
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,040
