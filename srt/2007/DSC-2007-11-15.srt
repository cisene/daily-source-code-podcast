I like to think of something

260
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I like to think of

261
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Something

262
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I like to think of something

263
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I like to think of something

264
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I like to think

265
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But I watch someone

266
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I like to think about things

267
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I like to think about something

268
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I like to think of something

269
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Everything looks like this

270
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It looks like this

271
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What does it look like

272
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes, people come up with and

273
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The first thing they came up with

274
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's not like it has it is too mad

275
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not like someone

276
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It has some kind

277
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So I don't realize that

278
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That has become my

279
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
wonderful

280
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,800
I've jimmed it so that I can use the internal mic. Now, of course, if I had another

281
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,920
three and a half inch to three and a half inch cable, then I could have used my proper microphone

282
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,720
although this doesn't sound too horrible. I mean, how sinky my friends it is it's really weird. I've no idea.

283
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,240
My body is completely confused

284
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,480
because only a few days ago I was on San Francisco time that's eight hours different from London,

285
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,760
flew to London. So, you know, kind of made the change over there. And this morning, after a lot of

286
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,800
crap at the airport, I finally got on a flight to Helsinki. The flight is only two and a half hours,

287
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:28,800
but you gain two hours in daytime, in hours. It's basically, it's two hours ahead of London,

288
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:36,160
so 10 hours ahead of San Francisco. Right now it is my body is saying it's 12, 23 in the evening,

289
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,440
which UK time would be about right, about time to go to bed. In fact, I just spoke to the lady

290
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,160
Patricia and bit her idea for the evening. She was a retiring, but here, of course, it's almost

291
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,200
two thirty in the morning and it's not like I get an extra two hours to sleep tomorrow because we've

292
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,120
got a number of meetings throughout the day. I'm definitely going to sleep on the plane ride,

293
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,240
ho, that's for sure. Of course, we're up here meeting with one of the few companies that

294
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,800
that everybody knows, a worldwide, which is a fine finish company called Nokia,

295
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,800
and they make all kinds of cool shit. Like, well, you might have seen a cell phone or two from them.

296
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,520
And of course, I'm a big fan of the 800 and they have a new device. I think we're just shipping

297
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,600
this week, the N-810, which is their brand new web tablet, which hopefully I'll get a chance to play

298
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:34,720
with tomorrow. Lots of people I've heard said it's pretty awesome. So I'm in a really depressing hotel

299
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,480
to give you an idea. I'm overlooking a shipyard that's building a cruise ship,

300
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,000
which is in the harbour. They've like three harbors in Helsinki, and I'm on the

301
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,320
southwestern side, and I walked into the hotel lobby and there was like a junior soccer team for

302
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,920
England, actually, and they were checking in. So it's kind of like, yeah, I'd say it's on the

303
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:08,320
level of holiday in something like that. I've got a nice little couple of espresso here,

304
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:15,280
a nice espresso machine. They've got here in the room, and so it's going to be kind of a short show

305
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,800
if you don't mind. Just play a couple of things, got some music, sure my brain will reset itself,

306
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,800
and I can tell you some stories about the past couple of days, because of course this is the

307
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,960
delayed source code instead of the daily source code, and some calls coming in on the voicemail lines,

308
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,200
it's our Savant of all things nuclear, a topic that animates raw atoms, your atomic Savant.

309
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,680
Yeah. I noticed yesterday that Al Gore has joined cleaner Perkins, your favorite

310
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,960
venture capital firm, was wondering if you do me a favor, if you ever get to meet the man,

311
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:58,000
can you ask him why he is reluctant to talk about atomic energy as a weapon in the fight against

312
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,280
global warming? That's a good question. That's a good question at topic, Rod.

313
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,240
And I do have a feeling that I may be meeting him soon. There's talk going on, you know?

314
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,360
It was a big supporter of the initial development of the technology.

315
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,400
Al Jr. made a whole movie about the dangers of global warming and some actions that can be

316
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,200
done to prevent it from harming the planet. The only time he ever alluded to nuclear was when he

317
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,240
mentioned some of the information we have about the effects in the Arctic came from visits to the

318
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,280
region made by nuclear submarines. I know you're a big fan of atomic technology, and also a man

319
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,320
who is interested in starting challenging conversations. Uh-huh. It would be great if you could

320
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,360
get that discussion rolling with Mr. Gore. By the way, do you know when you're good red pill

321
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,040
pushers? I think I'm hitting my supply too hard. They seem to be getting harder and hard to find

322
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:03,440
in our blue pill dominated society. Yeah, I'll thank you. Especially because I'm doing such a fine job

323
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:11,120
of, uh, man, what is going on? This is really not working for me. Let me see, I'm just going to message

324
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,720
or was that still atomic rods, uh, it's just complicated. Hold on. See, now when I want to switch

325
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,800
applications, my thing, hold on, crap. When I want to swap applications, if I do applekey tab,

326
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:31,360
my hand actually covers the microphone because it's in the left speaker back. Oh, I know this guy

327
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:43,840
can help. I'm extra. I'm extra. I'm extra. I'm extra. I'm extra. I'm extra. I'm extra.

328
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,360
I'm extra. Hiya, Adam, chicken te comasara carry. Here is your eucorrespondent

329
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:58,560
CSV. So Frank of Ratini is an eucormissioner who looks very similar to Stephen Colbert, and

330
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:06,320
he has some ideas. Some of these ideas are not so good, but some are cool with things. And

331
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:15,360
example of such good idea is blue card. Just imagine this. Hello stranger. Are you talented?

332
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:24,480
Are you skilled? European Union needs you. Come over to us the very cradle of Western civilization

333
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:32,320
and get blue card that will give you unlimited stay and work payments. Green card was yesterday,

334
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:41,040
but now when US dollar is worth just 15 years since, European Union offers much better future for

335
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:50,320
you and your family. So yes, European Union is launching blue card for talented and skilled

336
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:56,400
immigrants from Asia, Africa, and South America, and it is blue because blue is color of

337
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:08,000
you flag and symbolizes peace. So fuck you Adam carry. You. You. Thanks CSV. It is pretty interesting.

338
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,600
Finally, a European version of a green card called a blue card. Interesting how that clear

339
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,120
card that I talked about the other day. It that you can bypass, you get your special security line

340
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,920
from the TSA. Interesting. That is also blue. I wonder if one has anything to do with the other.

341
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,800
Big scandal going on in the United Kingdom by the way, by the immigration or speaking of immigration.

342
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,040
You know what I'm hearing a delay in my headphones now. This really sucks ass.

343
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,480
I just need to bring a mixer with me. A battery operated mixer. I need something. This is not working

344
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:52,480
out for me. The big scandal in the UK. The government hires lots of private security firms.

345
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,640
Their job is to provide security. A lot of government security functions that are necessary

346
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:06,080
are performed by employees of these private security firms and turns out that the government or

347
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,760
a department of the government. I guess it is homeland. The department of

348
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,600
homeland department is just a home department. Something like that. Among all of these companies,

349
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,960
they have tons of them. Approximately 5,000 of these employees are working in the United Kingdom

350
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,840
illegally. One of them is actually tasked with standing guard at the facility where the Prime

351
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,800
Minister's car is housed. You can imagine what a huge security risk that is. It's just

352
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:47,360
going crazy. In fact, really interesting. This is a big deal. I don't know if it's just coincidence,

353
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,000
but all of a sudden now there's bird flu and that's dominating the headlines and the bird flu.

354
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,600
It's only the bird flu that kills birds, not people. Of course, there's always the fear that

355
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:06,080
that bird flu will migrate and mutate, I should say, and then spark over to human beings. Then

356
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,960
outkilling all the Christmas turkeys. So we'll have no turkey for Christmas. That completely dominates

357
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,640
the news. What the real news is is kind of being drowned out. And I think it's incredibly

358
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,200
interesting to see how they're going to handle this. I'm just going to run through a couple more

359
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,560
comments because the sound is really freaking me out. With love from the Buckeye Drive Time podcast

360
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
and the tone ranger.

361
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,200
This pops around on my head for a while now. You move to Holland when you were seven years old.

362
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,360
First question. When the Dutch hear you speak in Dutch. Do they think you have an

363
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,120
accent or do you speak just flawless? Perfect. You know, total Dutch. Do they think you have an American

364
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,120
accent? That's a good question. You should actually ask the lady Patricia. I think,

365
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,720
well, with anything, if you've been away, if you've been out of the country and if you haven't

366
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,800
been speaking the language continuously, well, you know, obviously, you're going to, you know,

367
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,200
you're the, I'm sure I have a little bit of an English accent here and there. There's obviously

368
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,120
some American that kind of slips through. But if I've been in the Netherlands for a week or two,

369
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,440
yeah, I think I speak Dutch just about undetectably. So I can't even speak English with the

370
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,040
fuck am I doing it? And what's the other question? I don't even circumvent a member. Yeah,

371
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,760
meaning there. There you go. That was a simple question. That was white. Oh, yeah.

372
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,720
The other question was, when you go to some of the other sort of country neary, I don't know,

373
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,720
it's been left or Sweden. Are there similarities to the language? Do you all must understand

374
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,280
or even determine? Yeah. They're like, we're just similar enough to Dutch that you could actually

375
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,080
kind of make out what they're saying. Yeah. If you're in there, kind of like other languages,

376
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,720
like, you know, which we've mentioned, Spanish or something sometimes. British, British and Italian.

377
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,960
Definitely. Kind of pick up. Yeah. Just curious. Use it if you want.

378
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,400
Yes, you have a query. Thank you. Thank you. Well, interesting. You used to say that walking through

379
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:37,200
the hotel lobby here in Helsinki. It's really freaky because I keep thinking, I hear a language

380
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,640
that I understand, but I don't quite understand. I have to understand that the Dutch is very similar

381
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,240
to some Scandinavian languages. If you really listen, in fact, I'm pretty good at understanding

382
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,640
someone's speaking in Swedish. It kind of sounds like someone's speaking Dutch is really drunk.

383
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,440
In fact, the Dutch, as far as I'm concerned, are back up Scandinadians, you know,

384
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,640
if we need more Scandinavians, we can always get them from Holland. So yeah, there's a lot of

385
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:10,160
similarities there. Finnish, very difficult, not quite the same as Swedish. And of course, German

386
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,920
sounds very much like Dutch. In fact, it's extremely similar. And, you know, there's what we would

387
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,480
say, a Yiddish South African is also very similar or South African such as say. So yeah,

388
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,440
there's plenty of similarities.

389
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,840
Featuring an inspiring main interpretation of the Richie Havens Classic, Motherland's Child.

390
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,320

The wonderful pipes of Brian Know Everybody. Brian clearly doesn't have enough work.

394
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,360
We've got to give him more to do. One last phone call, an old buddy of mine, check it in. This is

395
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,880
I would say that Doug Moni was the first guy to pick up on what I was doing,

396
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:49,760
pre pre the word podcasting. And he published a pretty, I think, a pretty important article

397
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,560
for the company he's working for at the time. And he's moved around. He's a journalist. I think

398
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:02,640
he's a really good one. We go way back to the mtv.com days and low and behold ladies and gentlemen,

399
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,520
a savont from my past Doug Moni. Adam Doug Moni, editor in Sheep of Bond Magazine,

400
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:16,800
checking in. I just wanted to say hi. I haven't talked with you in ages. I have to confess. I

401
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,480
haven't listened to the DSC in ages. Oh father, please forgive me for that sin.

402
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,760
But I wanted to tell you I was at a party a couple weeks ago in Boston. And I heard a familiar

403
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:37,040
set of music in my years. I looked up on stage and put it I see, but Matthew Ebal, and I was really

404
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,000
shocked because you introduced me to Matthew through the DSC gosh, I don't know.

405
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:52,000
Years ago, year and a half ago at least. So I was able to go up on stage and talk to Matthew

406
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,480
and fortunately enough, he had both of his albums, both the beer and coffee albums and the new

407
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,880
album that he's got out. I guess goodbye to Planet Earth. But I was able to pay him 20 bucks

408
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,400
and bought both albums and left happy. But I just wanted to let you know that I was thinking about

409
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,480
you, but hopefully I'll get back into the habit of the Charlie scene. Dr. later.

410
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,800
Right on. Cool man, welcome back. And that's totally okay. You know, life gets in the way it

411
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,920
shit. That's what happens every single time. You'll want to check in with the daily source code

412
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:34,320
and life just kind of gets in the way, which is also what happens to me in producing the damn show.

413
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,160
All right, you asked for it. You got it. Sally went down Matthew Ebal on the Charlie

414
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:47,600
from Hell. Stinky.

415
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,680
Right. What's he with? Oh, buddy, but you never saw the life never heard the train coming

416
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:22,400
when he did it in the back. Sally went down. Sally went down.

417
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:32,960
Ew.

418
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,400
Set it with a cabbage. Something for my head.

419
00:21:46,400 --> 00:22:02,600
What you got, come with me up, not to have me now, it's a girl I'm like her gonna do.

420
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:13,400
Sadden never made it to the world never saw the black never even heard the drink coming.

421
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Sadden I went walked on the track, never where the rails took and never thought to love it.

422
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Sadden not to see what's doing right, but she went home early, but she never saw the black never heard the drink coming when it hit her in the back.

423
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,400
Sadden went down, sadly went down.

424
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Sadden didn't want to get it all, never seen before her.

425
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Keep it down, walk around the track, maybe they would just ignore her.

426
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:07,400
But she kept her head down, she kept her head down, she kept her head down, she kept her head down.

427
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,400
She didn't listen to the man anymore.

428
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Sadden!

429
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,400
No, no, no, no, no.

430
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Sadden never made it to the world never saw the black never even heard the drink coming.

431
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Sadden always walked on the track, never where the rails took and never thought to love it.

432
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Sadden thought that she was doing right, but she went home early, but she never saw the black never heard the drink coming when it hit her in the back.

433
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Sadden went down, sadly went down.

434
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Sadden went down.

435
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,400
From the pod save music network link to that in the show notes a daily source code dot com.

That's apparently the internet is down here in the hotel, so it's been a fine fubar all the way around, hasn't it?

438
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,400
