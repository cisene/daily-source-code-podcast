Time to play where in the world is Adam Curry.

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
He was in Spain. He was in the UK.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Two days later, he shows up in San Francisco.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He's everywhere. He's like a fugitive. Where is he going? What's he running from? Huh?

Hope it helps you baby, wanna wing it with me.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
I don't have a lot of money, I can do it.

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Don't give me what you want, I'll be on my move.

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
In the mood.

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,680

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
In the mood.

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
It didn't make my life play a little more now.

45
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,680

We're all done

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:35,280
Hey, remember I told you the lady Patricia was working on some special project, there you have it.

92
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,320
The Star Sisters strike back. Better known as the Nilfs. Oh man, if you're into that dancing

93
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,320
with the star stuff, well, this is the kind of music those people love. I gotta say, I kind

94
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,480
of like it myself. It's awesome. I love the military cadence at the beginning there. Now it's

95
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:01,760
not pod safe yet. However, check this out. And this was something the lady P worked on quite

96
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,080
a bit with her record company or the record company she's been with for 20 years or something

97
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,520
like that. They're going to put it up on the pod set music network. They have a publishing company,

98
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,200
so they have all the rights, all the ASCAP, BMI, everything's covered. I did say to the to the

99
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,920
the record company and said, just send me that in writing. Okay. And then I'll be happy to help you

100
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,640
get that up on the pod set music network. Should be up sometime this week. And she will be performing

101
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:40,240
that live on dancing with the stars in the Netherlands on Sunday, May 6th. And she's, you know,

102
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,000
I love my wife man. She's nuts. She's really, she's off the race with this one. She will have

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,680
video. I'm sure we're going to put it up on pod show when a video of the show. It's going to be a

104
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,760
lot of fun. I've actually been working on getting 30 of the royal Dutch marines onto the show.

105
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,760
And it's just, it's a creative project. And she's completely, completely embedded into this.

106
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,200
And it's cool. I like it. This was obviously a remix of a song that she had a number one hit with.

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,080
And I think in 1981 or 1982, they went through so much trouble trying to find the original master

108
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,560
that had been some flooding in one of the studios. And it's like, you know, this is all magnetic

109
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,800
tape days, right? These are big 24 track magnetic tapes. And it's been quite a project.

110
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,520
Anyway, coming to you from Northern California right here overlooking the bay. It is the Curry

111
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,120
condo. This is the daily source code episode 587. Thank you so much for being along for the ride.

112
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,440
I got in this afternoon. Boy, what an interesting trip. First of all, you know, we got back

113
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,680
late. I should say early Sunday morning, really Saturday night. And you're not going to believe

114
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:59,280
what happened to us. Or to me, really, over the course of two days. So we arrive at like

115
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,680
130 in the morning. And of course, you know, our temporary visas are being turned into permanent

116
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,600
visas. And so I have all this paperwork I have to show from the home office. And it's, you know,

117
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,280
big pain in the ass. So we're like 10 minutes, maybe 15 minutes at immigration. And okay,

118
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,880
so when they stamp everything they'll let us through. And just about everyone's already got

119
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,280
there, their suitcase and they're all gone. And Andy, of course, who would win with us on vacation,

120
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,040
Christina's bow, her boyfriend, which I got to tell you a story about in a second.

121
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,000
You know, he says, oh, okay, there's only a couple left. And here's yours. And he, you know,

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,760
I have a really beautiful, to me roller bag, a big one. And I, and I cost a lot of money. And I

123
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,400
said, you know, it's like $700 for a suitcase. But I travel so much. It really at the end of the day

124
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,120
is well worth it because, you know, basically it hangs together. And there's also not a lot of them.

125
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,960
And it's just, it's, it's a, it's a really good travel case. And it's convenient, you know,

126
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,760
it's got a pop-up handle on wheels and the whole thing. And, you know, it might's pretty distinctive.

127
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,400
It's a, it's a standard, it's a standard bag. It's got the, you know, the leather tag on it. And then there's

128
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:14,000
a gold virgin flyer club card or whatever. And so he brings this over and I'm like, wow,

129
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,560
there's a lock on it. My lock was cut off by the TSA. I mean, how can the lock did they put a new lock on it?

130
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,480
Then of course, I realized that the gold card on the, on the suitcase is not a virgin gold card,

131
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,680
but a British airways gold card. So now it's like 145. It's like two in the morning and like,

132
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,160
oh my God, someone picked up my suitcase. And there's a still here. It's the middle of the night

133
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:47,760
word, Gatwick Airport, North Terminal. I was like, f**k, f**k, f**k, f**k. I mean, what are the chances,

134
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,480
right, of both the same bags coming in from Tenerife, exact same configuration, the only difference

135
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,440
being a lock. And of course, mine is heavier than all shit. But I guess someone, you know,

136
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,280
this guy's suitcase was pretty heavy too. So anyway, so I take this bag off. I roll over,

137
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,000
there is a baggage services, there's someone there. And right at that very moment, thank

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,720
goodness, the guy was in the parking lot. And he realized that that he had the wrong suitcase.

139
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,280
So he found someone on the other side of customs and they communicated with the baggage. And

140
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,360
he was really nice guy. You know, we were both laying out. So we went through, by the way, it's a

141
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,800
great way to smuggle shit. Let me tell you, because when that happens, no one checks you. Like,

142
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,320
oh yeah, let's go find the guy. They forget to look at your suitcase. Nothing I had any

143
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,320
contraband with me, of course. And so the guy was on the other side, you know, really nice thing

144
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,960
was a Scottish. And, you know, we laughed about it for a few minutes and shook hands. And so we took off.

145
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,440
Okay. So just keep that part of the story in mind. Let me just cycle back for a second.

146
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,200
The headphone earlobe for those of you who had not been following along.

147
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,840
Fuck you, already knew that didn't you. I'm so confused with the time you

148
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,200
already talked about that on yesterday's show. Here, oh, he's what I want to say about Andy.

149
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:09,040
So Christina and Andy, they share their own suite right next door to ours. They're very grown-up kids.

150
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,680
I have to say, you know, that's almost 17. He's 17. So what are you going to do, right?

151
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,680
And everything was peachy keen until he decided to dunk her in the pool.

152
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,600
And I think she had just blow dried her hair or some shit like that. And she, she threw all

153
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,760
his shit in the pool. I'm talking about his bag. He's close. I like, oh, yeah. That's my daughter. I love it.

154
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,560
Okay. So, um, spend a little bit of time at home on Sunday. Of course,

155
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,920
had to, you know, go to the doctor, have the headphone earlobe checked out.

156
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,480
And the Monday morning, it picked up because coming to San Francisco. And, you know, Virgin,

157
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,800
they sent the car for me. So I'm, uh, off to the airport, you know, struggling to be on time as usual.

158
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,000
And it's a madhouse in the Virgin lounge. I mean, it's like there's a, there's a band playing,

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,880
there's a million people. I'd never seen anything like it. What the hell is going on?

160
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:12,880
Well, it's our inaugural flight to Chicago. And, uh, so this is all press. And, uh, it was great.

161
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,440
You know, I was talking to some folks from, uh, Sky News, from Bloomberg.

162
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,840
Um, oh, there's this guy, uh, what's his name? Uh, he does the business travel report on CNN, Richard.

163
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,120
He's, he's a total whack job. If you've ever seen that show, then you, you know, exactly

164
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,720
I'm talking about. Anyway, you know, I went up to him and I said, hey, man, I really love your show.

165
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,680
I got your fucking wacky. You know, come on over to the dark side. He actually seemed pretty interested.

166
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,040
And I said, when he's in San Francisco, he'd look us up right.

167
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,680
Probably see each other in London before that. And, uh, guess who else was there? Sir Richard.

168
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,200
And his parents. So, uh, I went over and I said, uh, excuse me, Sir Richard. Uh, I'm a, I'm a paying

169
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,560
punter. A punter, by the way, is kind of the kind of, is that like slang, I guess, English slang for, uh,

170
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:09,040
just a dumb, dumb fuck who pays? I'm paying punter, you know, congratulations. I really love your

171
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,000
airline. Man, he was a, but a nice guy. But it was really weird. He shook my right hand with his left hand.

172
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,960
I wasn't too sure at all that was about. Okay. Anyway. So, um, so it was, it was just a mad house in the,

173
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,120
in the virgin clubhouse. Uh, then they got on the plane, you know, by the way, delayed for an hour.

174
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,480
I don't know what that was all about. I came in late from New York as getting out of New York

175
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,240
apparently was a nightmare. So, uh, we left late, um, you know, typical flight. What I watch, um,

176
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,000
the pursuit of happiness, the wheel Smith movie. That was pretty cool. Like that. I've been reading

177
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,280
another book, uh, the third secret, which is, uh, kind of like, uh, the Vinci code type book

178
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,120
and arrive at San Francisco and, uh, everything's fine. You know, I go through, uh, immigration.

179
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,240
I'm there, uh, waiting for my bag and, uh, all the bags go by and, uh, my bag's not there. I do notice,

180
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,720
of course, another two me bag, um, just like mine, but it has a, um, it had a, uh, like a ribbon

181
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,280
tied around the handle. So, like, okay, well, that's not mine. I didn't tie ribbon around it.

182
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,040
And I'm waiting, I'm waiting, then everyone gets their bags. And then, of course, there's like three

183
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,120
bags left. One of them, which is the fucking two me bag with a ribbon wrapped around it. And

184
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,520
exactly, how is it possible that would happen to me twice in as many days? So, I look at the tag

185
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,960
and there's like Amy Frederickson or something and there's a number and I call the number.

186
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,280
Hello, it's Amy. I said, Amy, it's Adam. Do you have all your bags? Yeah. I said, well,

187
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,720
there's one of your bags here and it's a two me bag. Do you have your two me bag? Yeah. Well,

188
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,840
I think that's my two me bag. Didn't you notice? It was like 8 million pounds and didn't have a ribbon

189
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:55,040
on it. She was already 15 minutes away from the airport. So, she had to turn around and come back to

190
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,080
said, uh, I'm in a BMW X5. So, I'm standing out there by the corner. I got, I swear to God,

191
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,400
a black Beamer X5 pulls up with five cute chicks in it. Oh, sorry, three cute chicks.

192
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,240
And they're like really apologetic and we swap bags and I went to my condo like good married boy.

193
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,760
And my ears, I have I have stuff like all this cotton, you know, padding and wattage because

194
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,800
it's the headphones man. I got to be really careful. I do not want to have a resurgence of the

195
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,760
headphone earlobe. No, I don't like the in ear experience of like the iPod headphones. I really

196
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,240
need to have phones that cover my entire ear. But this is very, you can hear now that the tape is actually

197
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:50,160
sticking to the headphones. So, a lot of great responses about the, about the first of the savon

198
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,920
series having come extra blogger on yesterday talking about mobile phone industry and about the

199
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,640
French elections briefly. I have to say pretty much everybody was completely positive about that.

200
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,440
So, talking to another savon today, docks or what we're talking about, the death of web radio,

201
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,480
of web casting because I think it's, I don't know. I mean, podcasting, of course, I think is,

202
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,960
you know, huge growth curve and part of that is because the total, you know, just routing around

203
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,640
the mainstream music business and using creative commons, licensed songs and podcast music, etc.

204
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:39,040
But docks or else, he knows a shitload about radio. He knows about the streaming stuff and

205
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:46,080
he's just an interesting guy and he's an a-lister. So, we'll be talking to him later as the

206
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:54,720
official savon for today's show, one in a series of many. Hello Adam. This is Tokyo Dan and it's

207
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,520
been a while since I've given you any feedback. And I know that you prefer feedback from listeners

208
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,120
rather than podcasts these days, but I have something I have to say in this time it's not positive.

209
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,360
Man, what has happened with the pod safe music network? Absolutely nothing. That's right.

210
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,280
It's still in the same sorry beta state it was a year ago. It's like it has been forgotten about.

211
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,520
A year ago is exciting and more than acceptable because it was new. But a year later it's unforgivable.

212
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,840
I mean, have you ever tried to do a simple search? It's almost fucking useless. For example,

213
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:42,960
I select R&B as a genre, enter a simple keyword such as Love and 62 result pages are returned,

214
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,520
but not just R&B tunes, but songs and every other genre that's on the PMN are returned.

215
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,840
All right, hold on a second Tokyo Dan because I see you got more than a minute left of this rant.

216
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,320
Okay, let me tell you, um, first of all, search your absolutely right, sucks.

217
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,640
However, you can do a genre sort. So if you just select R&B and don't put in a search term,

218
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,840
it will show you all the R&B tracks. I'm not saying that that's right.

219
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,240
But it definitely is one thing you can do. Now, I don't use the pod safe music network necessarily for searching,

220
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,560
but please rest assured. We're quite aware that it sucks and we're actually implementing

221
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:32,880
a new search across everything. So the search that works and I think the results are beautiful at

222
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,960
podshow.com and podshow.com slash music. You might want to try that. I comes from the same

223
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,920
database for more about that in a minute. So we are implementing a better search across the board.

224
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,600
Absolutely agree. As search, you could even miss, you could even misspell like one letter

225
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,400
and it won't give you results. So it sucks. But, you know, it's like dude,

226
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,400
there's a lot of stuff going on. Okay. Next try the same thing under advanced search.

227
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,480
Nothing is returned. Not an advanced search is just to make you feel happy like you did some like

228
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,000
it did something. That's never worked for me. Come on. I know there are some R&B songs with the

229
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,360
keyword love. No way, man. It's for artists on the PMN. If they sell their music and have some money

230
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,040
in the PMN, there's no easy to find information about how to get their money out of the PMN.

231
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I know the artists have to contact podshow and request a check. But outside of the USA,

232
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,480
a 20 or 30 dollar US check costs more to cash than it's worth. Jesus Christ, why can't you

233
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,720
implement a system as simple an elegant as PayPal? Oh boy. Oh, how I wish we could implement

234
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:52,240
something as simple an elegant as PayPal. But doesn't quite work as well if you want to have

235
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,080
a repository where you can go back and download the song you want as many times as you want the

236
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:06,320
song that you bought believe me. And also, at the time when we implemented what is it that

237
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,720
click and buy, I think there were a whole bunch of other huge benefits which really allowed a

238
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,720
lot more people to be able to buy through the system. Now just just to reiterate, we added this just

239
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,880
as an option. We don't make any money from it. It's 99 cents. I think it's nine cents that goes

240
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,520
to click and buy for processing. We take nothing. The artist gets everything. So for a little bit

241
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,440
of extra hassle, I think, you know, we are basically, you know, the fucking you get what you pay for.

242
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,000
But okay, point taken. I think there are better systems now. But you can understand why that was

243
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,880
on a little bit of a lesser priority than a lot of the other things we've been doing recently.

244
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,920
Man, Adam, by the way, there's no reason to take the Lord's name in vain on this.

245
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,840
Really disappointed with the PMN. I used to really go after artists to get their music on the PMN.

246
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,000
I told him it was a new way to market and sell their music. It looked like the wave of the future.

247
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,360
Well, now the PMN is just a ripple of the past. And I'm too embarrassed to ask artists to put

248
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,920
their music on the pod safe music network. I guess the pod safe music network was just the first

249
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,200
stepping stone you used to create your pod show empire. Now that you got all the content,

250
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,320
you need not to generate a profit from advertisers. You don't really give a shit about the artist

251
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,280
that help you build the base of your empire. You know, that's it, Adam. That's all I have to say.

252
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,280
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel. All right, Tokyo, Dan. Well, that of course is quite

253
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:46,160
offensive. What you say at the end there, particularly if you know that in 2006, over 250 million

254
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:53,920
spins were generated through the pod safe music network. So that's just songs that were played

255
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:01,120
from the pod safe music network and were reported back. And by the way, that mechanism is very

256
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,040
much alive and kicking. Is the pod safe music network dead? No, absolutely not. Have you seen how

257
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:13,680
many new songs come on every single day? No, it's growing exponentially. Now, the things that

258
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:20,000
you'd like to see fix, which you say, you know, to say that we don't care about it or that, you know,

259
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,040
oh, we have enough content. Now, fuck it all. No, have you not noticed, perhaps, that we actually

260
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:31,920
integrated the pod safe music network into the listener side. So podshow.com slash music. Now,

261
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,960
you can access all those songs, all of the charts, all of the plays, also what shows they

262
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,280
didn't play it on. That's not just template work, okay? I mean, there's logins to consider. You

263
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,120
have to, you know, have a universal log in. There's a whole bunch of crap that came with that.

264
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,400
I took a long time, dude. You know, send me some programmers who will get everything done for your

265
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,200
liquidity split. You know, at the same time, we have to deal with bandwidth. We have to deal with

266
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:02,560
all kinds of stuff. So, a little bit of leniency would be nice, okay? Just give us a little bit of

267
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,400
a break. I understand that you don't like the way stuff is, and we'll try and make it better. But

268
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,280
that type of comment, I think it's just I'm called for. Hi, Adam. It's Matthew calling from Australia.

269
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,560
I was tempted to call and leave a message after listening to the CSV interview last week. But I'm

270
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:27,120
glad I waited until this week, and heard your interview with him on the Monday show. I really

271
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,720
preferred that. I thought it was a much more interesting, so to listen to. And I encourage you to keep

272
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,880
up with the interviews. I think it's a great idea for a new format. Keep up with the work. Thanks.

273
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,120
All right, man. And I appreciate you calling it and saying that as I said, most everybody thought

274
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,120
it was a good idea to look at the, you know, rehash the format a little bit.

275
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:53,200
Um, well, I forgot something really important. Okay. Let me, let me, let me play the, uh,

276
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,080
fuck. Oh, I'm such an idiot. You know why? Because I'm looking at the clock. I'm looking like 22

277
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,840
minutes. I'm like, oh, I've got to stop for the satellite window. And then I thought, oh, no,

278
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:09,600
there's something I had to tell you guys. I couldn't tell you this. You know, I was in New York,

279
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,960
and we have having meetings with Syrius. We've been going back and forth. And I really couldn't

280
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,320
say anything about what has been going on because I wanted to make sure that everyone who's been

281
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,080
contributing to the pod show on Syrius, uh, that they knew what was going on first. And in fact,

282
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,680
let me, um, we sent an email today to all the shows that are participated. I'll just read it to

283
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,240
you for a bit of them because it really does explain exactly what's going on. And a couple of you

284
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,560
already been sending me questions, although not a lot, but I certainly got five or six questions about this.

285
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,240
Okay, this is, uh, from Richard Brueher, hey, and of course, I'm on a list as well. Hi,

286
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,320
guys, as you know, we've been investing in making significant enhancements and improvements to

287
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,120
the pod show network where the launch of our new colo, that's a co-location of the data barn last

288
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,600
week. We've created the infrastructure necessary to take our partners and programming to the next level.

289
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,800
Over the past months, we've begun to develop opportunities for distribution into new markets and

290
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,680
across exciting platforms and network to the same time. We've been reviewing our current relationships

291
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,000
with a goal of focusing our energies where we'll get the most return our investment for pod show

292
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,120
our producers and our audience. As you are aware, the radio market is undergoing a massive restructuring

293
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,160
with the merger of Sirius and XM, the pending rollout of digital radio and the new licensing of

294
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,240
internet radio. We believe it is an incredibly opportunistic time one that we are uniquely

295
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,040
positioned to take advantage of. Our relationship with Sirius was exclusive and although very

296
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,080
positive for the past two years has become less productive for both parties. At the same time,

297
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,880
new opportunities are coming up that are more core to our progress. We have therefore

298
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,080
terminated our exclusive relationship with Sirius and have begun to review a variety of options.

299
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,240
Now, this, of course, frees up producers, PWF, and Brian Know to help drive the production of

300
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,160
some of these great opportunities and to focus on enhancing the production quality of audio

301
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,480
content on our network. We'll keep you posted on all new developments as they come to fruition.

302
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,400
On behalf of Ron Adam and all of us here, thank you very much for your hard work. You've been

303
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,800
part of the first podcast indication to any other platform for congratulations. You help make

304
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,920
pod show and pod casting history. So I wanted to make sure that I told you that.

305
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,000
It would have been nice to have been able to finish up and then have a good buy show,

306
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:30,560
but that show this folks. What can I say? Okay, so back to the savant segment.

307
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,840
I think I'm going to be able to get at least one savant in episode. Now, the trick of course is

308
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,680
to get all the shit into the show without making it extremely long with the interview.

309
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,960
And by the way, I want you to know that this format change doesn't mean that I don't

310
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,280
student want naked pictures and shit like that. Okay? So a few free to send those. And of course,

311
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,880
keep your comments coming into the phone numbers. Here's the UK number.

312
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:14,400
7 5 3 plus 4 4 2 0 7 6 8 1 3 7 5 3. So welcome to the daily source code Doc Serals on the

313
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,720
eve of of your trip to Brussels. So I'm glad you could take it just a few moments because you

314
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,720
sir are a true savant in every sense of the word, particularly when you have to cover a few things.

315
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,280
Well, when it comes to web radio, actually, I think when it comes to radio in general, I mean,

316
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,000
I've been reading your weblog for many years. You always have the inside track. You always have an

317
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,400
interesting take. You come at radio from a little different perspective than I do, I think.

318
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:48,720
And you've been blogging a lot about the changes in the fees to be paid for music.

319
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,280
Is this the copyright royalty board? Is that who made this decision?

320
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,880
The thing is that the, I was a very long story. I'll try to make it as short as possible,

321
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,160
but it started probably before the DMCA, but the DMCA is a good, a good place to sort of,

322
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,200
that's the digital millennium copyright act. Yeah, the digital millennium copyright act, which was

323
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:18,160
past I think in October of 1998. And a moment of things left unclear was what, what online,

324
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,280
what, what, what U.S. Broadcast, I should say webcasting stations playing,

325
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,880
or I double-A license music would pay to the organization created by the I double-A called

326
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,840
sound exchange in royalties. And let me just stop here there for one second, Doc. Does that mean

327
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,800
it's the only fee you have to pay for using licensed music, or do you also have to pay

328
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:47,440
ASCAP BMI on top of that stuff? As I, as I understand it, that, that's, that's still owed,

329
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:54,720
but that's, it's, it's so not a gating factor that it's not really been part of the conversation,

330
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:03,680
that the, from the beginning, the R I double-A wanted to charge the, the webcasters, the

331
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:09,520
maximum possible amount. They wanted to do with online radio with their never-letoo, with broadcast

332
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,480
radio, and which is basically set the term by which the music was used. And so they set really

333
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,840
would amounted to pretty heinous terms. And there's a lot of back and forth at the end of which

334
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,520
they're, through something called a copyright arbitration royalty panel or clerk. Originally,

335
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,520
we still, I think, copyright royalty arbitration cattle, but it makes still that out.

336
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:38,320
That was crap, yeah. Yeah, and so, and so that, that was, that was settled by Senator

337
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,920
Jesse Helms, that he was, it was partying from the Senate, mostly on behalf of the religious

338
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,760
broadcasters who realized that they would be completely screwed along with everybody else.

339
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,360
Okay, so let me, let me just set this doc because it's really complicated stuff when it comes to

340
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,840
rights and royalties. So essentially, now streaming goes back, I guess you're right to 1998,

341
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,160
and it was okay, you know, since it's not a download, we'll, we'll let you stream our music

342
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,880
because what, you know, stream license music, but you're going to have to pay a special fee for that.

343
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:16,160
Probably not dissimilar to a subscription fee to a music service in a way, like Napster or,

344
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,960
or, you know, one of these other subscription-based systems. And is that incorrect?

345
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:32,480
I'm not sure, here's what they wanted from the beginning is to charge on a per listener,

346
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,920
per song basis, and they wanted to impose those reporting requirements on the stations, and they wanted

347
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,680
to, basically they said that they're, you know, we, we think this is, first of all, they characterize it as a

348
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,000
performance, okay, and the most of the performance rights goes back to the fees, I think.

349
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,280
That's, you should be asked, but the point is they wanted the stations, they said basically,

350
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,040
here's what it costs, and you guys have to pay this, and you don't care if the place you had a business

351
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,920
or not. And, and a kind of settlement was reached in in 2002, and everybody kind of thought,

352
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,400
well, that's kind of gone away, at least on a listing side. I, I paid very close attention to this

353
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,840
for a number of years, and they didn't pay any more attention to it, until early this year,

354
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:21,760
when something called the copyright royalty board, which nobody heard of, suddenly shows up and says,

355
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,880
oh, no, you're, here's a new rate, oh, but a winner, a hell of a higher than you've ever seen before.

356
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,240
And this time, everybody got thrown into it, there was a, there was a quiet, uh, what was called a

357
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,840
card of out for the non-commercial stations that were separate deals with the RWA, that that

358
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,640
includes the NPR stations and other non-commercial stations. They got thrown in there too, so everybody

359
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:49,360
from clear channel to NPR to all the little Pacific stations and ordinary webcasters, and for that

360
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,440
matter, podcasters who are streaming, it's a different set of rules for streaming. All got thrown into

361
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,640
the same pod and suddenly had the same problem. And, and the problem is basically there is,

362
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,840
for the smaller guys, there's, nobody has yet imagined or put into practice the business model

363
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,240
that will allow them to pay these rates. So essentially, it's a debt sentence for web streamers

364
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,360
in the US. Okay, but, but here's, here's what I don't understand. First of all, who is

365
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,400
creating web streams, I mean, everyone, it kind of gets lumped into web radio, and to me,

366
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,360
radio is something completely different than a live 365 channel that's basically a playlist.

367
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,320
The people who are hurt most are the people who are just streaming together playlists,

368
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,800
and, um, and I guess trying to make money with that somehow, or like, is it like Pandora or

369
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,480
last FM? Are these the guys that are getting getting hit the hardest? Or is it a clear channel

370
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,240
who, uh, will have to turn off their streams, boo-hoo, I'm crying? Right, and the crucials turned

371
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,200
them off before. Um, like, the clear channel is a player in this, but, of course, nobody knows

372
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,920
it's going to be behind the scenes there, but the, um, if it's being streamed, if it's live,

373
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,440
then it's considered a performance, and, and the, the IW wants to, wants you as the, as the,

374
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,280
as the medium of that, whether you're a robotic playlist or a live radio station,

375
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:27,040
but that's, that's, that's kind of my point is, you know, who's being hurt by these fees?

376
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,680
You know, it's, well, there's a people being hurt by the scenes of most are the,

377
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:38,080
if it's what I'm concerned or should say, are, are the actual, be going, um, radio stations

378
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,840
on the net, that, that people don't, I don't want to knock anybody in live 365,

379
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,600
I don't know, I'm not definitely aware of it, but, but radio paradise, um,

380
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,160
the, I mean, I have about a hundred stations that I can listen to live on my sonos system

381
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,800
here at the house. How many people are listening to the, to these streams,

382
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,120
Doc, I mean, isn't really that, is it really, and, I never hear anything about it. Really,

383
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,760
oh yeah, hell of a, listen, I was, I was talking to, um, at the Brooklyn Center,

384
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,120
we've been working with, um, with, with the, with the public broadcasting folks

385
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,680
coming up with, uh, a model to improve, um, uh, their, their revenues from, from their listeners,

386
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,920
and, and it's talking to a guy with a, a pretty large, well, I can't say what it is,

387
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,440
it's definitely one way to see in New York, and, and I jokingly said, well, I'm your listener

388
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,800
on the list code, he said, well, there are 10,000 of you, and this sometimes 20,000 of you.

389
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,120
It's a rapidly growing percentage of their total listenership, um, and it's, and I had no idea,

390
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,920
and he said, there's much more countable, um, on, um, online, and it is on, uh, through the air,

391
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:44,080
then you've already tried to go, go back to the, uh, but, okay, so, so for, for radio stations,

392
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,840
uh, that already have a terrestrial signal, um, and they, you know, so they want to expand their,

393
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,720
um, their market, and they're doing so by providing streams, which I understand, they make,

394
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,200
they make, so they're just not just, I mean, it's, it's radio paradise, which is, which is online, only.

395
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,320
Online, but, okay, but radio paradise is, but Doc, is it, is it, is it, is it just the music

396
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,640
that makes radio paradise, so special, is it, oh, God, no, no, it's, it's built, it's built, it's built,

397
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,000
it's built, so, so why, so why would, it is the personality and he's the guy who puts it together, um,

398
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,600
you know, there's a, there's a whole week radio out of Alaska, right?

399
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,240
There are a couple of people who are doing this thing out of a shack and have been doing it for years and they do and all of a good job

400
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,960
Right, but what I mean so they could easily use

401
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
a music under different license they could use

402
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,040
Music license on a creative commons they could use the policy using our work that you know garage ban

403
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,520
If you're in authority on music that happens which is I mean 90

404
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,680
You know

405
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:48,000
90-some percent of the music that's running through most of our heads is you know above a certain age is

406
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,200
Stuffy for the radio and that but bought a record source and to say oh you can't play that at all

407
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,520
You know, it just doesn't work for a lot of people

408
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,440
I mean to be a definitely worship people are dealing only in positive music for example or and you know

409
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,120
I mean look I'm the I'm the first person to say I hated because I really miss playing

410
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,880
You know the soundtrack to my life. I'm

411
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,920
Miss sharing that with my listeners. I think it's a travesty and I really despise the fact that I can't do it

412
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,720
But it's just a fact, you know, this so this this seems to me like this is being blown out of proportion

413
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,720
We're something that we know we saw this coming years ago doc we knew that it would never work

414
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,760
It will be so coming but at the same time everybody again, you know

415
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,200
Clear channel NPR and and the small webcaster and the rest of nobody expected it to be

416
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,440
But the royalty panel to make the decision that they did they heard one side they heard the other side and

417
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,480
They expected the

418
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,400
The decision to come down somewhere in the middle. It didn't come down in the middle out of nowhere and nobody expected it

419
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,280
It came down entirely on the side of the yard of a way and sound exchange and that's

420
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,640
That's been a complete shock and so

421
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,200
I mean for again for people who who you know or for whom it's okay that

422
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:08,840
That something as unjust as this happens. Well fine, but you know for a lot of people

423
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:14,320
It's you know who are putting out radio that does play the sound track of our lives

424
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,480
It's this not good. It's you know and and it's not accepted. I mean why should we put up with that?

425
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,120
Why should that be okay? Why should it be okay?

426
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,920
For the you know for the record industry to muscle Congress into putting a an nascent business

427
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,720
Out I mean that that's basically they're doing the killing of business the killing of it

428
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,080
It's just starting out and they're doing it on purpose. I mean, it's just an amazing thing to talk

429
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,720
Have dead. Okay. Here's my take on it. So yeah, I mean, I don't know about the putting out of business

430
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,920
part of it because look, you know, it's it's their property

431
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,960
They've they've had a monopoly over

432
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,280
Remusic in the way it's licensed and how it's used for for many many years

433
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:00,280
In in podcasting, I think we pretty much saw that there was just no way through it. So let's go around it and

434
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,920
For my money, I think maybe

435
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:10,360
We could take all this energy and we could create the soundtrack or the lives of our children or something like that

436
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:16,120
You know, it's oh, it's pretty egotistical at this point. I agree that at the end of the day the listener loses

437
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,040
Because

438
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,680
There's just songs that my daughter is growing up with songs that she should you know that she should know about

439
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:30,040
She's never gonna hear because they're not played on the radio and they're certainly, you know, not played on podcasts and they're just not available and that is a

440
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
Travesty, but

441
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,720
Don't you think we should just

442
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,160
Get on with it and say all right. Well, you know, because I think either the

443
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,160
Obviously, it's not a strategy for the future for for the for the

444
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,160
mainstream

445
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,160
Music industry

446
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,280
I think that they'll either have to come around and and change their views if everyone says, okay, screw it

447
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,280
We're just gonna go play this other stuff or

448
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
They'll die

449
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,080
Right, but but that's

450
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:02,440
I think they can do both. I think on the one hand they can play the other stuff and and on the other hand they can fight

451
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,960
What's happened?

452
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:10,680
I also think by the way, and I want to completely switch my point of view on this because I think I think I think there are ways of dealing with it

453
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,960
But we can't deal with it

454
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,160
I'm the supply side. That's what I'm working on at the Birken Center Harvard right now is coming up with

455
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,320
With instruments on the listening side there's a whole category of

456
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,840
So after that hasn't been created yet and tools and haven't been created yet that that give

457
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:35,560
Not just listeners, but but give customers ways of dealing with vendors that they don't have right now and now and you're here's a way of looking at it

458
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,600
So

459
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,280
And I'll just talk about I'll talk about public radio for a second. This is an interesting thing

460
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,160
So if you're in any room with middle class people in the US

461
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:49,240
It's a family people here listening listening listen to public radio and almost all the hands go up and and you say okay

462
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,800
How many actually pay for it and most of the hands come down 10% go up then you mess this?

463
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,000
How many of you would pay for it? It was easy at all the hands go back up again

464
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,720
The problem is it's not easy. Now a color that with with with

465
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,720
Music is that

466
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,720
With the honor, I definitely want you to what's the station's to charge even the thousands this antipers song

467
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,920
Okay, and it adds up of course you've got four or five 10

468
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
20,000 listeners at any given time

469
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,160
That adds up to a lot especially if you're not collecting money for it

470
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,640
But what if you could collect money for it? What if we could solve the problem from the listening side of I

471
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,480
I mean if I want to hear I mean just earlier tonight and I was playing with this thing is playing

472
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,200
Six days on the road by Dave Dudley for 1963. It's part of the centric life, right?

473
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,080
I'm gonna fix it to use on the road. I'm gonna go on on my own

474
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,960
Doc you're dating yourself. Yeah, I just want my voice changed to that very song, right?

475
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,240
So I'm gonna imitate Dave Dudley. So anyway, I

476
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,000
So I'm thinking you know, I'd be willing to pay

477
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:55,800
19,000 to this set to hear that song and I would like to be able when I hear it to punch a button on the car radio

478
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,880
Or punch a button on the whatever I'm listening on and say you know, I want to throw it right

479
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,560
I would have also a 20 25,000 to the set in their general right

480
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,720
But Doc you come back to it has nothing to do with web radio is just another way of getting music, you know

481
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,960
It's like you pay for satellite radio you pay for a subscription to Napster you you know, you pay for

482
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,800
Subscription to Yahoo music engine, you know, it's like wouldn't it just be a hell of a lot easier just to buy a subscription?

483
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,960
I mean I have Napster. I love it. You know, I was like, oh, I'd love to hear that song

484
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,920
Here's interesting thing. We we got Rhapsody other subtle system. You listen to it

485
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,440
Mostly, you know coming up to holiday is gonna take a little care to go get a Christmas music channels

486
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,840
We play the Christmas music people come over we play the jazz thing and a plane to class

487
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,840
It's really good and you know why they got a really boring after a while

488
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,800
Yes, because you don't have someone programming it for you

489
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,640
Exactly and how much did they say there is and all that but the interesting thing is the real radio stations

490
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:59,800
I mean I listen to small things is something called care CL in in Salt Lake City awesome freaking radio station

491
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,120
There's a little one in in Fairfield, I like how care you you and you know

492
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,800
They're range on the ground is you know four miles, but I'm in that it's around the world and

493
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,240
And I don't know whether they're playing a Creative Commons music or something else most of it is stuff

494
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,200
I haven't heard before but it's cool shit and and I like listening to it and here

495
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,840
Here's the thing I would like to this is like this is a light and on the one hand

496
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,680
I would like to help the stations fight the R.I.W.A and all that on the other hand

497
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,680
I would like to

498
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,320
Create the tools that make it easy for the listeners easier than ever for the listeners to get money

499
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,800
Directly to the people who are to be artists and for the intermediaries that are doing the job and and through the day

500
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,040
You mean just leaving it up to Napster and

501
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,680
Rhapsody and those is boring. I mean, I would rather have a

502
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,840
You know, you know

503
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,320
And impulse based you know works when I want it to way of doing that. So

504
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,880
Okay

505
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,360
It may be completely bogus. I mean, I work, but I'm trying to make it work. You know, just start about it

506
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,120
Well, when you when you got some news make sure you let me know. I'd love to hear about it

507
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120
I'd love to have you back on the show to talk about that

508
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,920
Well, I'll be glad to come so just tell me what what are you gonna do in Brussels because it talk what the hell do you do?

509
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,920
I mean you you write you

510
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,680
You're you're an a-list blogger. Are you a consultant? I presume?

511
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,840
Yeah, oh, that and it was the the main thing. I mean right now

512
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:23,080
I've entered the the academic phase in my life. I've got a of a

513
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,680
I'll fellowship at the Birken Center at Harvard

514
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,080
And that's what I'm working on

515
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,280
You know, I bet I bet you can pick up chicks with that. Hey, I'm a fellow at the

516
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,080
I'm a race of a baby. Come on over here. Yeah

517
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,280
Yeah, no, no, mostly

518
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,080
I don't know what it does. Anyway, so the but it's fun, but the the other one is that I have a I also the fellowship

519
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,560
But you see a speed here in Santa Barbara where I live to work on

520
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,960
On some other stuff which is too long and complicated going to but it's also cool

521
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,960
The big thing about both is that

522
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,240
Is that I get to save a relationship so two universities that never would have let me in a student so

523
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,400
That's that's pretty cool. I was like a straight beast student in school and uh all right, but now I get you

524
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,640
But you got to eat Doc what what are you doing in Brussels?

525
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,000
This is gonna be my dinner. Okay, so so there

526
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,880
Actually, I'm yeah there are cutters a

527
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,800
There's a I'm meeting with some some folks and I'm some business, but I'm also at a

528
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,880
At a conference called inner identity open space that I've been involved with

529
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,440
Online identity

530
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,360
Development for a number of years and there's been some good salty involved in that, but

531
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,160
More importantly, they'll actually manage to move

532
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,120
Individual based identity forward with open ID and the number of other technologies over the last few days

533
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:44,520
You really turn them out more of the instigators. What's that? You're turning me on now with all this identity talk. It's making me hot

534
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,000
You know good consulting and that course is still right for litics journal. That's my page right right

535
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
It's been my day job for many many years and

536
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,760
That that gets me a lot of you know the information that's good to make money in some other way

537
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:07,480
Okay, well Doc, I I love the stuff you're writing your weblog. I get it through RSS, but I presume is it still docked out weblogs.com?

538
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,880
Yep, I think I've had the

539
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:17,080
The same address longer. I'm not making the last weblogs.com blog. I think yeah, but the last thing is not just the thing say

540
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,720
So we'll be following you. Thanks for for enlightening us

541
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,400
Somewhat here on on on this whole issue

542
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,960
It's very complicated, but you know, I did keep doing what you're doing. It's all you know that the podcasting

543
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,040
There's actual progress there and and you're not pushing the same rock up. They all look wonderful

544
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,240
Hold different rock. Yeah, it's a rock believe me. It's a rock as well

545
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:55,080
All right, Doc, I really appreciate have a great trip to Brussels and I'll send you a list of restaurants for for you. Okay, bye

546
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,360
All right, thank you

547
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,680
What we got from the start to the fall

00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,680
Yeah

549
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:06,600
The time is out to realize what is to be around you what to decide on this fight

550
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,600
Get like your fate

551

What's up to what you should know then you will know where to go control your eggs

552
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,480
And don't look on the face

553
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,360
Who wins no one knows back to you all the trophy

554
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,360
And it's all you've got to

555

Who wins no one knows back to you all the trophy and it's all for that

556
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,720
Oh

The time is out, and we don't mind us, but it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's

559
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:25,720

560
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:54,440
I don't know about the fade out, but hey, Doc Seralsman, a bit you like that song, no fees

561
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:01,340
necessary, crush and soulful battle from the pod tape music network, well, I'm not

562
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:06,700
quite sure what I learned, but I do appreciate Doc Serals taking the time before his

563
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,100
trip to talk about the death of Web Radio.

564
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:14,820
Alright, so for tomorrow I'm looking for a savon who can talk to me about the World Bank

565
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:22,300
and about Wolfowitz, I think it would be perfect for nylon, but I have no idea if nylon

566
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,580
is still listening, haven't heard from him in a while, I don't know what he did while

567
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:32,780
we're on vacation, but he's just kind of disappeared from the face of the earth.

568
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:37,260
And of course, I'd love to hear your suggestions for the rights of on to talk about that,

569
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,820
because that's just something I'd like to discuss tomorrow.

570
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:43,700
It's really hard to do this by the way, I can see where it's 50 minutes right now, and I'm

571
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,300
really trying to keep these interviews at 10 to 15 minutes.

572
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:51,140
What do we do with Doc about 19 minutes, God's field feels a little bit long.

573
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,740
But of course, I had to do a bit of intro, at least three minutes of talking about

574
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,740
what Doc does.

575
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:00,820
Okay, so here in San Fran, all kinds of meetings, all kinds of crap going on, so the shows

576
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:06,100
will be recorded at night, but of course, I know you really like that.

577
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,700
Adam at podshow.com, dailysourcecode.com, hey, we're going to have a fun week, I'll

00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:21,500
