00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Hey, it's Tony Costa telling you to check out this christmaspodcast.com.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,720
It's the official podcast for the new Sony film.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,040
This Christmas starring Chris Brown for Gina King, Columbus Short,

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,720
and an all-star cast.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,400
The site includes a special holiday podcast from yours truly,

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,880
exclusive interviews from the stars in the film,

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,240
and a special red carpet coverage from the premiere.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,160
You can exchange gifts, but you can't exchange family.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,040
This Christmas is truly the next holiday classic.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,360
See it in theaters on November 21st,

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,960
and please check us out at this christmaspodcast.com.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:09,040
I like to think I'm flying into this christmaspodcast.com, it's Adam Curry.

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:50,240
In my mind, I'll rehearse these lines a thousand times.

14
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,880
I guess that I've made that way, I hope you understand.

15
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:07,200
I'll try to make a scene of reason why we just can't go on like this,

16
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,440
watching two of us all apart.

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:19,840
Now the rain is falling, and she's falling apart.

18
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
She's the last forever,

19
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,360
she's the last forever,

20
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,400
she's the last forever, she's the last forever.

21
00:02:49,840 --> 00:03:06,800
She's the last forever, she's the last forever.

22
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,320
She's the last forever, she's the last forever,

23
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,840
she's the last forever, she's the last forever.

24
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,400
I can look her in the eyes,

25
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,080
can't hide, she looks like she's lost a lot,

26
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,520
by her demons looking alone,

27
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,760
as I'm looking at her way.

28
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,520
It's a show on one, a love today.

29
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:47,520
She's the last forever, she's the last forever,

30
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,520
she's the last forever,

31
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,520
she's the last forever, she's the last forever,

32
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,520
she's the last forever,

33
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,520
she's the last forever, she's the last forever,

34
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:45,520
she's the last forever,

35
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:57,520
she's the last forever,

36
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:11,120
I'm really not sure how I, on Mr. Span's record came out, but a year ago, from the UK, PG Devon and 3D.

37
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,720
Tears don't last forever.

38
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
If I'm looking at their page here on the Pod State Music Network, influences, yeah,

39
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,700
no kidding, the Beatles, Green Day, Led Zeppelin, Otis Redding, Sam Cook.

40
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,200
Fanta, one of these guys is still around, no new tracks in November 29th of 2006, great

41
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,040
music to kick off at Tuesday on your daily source code, episode number 690.

42
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:38,200
Well, actually, turns out I somehow skipped two episodes.

43
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,040
Someone pointed this out to me, yes, the only one person emailed me about it.

44
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:49,960
I posted show number 689 yesterday and indeed, looking back on Friday, it was show 686.

45
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:57,560
So 8687 and 689 are MIA, which means I think I'm just going to continue the count from

46
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,840
690 and then somewhere we'll do two secret episodes.

47
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,040
I don't want to mess up people who have a perfect collection, then you have stuff coming

48
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
out in the wrong order.

49
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,760
So, sorry about that.

50
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Ha, must smoke less crack.

51
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:18,640
Hey, another a dreary day here in the UK, it's gray outside, it's wet and, of course, I'm

52
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,440
going to go into the city, battle the traffic, battle the new expanded congestion zone,

53
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,600
which has screwed everything up and let all kinds of people from Chelsea into the city

54
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
for almost zero cost.

55
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Ah, so it goes.

56
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Yeah, we've done some cool shit.

57
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,440
You know, we launched a new show on Monday here in the UK, it's called Spirit Messenger

58
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
with Gordon Smith.

59
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,840
Gordon Smith is a guy who's been getting a lot of attention here in the UK in the past

60
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,480
couple weeks, and maybe even months, he's a psychic, or as we call him a spirit messenger.

61
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,080
He's a medium quite well known, used to be known as the psychic barber in the UK.

62
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,440
I think he's trying to change that image.

63
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,680
I stumbled across him through super agent Keith Bishop several months ago, and we

64
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,760
kept talking about, you know, we really got to do a show and then finally we just sat down

65
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,760
and we just did a show and his great spirit messenger dot podshow dot com.

66
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,400
This guy is pretty unbelievable and he does it in in under 10 minutes, at least that's

67
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,600
what's that's the show that we're making with him.

68
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I don't see why you have to have a spirit show that's longer than 10 minutes.

69
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,360
Get to the point, help these people.

70
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,040
He's actually, he doesn't do a private reading and readings anymore, or even public readings

71
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,800
for that matter.

72
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,800
He's written several books and he's now in the field of grief counseling.

73
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,680
So the entire point of the show is there are people who have lost their loved ones and

74
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,160
they missed them dearly and he helps get in touch with them and counsels them as a medium

75
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,520
he passes on the messages from the spirit world.

76
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,560
It's funny because we've got a couple of people at the office who just don't believe

77
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
in this.

78
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,360
They're working on the show and they're at, you know, really trying to say, you know,

79
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,560
this is just not real and even the biggest critics are now like, well, shit looks

80
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
pretty damn real.

81
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Sounds pretty good.

82
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,000
Ah, let's see, trolling the voicemail line.

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,560
You know, I haven't played the voicemail lines in quite a such a time.

84
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,120
Actually, it turned out that there were more people calling in on the UK voicemail number

85
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
today than the US number.

86
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,480
So I'm going to give you a shot at both for a second.

87
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Here's one for the Yankee Doodles.

88
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,480
Oh, what the hell was that?

89
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Let's try that again.

90
00:08:42,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Now, of course, here's the first message that came through.

91
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,680
All right, I'll write a random fuck you.

92
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
Adam Curry.

93
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
Stop talking about that.

94
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
I'm not.

95
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
All right.

96
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
And I'm going to buy it.

97
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,880
I just bought the N95 and now I have to buy this, you like, to thank you, have a nice day

98
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
and fuck you.

99
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,080
I don't buy it yet, man.

100
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
I haven't received it.

101
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,160
I haven't been able to do a full test yet, so I don't know if it's really going to rock

102
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
that hard.

103
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,520
Actually, I do.

104
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,160
I know it's going to be awesome.

105
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,480
I've been waiting for this one.

106
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,120
This is the device I've been waiting for.

107
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,320
Finally, I think all the pieces are coming together.

108
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,600
I've come together and it's a great intermediary between my cell phone and my computer.

109
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,160
Yeah, I got a page at curry.com.

110
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,560
Then keep your eye on a daily source code.com for a great deal on the N810.

111
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
But first, let's wait until I get my device.

112
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,360
And because if it sucks, if I don't like it, I'm not going to be

113
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,040
hawking it to you.

114
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,320
Trust me, no matter what anyone else does.

115
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,200
But I have a feeling I'm going to like it very much.

116
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,640
I've been spending even more time with my N800 recently.

117
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,160
Last night, I think the, I wonder how long the battery, how many

118
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,560
rechargees you can get on one of these batteries.

119
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,160
They use a standard cell phone battery so that it really lasts a long time

120
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,240
depending on what you're doing.

121
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,600
But I don't know if I just don't know how long the last.

122
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,920
I wonder how long have I had the N800 a year or so?

123
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,240
I should just look that up.

124
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,760
Yeah, I think it's been almost a year.

125
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,920
And let me see, it's still holding in charge.

126
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
I'll check today.

127
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm going to load it full up today.

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,200
And then hopefully tomorrow, if I can eat a show out tomorrow,

129
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,280
let you know how many hours it lasted.

130
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,680
But it does do a pretty good job, which is one of the big, big advantages of this over

131
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,000
any other portable device.

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,560
That was really the bummer with the iPhone.

133
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,400
It's combined with the web surfing I do, which I do a lot of, you know,

134
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,320
just checking me email and looking at other things, Google reader.

135
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,080
I use a lot, I use the phone a lot.

136
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,400
And a seven hour day is just not enough.

137
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,600
I mean, maybe enough for people in Cupertino, but it's not enough for me.

138
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Ah, let's check in with our European Congress.

139
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,440
Come on, come on, strip.

140
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,480
Come on, strip.

141
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Come on, strip.

142
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
Come on, strip.

143
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
Come on, strip.

144
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Come on, strip.

145
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
Come on, strip.

146
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
Come on, strip.

147
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Come on, strip.

148
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Come on, strip.

149
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Come on, strip.

150
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,720
Fancy a carry in a carry.

151
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,680
Mr. Adam carry.

152
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,680
Hiya, here is CSB, your EU correspondent.

153
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,680
So England gets closer to Europe.

154
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,200
Last week on Wednesday, Europe start trains from England to France.

155
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,240
And to Belgium are leaving, not from the shameful water load station.

156
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,560
You know, French is where I'm meeting at Waterloo.

157
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,240
But from Renewed, Saint-Pavent-Cath station.

158
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,800
Yeah, what's up with that?

159
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,120
Wait a minute, I thought it came in the Waterloo station, or at least on the Euro rail side,

160
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,320
the Euro Star side of the Waterloo station, which is quite nice compared to Waterloo

161
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,040
station itself, which is my station.

162
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
I thought they were going in there.

163
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,520
Now, travel to England, from England to Europe, short ends by 20 minutes.

164
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,880
And after 2012, it will be even possible to go from England to Germany, from which

165
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,040
original Anglo-Saxons came from anyway.

166
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,240
So happy on the road to you, Adam.

167
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
You.

168
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Ha ha.

169
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,040
Happy Emery to you, to my friend.

170
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,320
Although the pound has lost a little bit against the Euro on the dollar recently, which

171
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,360
is in a way kind of nice.

172
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,680
I still have lots of Euro, so that works for me.

173
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
Forget getting dollars.

174
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,680
That's just the sad state of affairs.

175
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,120
Yeah, this high-speed train stuff is pretty cool.

176
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,680
And I think it's a lot more convenient than the airports these day.

177
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,560
Well, of course, you know, with the Delta Shira, with my own craft, it's the easiest of

178
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
all.

179
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,560
But yeah, it seems like, in fact, the girls were talking to me about going to Disneyland

180
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,320
Paris just before the Christmas holiday, which I think is a great idea.

181
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,120
I do, I am a sucker for Disneyland, I have to say, and you particularly when everything's

182
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
just right.

183
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
So that's what they do with Disney.

184
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,360
Everything's just kind of right.

185
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,480
It's the way you expect it to be.

186
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,840
And it's only like two hours or something like that by train, and so it's going to go

187
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
to Germany as well.

188
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
This is cool.

189
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
This is very cool.

190
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,640
Right now, I would say flying out of Heathrow or Gattwick is just not worth it.

191
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,440
You know, it's, yeah, I mean, sure, if you have to go to Finland, then you can't get

192
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,480
there by train easily, just yet.

193
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,840
Of course, the French and the Germans are striking.

194
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,000
So the German real workers of striking, I don't know if that affects the Euro star.

195
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,400
And the French, if it's Tuesday, of course, they're striking.

196
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
They always strike on Tuesday.

197
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,120
So they can get the maximum benefit of having the rest of the week off or almost as good

198
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,520
as the rest of the week off.

199
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,320
Speaking of strikes, New Story came out yesterday that the CBS news writers are now

200
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,560
having now approved a strike, which they would do to support the writers' guild of America

201
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,720
strike, which is going on there.

202
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,160
It's still going on in what it's third week now in California.

203
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,000
Let me see, I got the, it's a market watch story.

204
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,760
Let me see what I've got here.

205
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Yeah.

206
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,080
So here it comes.

207
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,520
CBS news writers voted to Spurn, CBS has contract offer in November of last year since

208
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,200
then the network has refused to put forth any new proposals.

209
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,520
It looks like they're going to go on strike.

210
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,200
And then, of course, there's the non-scripted drama, a better known as reality writers.

211
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,440
They aren't in the guild.

212
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,600
There is no guild for that.

213
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,720
So expect to see a lot more reality shows in the coming few weeks, because I don't believe

214
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,000
they're going to work this out.

215
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,400
In fact, I think it's very difficult to work out this writer's strike because, well, quite

216
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:56,960
honestly, it's very complicated to make money online with video.

217
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,880
No one's really making any, we're making money.

218
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,280
It's costing a lot still to do it, but look at YouTube, I don't even see any ads.

219
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,560
Let alone a few.

220
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,600
Just look at many other sites out there.

221
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,640
The no one is really making a lot of money.

222
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,040
And of course, if there's not a lot of money to be made, then there's no profit to be

223
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
divvyed out.

224
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,880
And of course, that's not what the writers are going for.

225
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,360
The writers are going for a piece of the gross proceeds, which is just, it's Hollywood.

226
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
It's the movie business.

227
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,000
You're never going to be able to figure that out.

228
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,960
I feel really bad for him.

229
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
I don't know.

230
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,280
I still like Jack Myers.

231
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,640
If you haven't ever seen Jack Myers column, he's a media analyst.

232
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,160
Jack Myers.com.

233
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,480
And his suggestion was that the advertiser should create a pool of money that should

234
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,160
be divvy out to the writers.

235
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,160
So any money that is spent on interactive advertising, instead of getting it from the

236
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,280
recipient of that money, which is the studios and the producers, he's suggesting, why not

237
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,720
do it at the source and just have, whatever the budgets are, whatever budgets any of these

238
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,600
agencies, who, of course, collect 15% agency commission over any media buy they do.

239
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,680
So it would technically come out of their pocket and not out of the advertisers, that

240
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,800
1% should go to this pool and that should be divvyed up amongst the writers.

241
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,680
But of course, there's a lot of other unions that will pop up, who also work on these and

242
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,320
probably don't get residuals either.

243
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
So tough.

244
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,760
I think that's called a conundrum.

245
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,680
I got this awesome email from, who do I get that from?

246
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,600
This is, man, this is almost something I want to hear this.

247
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,840
Of course, Alexander, he sent me a link and I'm going to post this in the show notes

248
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:53,680
of dailysourcecode.com of private contractors that have US government contracts in Iraq

249
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,680
and Afghanistan between 2004 and 2006.

250
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:03,920
This is essentially where our tax dollars are going to fight to terror in those regions.

251
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,440
And what's interesting is, and, you know, this, he has links to public integrity.org.

252
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,200
And at the top of the list, there's 20 billion, actually $20.4 billion going to unidentified

253
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
foreign entities.

254
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,080
So that's just $20 billion that is not identifiable as to what, what our money was spent

255
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
on.

256
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:30,040
Number two is KBR with $16 billion in two years time.

257
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,080
Of course, KBR formerly known as Kellogg Brown and Ruit, a fine halibut in subsidiary.

258
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:43,400
Then it's Dine Corp International through Veritas Capital with $1 billion, boy, it's a big

259
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
drop.

260
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
Washington Group International Inc.

261
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Another billion.

262
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,840
And then IAP Worldwide Services Inc, a division of service service, I guess, service capital

263
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
management.

264
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,840
This is, let me just see if there's any recognizable names, Blackwater USA, 485 million

265
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,640
Lockheed Martin, that mall makes sense, that's all.

266
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:17,920
What I'm not seeing, oh, Tyco International, Boeing Corp, Zapata Engineering, these are all

267
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,720
pretty new well-known companies.

268
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:28,360
I'm looking for, because when I was in Bosra in 2004, was that 2003 at the Air Base,

269
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,560
which, of course, has been, has been a lot of crap going on in Bosra in the past year.

270
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:39,320
It was a Burger King and was it a Burger King in a Pizza Hut or Macdonald?

271
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,480
No, I think it was a Burger King in a Pizza Hut.

272
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,640
So I'm wondering if they show up here, wouldn't that be funny?

273
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:52,640
This is only the top 100 with the number 100 company being ODB construction company,

274
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,640
receiving 8 million, oh, only a poultry, 8 million, oh, there's a fine Dutch company

275
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
there.

276
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,840
SHV Holdings and V, let's find out what they do.

277
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:11,000
Well, second, I'm going to go to this public integrity.org website, let's see, Defense Logistics

278
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:20,400
Agency, Contract SP0600411D, full and open competition after exclusion of sources.

279
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:28,880
They provide converters of the electrical non-rotating kind for $17 million, nice, nice job.

280
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,240
If you can get it, let's get into the spirit, shall we, since our government is giving

281
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,440
away all of our money, why don't we think about giving away some money in the form of

282
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:49,840
presence and think of the horror they see as in?

283
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,560
Bull hay, everyone, this is Ed Roberts from the Looking Out the Window Music podcast.

284
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,280
It's that time of the year, time to ring in the Christmas season, time to ring in another

285
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:06,240
season of Pods' Safe Christmas.

286
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,680

00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,200
tracks to get you into the Christmas season.

301
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:08,080
be here again, my friends, when we all gather around the fire, hope to find your sweetheart

302
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,200
of the mistletoe, it's Christmas, and we're wishing you a podsafe for you.

303
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,600
Mindy Smith, Santa will find you, I guess.

304
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:26,280
This is a crazy story that came across my spectrum this morning, there's now a drug that

305
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,840
lengthens eyelashes, this of course is what Revlon and others have been claiming for years

306
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,040
to be able to do with the pure mascara, which of course is horseshorshit and they even got

307
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:45,120
in trouble for using stick-on lashes, false eyelashes and the commercials, which of course

308
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,480
is something the lady Patricia has been calling out for years and years, but now there's

309
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:59,560
this glaucoma drug called Lumagon, Lumagon, I guess, and turns out that if you apply

310
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:05,800
this to your eyelashes, it actually makes your eyelashes grow longer.

311
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:12,960
So BIMA TOPROST is the active ingredient in Lumagon and others like it is a commonly

312
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,600
found in glaucoma drugs, it looks like mascara tube has a brush or tip for applying the product

313
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,920
along the base of the lashes and typically sells for $14260 in spas and doctors' offices.

314
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:32,160
So of course this is going to be a big news story because it's irrelevant, so be on the

315
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,920
lookout for it and it'll be top of the news everyone's going to be talking about it.

316
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Even though we're spending billions on commercial companies fighting a non-existent

317
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,840
and well not a non-existent, an invisible enemy, a poorly defined enemy, namely terror.

318
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Which is everywhere, it's on the roller coasters.

319
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm not in college today, that's all I can say.

320
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,840
Hey Adam, you're Germany.

321
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
Hey you?

322
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
Hope all as well.

323
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Yes.

324
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:07,840
It's been here to be 689 chilling out, nice couple herbal tea, if you know what I mean, and really enjoying

325
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
it.

326
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,840
I read this awesome book over the weekend.

327
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,840
You probably know when it's called Mr. Nice.

328
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
No, yeah.

329
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,840
It's written by Howard Knox and this guy's something else man.

330
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:25,840
I think he was one of the biggest smugglers of Mario Wana while back a couple years ago.

331
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,840
And he wrote this book in which he describes exactly how he smuggled and what he did to boost

332
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,840
the government and to get everything across the borders.

333
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Great book.

334
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
I really enjoyed reading it.

335
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,840
I think he's also definitely a red pill guy.

336
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,840
I go a little bit, but it seems that he's pretty open to doing some to do an interview.

337
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,840
So you might even get him on the other day in the source.

338
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
That would be really nice.

339
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
See you, bye.

340
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Yeah, interesting suggestion.

341
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,840
And I'm always looking for someone interesting to talk to on the Charlie.

342
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,840
I read the book, Mr. Nice, about Howard Marx, which was actually should have been my first clue

343
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,840
that my, one of my old business partners in Holland who later fled the country.

344
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:21,840
As it turned out, the name I'd known him under for eight years and his name known in business on large contracts was not his real name.

345
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,840
I fled to Cambodia of all places.

346
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,840
It turned out, I mean, it's a long, as a really stupid story.

347
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,840
Not a very happy ending to that one.

348
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
But he recommended I read this book.

349
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,840
And of course, Howard Marx, famous for smuggling huge quantities of mainly marijuana.

350
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,840
And later, ecstasy, I believe, as that started to gain popularity towards the end of his quote,

351
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
career.

352
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:54,840
They would smuggle it in cases for amplifiers with bands traveling around Europe.

353
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,840
And quite interesting, big companies that are behind all this.

354
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,840
You know, hundreds of millions of euros in this trade.

355
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,840
And yeah, it's like, it's an interesting book.

356
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,840
It's maybe a bit of a glorification of the drug smuggling trade.

357
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,840
Yeah, he's a red pill, but I don't know.

358
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
I just don't find the story that interesting.

359
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,840
But it is a good read for sure.

360
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,840
If you want to know more about smuggling drugs,

361
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
I can't miss their nice.

362
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
Ah, you know what?

363
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,840
I'll put a link in the show notes to the book at Amazon.com.

364
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
So you can buy that.

365
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
I also grew a year older over the weekend.

366
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Or it felt like 10 years older.

367
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
My daughter started her first driving lesson ever.

368
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Oh, yeah, boy.

369
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Of course, they don't have drivers at here in Europe or in the UK.

370
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,840
So it's not quite like the States where, you know, 15 or 16.

371
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
They're already taken drivers at.

372
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
And it's kind of a part of the schooling process.

373
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
And here it's a separate deal.

374
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
She had a great lesson, though.

375
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
She said she's really well.

376
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,840
She used to drive the tractor when she was a 10 or 11.

377
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
10, 11, 12.

378
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,840
No, when she was more like, yeah, 12, 12, 13.

379
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,840
When we had the castle, we had a little mini tractor, which is cool.

380
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
And she was good.

381
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
She could do the clutch and shift and all that.

382
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
So, you know, she's got a lot of that baked in.

383
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
But still, just kind of makes you feel like, oh, you know, crab.

384
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Get old.

385
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Hey, Adam.

386
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Alan, person's also here.

387
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Okay.

388
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
Now it's just on my way home.

389
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
Listen to my agenda.

390
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Got to say, together, PG6.

391
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
You've got to be drinking.

392
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
You'll succeed.

393
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,840
It's got to be the best thing we could get in the UK.

394
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Anyway, try it out.

395
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Well, follow the rectal.

396
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
Okay.

397
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Yep.

398
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Cheers.

399
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
Well, let's end reference to the conversation.

400
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,840
I have with John C. Dvorak on no agenda.

401
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Talking about what's the real.

402
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
I didn't know that he was a big tea guy.

403
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,840
He's just a, anything you can put in your mouth.

404
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
He's into.

405
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Yes, that too.

406
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
I'm sure.

407
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
The wine food, tea coffees.

408
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
He loves it all.

409
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,840
And I was saying that, you know, we typically drink PG tips.

410
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
But this Yorkshire stuff.

411
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
Okay.

412
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
I'll try that out.

413
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,840
I presume I can get that at Sainsbury's, which is where we shop.

414
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
All right.

415
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Well, you know what?

416
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
I'm just going to really slow.

417
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,840
You know, have you ever had those moments where you just like to stop the world?

418
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,840
I think these moments are important, by the way, because we go so fast.

419
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
We're whirling around through the universe.

420
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,840
But hundreds of thousands of miles an hour, we're sending our bits, you know,

421
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,840
in packet form across the, the interwebs on an hourly minute, second basis.

422
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Sometimes you're just going to slow everything down and just say,

423
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:39,840
I need to stop, stop the world, slow down, relax, and listen to a piece of music

424
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,840
from the soundtrack to my life.

425
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Thank you.

426
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
Thank you.

427
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Thank you.

428
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Thank you.

429
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Thank you.

430
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
Thank you.

431
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
Thank you.

432
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Thank you.

433
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Thank you.

434
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Thank you.
