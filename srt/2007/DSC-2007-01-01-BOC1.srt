And let the fabulous show begin.

7

It's Adam and Patricia.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes, Adam and Patricia.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Adam and Lady Patricia.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Are you doing everybody?

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's Marcus Couch.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Welcome to the best of the daily source code.

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Please, to be your host today.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm the regular host of Pod Show Music Rewind.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But right now, I'd like to bring in my better half.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
My wife Barbara, how are you doing Barbara?

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I think you are you.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm good. I'm sitting right next to you here.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm so excited.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes, you should be. It's a great honor to be hosting the best of the daily source code.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's explain the music underneath us, shall we?

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is Zorba. What is this? Zorba's dance?

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What is this?

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Absolutely. Let's dance, Zorba.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
My Greek wife.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Any of you guys seen my big fat Greek wedding?

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Zorba.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That is the life of me to a team.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Everything is all Greek all the time.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's like a cultural radio station that just never leaves your earbuds.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Fantastic.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You know, Patricia is also, I think, at least half Greek, according to Adam.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Correct?

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, she is.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Dekani's breakfast is here. He's the Kalao.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, bye.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm going to call up some man.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Exactly. That's what I said.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Only more pointy.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You know, it's special.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So, we're going to be featuring clips of Adam and Patricia from the daily source code.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hope and everybody's having a great new year out there.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How was New Year's Eve for you? Really good?

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, it was so much fun. So much fun.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I cannot help it. Let's dance.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, right. Let's do it.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, O6 was a banner year in the Kouch Household.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We moved to California. We had a really great time.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Man, it's time to get to work, though. It's O7.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What do you say? Should we get to work?

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's get to work now. I'm breaking the dishes right now.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No, don't break the day. I said no.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No, you can't do that. We got to break the show.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's our dishes.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, there goes my award. There's a trophy.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, stop.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No, no, no, no.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You better put that down. Put that down.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There. Stop.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Wait, what are we going to eat off of?

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We just got here to California.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We're not going to have anything to eat with.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Hey.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Here's the show.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hey, baby, how you doing? It's Friday.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, it's Friday, finally.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It is. I was so tired a whole week.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, well, we went to bed every night at 130.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What do you expect?

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What's the matter with your curves? You don't want to go to bed.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You don't seem to understand.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You never hear me complain about being tired.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Even though I'm tired.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're young. You're still young.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, thank you.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But I was your age.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I wasn't tired.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I know, but why don't you just go to bed?

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You don't have to wait up.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Just go to bed all right.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No, I have to because I'm afraid that you guys

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
leave the candles burning.

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, honey.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I have an entire condo in San Francisco,

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
which is still as far as I know,

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
has not burned down yet.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, but.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And I've got candles.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I do lock the doors.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It has a door.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Excuse me.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't have a reason why you stay up because you're afraid

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
that we're going to leave the candles burning.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I do not.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I do not leave the door.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The refrigerator open.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's your daughter.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Stop it.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, you really get me riled up when you do this shit.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't be blaming me for like the fridge door of that crappy ass.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How can you even call it a fridge?

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's true.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's not even a fridge.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's like a cupboard.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So, did you hear me laugh?

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Start laughing when you get angry.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Start laughing.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You know, laughing.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Honey, girlfriend, you have not seen me angry.

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You have not seen the devil come out of me because the devil in me is wearing

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Prada.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So, I'll avoid you establish.

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't leave the refrigerator door open.

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But, okay.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So, I leave the.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So, the refrigerator door.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm not really open, but you have to close.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Close it.

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Look, give me a checklist.

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm good at checklist.

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I have to do this before I go flying.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Give me a checklist.

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And then then you'll know.

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And then I'll even check it off on the piece of paper.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So, and in the morning, you can get up and you can see that I did the checklist.

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay.

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So, it's the refrigerator door.

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No candles.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Lock all doors.

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's the garden door.

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Three things.

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Three.

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do it.

144
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I want you to have the rest you need as an older woman.

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So, okay.

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What else?

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Now, you know.

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's it.

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Exactly.

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And just to know that you guys are still walking around through the house.

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And, you know, you need somebody to just say, okay, guys.

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, okay.

153
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
All right.

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, it is something totally different.

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah.

156
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I can't sleep when I know other people are still awake.

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But the other people are your husband and daughter.

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You know, we're fine.

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The other people's in that.

160
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But we're fine.

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's so unfair for you to blame us that you are tired.

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You can go to bed whenever you want.

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't think it's that.

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's just getting up.

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Did you bring your tea?

166
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No.

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Where's my tea?

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I've made it for you downstairs.

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Put it on the counter.

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What's the matter with you?

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because you were late.

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And you're pretending like, oh, whatever.

173
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Do a show.

174
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Because you were late.

175
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And I made tea for you.

176
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay.

177
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Of all the things we discussed Wednesday on the show.

178
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I already told you this.

179
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What was the number one thing everyone caught on to and called in about.

180
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, the folder in the folder or scruncher.

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You will not believe the things people are interested in.

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

183
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And think it's important.

184
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Check it out.

185
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hi, Adam.

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This is Jen from bucket at bucketpotcast.com.

187
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I was just listening to Charlie and listening to your conversation about

188
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
punching versus folding.

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And I have to say, I was not the burning question about toilet paper.

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Was whether you put the roll on so that it feeds from over or from under.

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There's an argument in my house at least.

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And I don't know which is a different between men and women.

193
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The over and under thing.

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Or maybe a fat regional whatever.

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm totally over by the way.

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I'm a scruncher.

197
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hi.

198
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah, I'd need to see.

199
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm a scruncher.

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah.

201
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I need to be over.

202
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You know.

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I totally agree.

204
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It has to be over the roll on there.

205
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah.

206
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Otherwise, it could, it's own, it's own through gravity.

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's own weight could unroll the entire roll.

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I've seen that.

209
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah.

210
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I agree.

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And hotels always do it like that.

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So there must be a rule for it.

213
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I like it over with little point in it.

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And I think that ladies are more folders because of the scruncher.

215
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yes.

216
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But most of them are, I think, folders because we're more sensitive there.

217
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Dude, I'm a folder.

218
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But you're sensitive.

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, yeah.

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're so sensitive.

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah.

222
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's, you know, there's something else that, you know, that always seems to be a point of discussion is men don't put the toilet seat down.

223
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah.

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I think I'm a very simple solution to this controversy.

225
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why don't, why doesn't everybody agree that when you're done with the toilet, you put the lid down.

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah.

227
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I think women should also put the lid down.

228
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I think there's nothing on this go.

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And the, and the, the real lid.

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's what I mean.

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Just everything.

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So that way everybody does some work.

233
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So it's not like women don't have to do anything.

234
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But I see lots of women who complain about,

235
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
not men not putting the seat back down.

236
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah.

237
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I hate it too.

238
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's just like a big, like, you're here.

239
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Did you hear that?

240
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Ready for you.

241
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Did you read about,

242
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
there's a McDonald's that opened up in Holland.

243
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And of course, McDonald's is a franchise with the American company comes and checks it out.

244
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And he had two of those urinals, the ones that,

245
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the modern art urinals that look like a big, big mouth with big red lips.

246
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

247
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And the American said you can't have that yet to take it out.

248
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, I mean, it is kind of like putting your dick in a mouth.

249
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I mean, let's begin with that.

250
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's joke.

251
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Uh-huh.

252
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, but that's no human.

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, there's no humor in the McDonald's corporation when it comes to that.

254
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But the the only thing they have on their mind in an, in America.

255
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Correct.

256
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
How come they didn't like it?

257
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Uh-huh.

258
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Uh-huh.

259
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
See?

260
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Uh-huh.

261
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So we have scrunchers and we have folders and we have another category.

262
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, yes.

263
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh.

264
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hey, Adam.

265
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's a function to start with all the podcast.

266
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And I, uh, we're just going to like to weigh in on the scrunching versus folding.

267
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And I'm the roller.

268
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Uh, let's figure that one out.

269
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
A roller.

270
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But the hell?

271
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,520
You say night change

272
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah.

273
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,040
Night change

274
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,360
I feel the same as before

275
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,000
I thank your scared

276
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,040
Yeah, that's it.

277
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,960
Would you cast more

278
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,040
Student matters

279
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,000
Stop, sis.

280
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,920
You are the stars

281
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
That's it.

282
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
See there.

283
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
All you would ever give me.

284
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
See there.

285
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Pull around and then we'll ever.

286
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
You'll never give away.

287
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Pull around and then we'll ever.

288
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,920
You'll never give away.

289
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,920
You'll never give away.

290
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Can't dance.

291
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
Late night.

292
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
It's time to fall.

293
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
It's in the sky.

294
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
It's back.

295
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
It's back.

296
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
It's the day.

297
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
It's the day.

298
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Let's time with you.

299
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Let us be there.

300
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Only you know what I'm saying.

301
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,920
I don't believe it's like someone else.

302
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Maybe you're before.

303
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,920
All around and then we'll ever.

304
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
You'll never give away.

305
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
You'll never give away.

306
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,920
You'll never give away.

307
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,920
You'll never give away.

308
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,920
You'll never give away.

309
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Let's go.

310
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:18,920
You saved me by change, I feel the same as before, I think you're scared, and that this isn't what you meant for.

311
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Only when I sheltered, I feel like someone else made it before.

312
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:40,920
All around the field and the love, all of them get on and go, all around the field and the love.

313
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,920
They all make it on and go.

314
00:12:43,920 --> 00:13:03,920
That's holding Mercury, lead singer and guitarist Matt Hopper, and Matt's from Chicago.

315
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,920
He was also one of the finalists in Rockstar Supernova.

316
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,920
He might have heard that on Rock and Roll Geat Show with Michael Butler, but Barbara, you and I've actually met Matt Hopper before.

317
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
He's a kind gentleman.

318
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Yes, he's a kind Chicago boy, and it sucks that he didn't get to be the lead singer of Supernova,

319
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,920
but I'm sure Matt's going to go on to better and brighter things, and I know he's also good pals with Grainian,

320
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,920
from the Pod Safe Music Network.

321
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
You also met Grainian, didn't you, Barbara?

322
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Yes, I did, Grainian is wonderful guy, happy and compassionate.

323
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Yes, we've met several members of his family, really great people, and it's a really great thing that they're putting

324
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,920
herself on the Pod Safe Music Network, so to all you artists listening out there, happy new year to you,

325
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,920
much success and prosperity in 2007.

326
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,920
All right, we're going to get back to the clips here. This is the best of Charlie, Adam and Patricia.

327
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
So you know little Britain.

328
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Yeah.

329
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,920
And lots of people who listen to the show, probably watch it in America as well.

330
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Great enough.

331
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,920
So what is one of your favorite female characters on Little Britain?

332
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,920
I'm just, there could be a couple of, maybe, or maybe one of them, or one, okay.

333
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
I'm a lady, that one and...

334
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
No, no, that's...

335
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm a lady, you see, no, no.

336
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Okay, listen to this, no listen to this.

337
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Graham Wilson sent this in, listen to it.

338
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,920
Hi Peter, it's Linda.

339
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,920
I have a presenter with me once to know if he can miss the satellite window.

340
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
It's Adam Curry.

341
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Oh, you know Adam, long blonde hair, slightly vacant look.

342
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,920
Long legs.

343
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Like to have sex with pies.

344
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Virtual penis.

345
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,920
Never actually met in if his friends.

346
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,920
What all of Bon Jovis old haircuts at a charity location?

347
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,920
That's right, the big head fag.

348
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Okay, I'll tell him.

349
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,920
Peter upset that you can miss the satellite window, but he'll have to do that Florida cop thing.

350
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,920
And beat you to death with a baton.

351
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
I'm good as that man.

352
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Hello, it's Linda.

353
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,920
So there's Linda character, she's an administrator at a school.

354
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,920
And people, you know, kids keep walking in that are all different ethnicities and visual.

355
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
And they're asking features.

356
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
Right, she always calls and then insults them.

357
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
She's on the phone and exactly that man.

358
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
They crack me up.

359
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
I love that.

360
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Thank you, dude.

361
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
I have so-and-so in front of me.

362
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
And then she starts.

363
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,920
All right, Marcus Couch and Barbra Couch.

364
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,920
The lovely Barbra Couch joining us here on the best of Charlie, Adam and Patricia Edition.

365
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
So how you hold that so far?

366
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,920
This is pretty much the longest podcast you've ever been on, huh?

367
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
Yes, they can.

368
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
But I love it.

369
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Right here.

370
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
You're already tired of it.

371
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
No.

372
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
We're holding a microphone.

373
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Yeah.

374
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
Yeah, that's right.

375
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Hey, what's up everybody on the serious window.

376
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,920
You can check me out on the weekend rocking you out on the scenes scene.

377
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
Thanks for the segue, dear.

378
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,920
And if you like to find out more about my show, you can go to the scenes scene.com.

379
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,920
And also, we've got Pot Show Music Rewind, which is at rewind.potshow.com.

380
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,920
And rewind is my baby.

381
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,920
That's something that I really enjoy producing.

382
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,920
It's where we take about five or six music podcaster clips that they submit to me.

383
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
And we kind of mix and match them all up.

384
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,920
And it's a show that I never know how it's going to sound.

385
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
You know what I'm putting it together.

386
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,920
And it always comes out with a really special plan.

387
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
Much like Greek baccala.

388
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
Uh-huh.

389
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,920
I don't forget Aily's first or the time.

390
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
They're listening to the daily source code.

391
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
He doesn't need a blog.

392
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
It's Adam.

393
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
He doesn't need a blog.

394
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Well, we've got something coming up here that Adam read a letter that I wrote to him to Patricia.

395
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,920
And it's really a great story.

396
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,920
And it's just something that came through for us.

397
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Podcasting actually got us from the dreary depths of Chicago, Illinois, to the sunny shores of Orange County, California.

398
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,920
And I'm still doing backflips.

399
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,920
I totally appreciate everything that everybody had Pot Show's doing.

400
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,920
Not just Adam and Ron and everybody else, but you know the developers, all the guys who were testing the stuff.

401
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,920
You know, C.C. Chapman, the guy who let me in the door, to Christopher Shears, the guy who's doing the pot safe music network.

402
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Man, you guys all rock.

403
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,920
And I got to thank you for everything that you've done and made possible for me and my lovely bride here.

404
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Thank you so much.

405
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
Yes.

406
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Thank you so much.

407
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:56,920
And well, my thanks continues here as Adam reads a letter that I wrote him.

408
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,920
I think it was June and when he read it, I hadn't quit my job yet.

409
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:08,920
So I was a little taken up back by hearing it on the source code, but nonetheless, we can all look back at it now and enjoy it for what it was.

410
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Yeah.

411
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Yes.

412
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Thank you Adam.

413
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:18,920
So I thought it would be particularly nice in conjunction with this email message that I got from Marcus Couch from this scenes scene.

414
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,920
He does is a and the pod, pod set music rewind.

415
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,920
So he's a pod show network podcast.

416
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Yeah.

417
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
And so he sent the private email to me.

418
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
I'm just going to read a little piece because it really touched me.

419
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
I really like it.

420
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Thanks again for the video cast plug.

421
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
I received great positive feedback.

422
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,920
I'm quitting my day job of six years and moving to Orange County, California on July 31st.

423
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,920
The compensation I've received from Pod show has enabled the opportunity for my wife and I to make the move.

424
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Her son and nephew are there and the move will bring us all together again.

425
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,920
We really appreciate everything you and Pod show provided us and I can't thank you enough.

426
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Ah.

427
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
Isn't that beautiful?

428
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,920
That's beautiful.

429
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,920
And it's not like we, I mean, this is just based upon his own creativity and performance.

430
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
Yeah.

431
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:07,920
And anyone who signs up because, you know, we're about to unleash if anyone knows you know.

432
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
So that anyone can do this.

433
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,920
And here's a guy who actually made it happen.

434
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
I mean, I just love it.

435
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
That's what you want to do.

436
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Exactly.

437
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
And I'm just like, I read and there's more.

438
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
There's a whole bunch more to it.

439
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,920
But remember, you told that that story on TV in Holland and everybody laughed.

440
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Oh, that I said, everyone will have their own brought in the transmitter.

441
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Yes.

442
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Oh, yeah, they all laughed.

443
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
They all laughed.

444
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
They all laughed.

445
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
And then through he said it.

446
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Ha ha ha.

447
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,920
Who's got the last laugh now?

448
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,920
And that's going to wrap it up for this past of Charlie Adam and Patricia Edition.

449
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,920
My name is Marcus Couch and Barbara Couch.

450
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Thanks for listening.

451
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Take care, everybody.

452
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Bye.

453
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Bye.

454
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:58,920
So I searched for my place in this world.

455
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,920
I know I've got limited time to be heard.

456
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,920
People keep telling me, I've got to do this while I'm young.

457
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,920
This when I get older all my energy will be gone.

458
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:24,920
It's so a try to keep my head clear.

459
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,920
I still fuck up sometimes when you're not here.

460
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:37,920
I smoke so much that I forget my goals.

461
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:44,920
And now I know what it feels like when time takes its toll.

462
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:51,920
I'm so have a dream for too long.

463
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Should I move along?

464
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:04,920
I'll keep on pushing on when you can never dream for too long.

465
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Just keep your focus on reaching the stars, oh yeah.

466
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:25,920
So I said I'm not right about life.

467
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,920
And what I'd be like if you were my wife.

468
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,920
I'm so lost on real true way to go.

469
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:46,920
And so I disappear and let you think control.

470
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm so have a dream for too long.

471
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Should I move along?

472
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:06,920
I'll keep on pushing on when you can never dream for too long.

473
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Just keep your focus on reaching the stars, oh yeah.

474
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:48,920
So now that I've thought this all out, I'm much more confident but still have my dad.

475
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:58,920
I'll lift my head back up to the sky.

476
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:07,920
I'll hold on to where I die.

477
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,920
So I have a dream for too long.

478
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Should I move along?

479
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:27,920
I'll keep on pushing on when you can never dream for too long.

480
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:34,920
But still keep your focus on reaching the stars, oh yeah.

481
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:44,920
So now that I've thought this all out, I'm much more confident but still have my dad.

482
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:52,920
So now that I've thought this all out, I'm much more confident but still have my dad.

483
00:23:52,920 --> 00:24:03,920
So now that I've thought this all out, I'm much more confident but still have my dad.
