00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to the Daily Source Codes 630.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:21,400
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, we're

4
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,880
and even if you're a sleepy Christie's fool,

5
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,440
it's a bad of a curry.

6
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,660
Cool.

7
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,520
You guys are beautiful.

8
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Okay, we'll be here.

9
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Yeah.

10
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
I saw stars around.

11
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,400
They had a power green steam here from New York, and I wanted it to just thank you for

12
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,400
D.K.S. like or what a lot of us hope it would be like.

13
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Watch it for one slide, the family stone, soundtrack to our live.

14
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Every day people are surely.

15
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Thanks a lot.

16
00:02:49,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Some people go on slow breaks.

17
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
How do you do?

18
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,400
How are we?

19
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Nothing's wrong but it's alright.

20
00:03:49,400 --> 00:04:08,400
You know, how about your shoulders that you don't want to be environmentally conscious,

21
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
because it's a really tricky thing to do.

22
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,400
I'm just hoping that they can cope with some newer way of fueling things and cleaner ways of doing things.

23
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Because we do the usual things like carbon neutralizing and stuff like that.

24
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
You know, all the flights and all the transport.

25
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
But I don't think it's enough.

26
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
I think there's a lot more we could do.

27
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
You know, there's still a lot of waste.

28
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,400
And in both we've been here today's kind of helping and making a point.

29
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,400
And hopefully more people will pay attention and get part of the course.

30
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Thank you very much indeed for coming to join us today.

31
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Enjoy the rest of live Earth.

32
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
But here we'll leave Jonathan.

33
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
There you go. That was it. It's down there with Damien David.

34
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
I'm joined here with the Danish and Germany.

35
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
It was for weeks, which I can't possibly explain to you.

36
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
But it's lovely to have you both here.

37
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Why not if you win the same hat as Jack Osball?

38
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
It's lovely.

39
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
I started off.

40
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
No, they were good on sale.

41
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Oh, price outside.

42
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
So I picked one up.

43
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Let's go to get one.

44
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
But he couldn't carry it off.

45
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Why is he selling them outside?

46
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Yeah, I think they made it of hemp.

47
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Which is a natural fabric and fiber we should be using.

48
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
I'm going to try it on too.

49
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
How you enjoying the concert so far today?

50
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Yeah, it's brilliant.

51
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Yeah, it's great.

52
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
It's great.

53
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
It's a nice and best music for yourself.

54
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
I enjoyed racing life.

55
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
I thought there was no photographer or fantastic.

56
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
And I'm very much looking forward to saving it.

57
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
I think they might be coming up next.

58
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
I think they might be coming up next.

59
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
I think they might be coming up next.

60
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Genesis was great.

61
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Genesis is really good.

62
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Really good.

63
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Well, it was at its last time.

64
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
It's like a guilty pleasure sometimes.

65
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
It's nice to see they're still alive.

66
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
If they find out what that was, it's nice to see it.

67
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
I've got some energy as well.

68
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Lots of energy.

69
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
It's better than their age.

70
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
You're going to say that.

71
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Let me ask you.

72
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Have you turned off all your appliances before coming out today?

73
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Yes.

74
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Absolutely.

75
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Everything.

76
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
I left the house and you were on the radio.

77
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
When I switched off?

78
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Yes.

79
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
You normally do it.

80
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Really.

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Really.

82
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
But it is genuinely, it is wowing.

83
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
It is.

84
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
It is.

85
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
You know, what's so weird?

86
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
I find out.

87
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
I don't know if you're the movie.

88
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
We kind of have none about this for quite a long while.

89
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Yeah.

90
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
And it's only now that it's getting to a real, almost the crisis point.

91
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
We're getting to do anything about it.

92
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Yeah.

93
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
We don't speak well in human rights.

94
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
It's quite worrying.

95
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,400
We went out to do a marathon in Kenya for the saving planet Earth, which is on Monday,

96
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
running wild on BBC.

97
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
So that's why you're here.

98
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
That's why we're here.

99
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I think we're just free loading.

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Yeah.

101
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
We've actually done something like that.

102
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
We've actually done something like that.

103
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
We've actually done something like that.

104
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
We've actually done something like that.

105
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,400
We went out and did a marathon between five of us.

106
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,400
John Colchore, Kelly Find Liberty X.

107
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Well, he did the big bit.

108
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
He did the eight Mars.

109
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
How did three and a half.

110
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
You know, the better legs.

111
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Someone hunky.

112
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Yeah.

113
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
It made us realise.

114
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
You know, I've fed a baby Rhino.

115
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
And you realise that this...

116
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Hold on.

117
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
You brushed fed a baby Rhino.

118
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,400
No, I can't say that on the series.

119
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
I think you love formula milk.

120
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
I gave this baby.

121
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Low, low.

122
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
And he fed a baby Rhino.

123
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
It made it really.

124
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
It's got a switch off his point.

125
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Got a switch off my point.

126
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Well, if let's then let's go out and feed a baby Rhino for the future of mankind.

127
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Then why can't we turn off our TV?

128
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
It does happen to the two.

129
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
That's our table.

130
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
And what about your baby Rhino?

131
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
There's a baby Rhino that to keep your chance, so he reads his name.

132
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
He says that's right and it's all that I've written.

133
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
I make quite a good point.

134
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
I thought I'd hurt him.

135
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
You know, you get...

136
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
No, I really don't know what I did.

137
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
You know, am I?

138
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Yes.

139
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
When you say good-up?

140
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
No, you know, am I?

141
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
When you say good-up?

142
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Why can't they give you an oxygen to offset your am I was to plant trees instead of flying more?

143
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Greenmile?

144
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Yeah, is instead of encouraging you to fly more.

145
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
The Greenmile was to do with death blow.

146
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
What?

147
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
It was a curse.

148
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
It was a good movie.

149
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,560
Good idea that actually penalize what they instead of animals that take them away from us

150
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Look at him with his saintly glow just because he fed a baby wine out

151
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,920
Right save the rhino, please, happy with the friend the rhino

152
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
Did you cladal it?

153
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
45 days old, it was quite big

154
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Blimey, did I have a hole yet?

155
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,760
No, it did after he was feeding it

156
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
He gave you

157
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,240
He wasn't feeding it, he wasn't feeding it

158
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,480
If you've got a baby wine out of me, please send it into the list and it's he knows how to nurse them

159
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,280
Well, I'm bad you guys got off your backside, so this I feel bad now that I haven't won a

160
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm going to turn everything off when I go home and leave it off for as long as possible

161
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,800
But genuinely I'm hoping the message gets across you think of these kind of events can change things

162
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
You think people do change their mind?

163
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
I just think about it

164
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,520
I think I can enjoy it as well enjoy the entertainment

165
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,960
I think they do, I honestly I have not been the greenest person

166
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,000
I have actually now started switching things up and started recycling

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,800
I know it's taken up to this point for me to do it by our machine site

168
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
She even can borrow your house

169
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,480
Nice to meet you guys

170
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,640
The total night, but I'm afraid it would probably get worse

171
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,680
We're going to go out now alive because just about to start on the stage

172
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,280
And we've all been looking forward to this

173
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,280
I know one of the best fans around at the moment

174
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
I think they're just about to come on right now

175
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,040
It is the fabulous

176
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
Cassibian

177
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Thank you

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,900
Stop

188
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,300
There's only one way to Nova

189
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,900
You walk autowash away

190
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:18,900
One, two, one, two, one, two.

191
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Check one, two, one, two.

192
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Don't bless you.

193
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:31,900
One, two, one, two, one.

194
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:16,900
I just want to address the whole world where we want to save your energy.

Come on, two, one, two, one.

206
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:23,900
Welcome to the Daily Source Codes 630, where you're here.

207
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,900
All kinds of commentary, stories, savants.

208
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
And of course, it's Fubar Friday.

209
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,900
So what better way than to kick it off with some great Friday Fubar music?

210
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:47,900
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, three.

211
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Or something else.

212
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,900
Here's the DSC 630.

213
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,900
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

214
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,900
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

215
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,900
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

216
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,900
Fantastic DSC Battle Curry!

217
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:22,900
What ever low wants?

218
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Love again.

219
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:33,900
And the man, the low wants you.

220
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Pick up your mind to hand.

221
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,900
Low regrets.

222
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:49,900
Be glad yourself, enjoy yourself, you're through.

223
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:57,900
I always get what I aim for.

224
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,900
And your heart, I'm so...

225
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,900
Is what I care for.

226
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,900
But ever low wants.

227
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,900
Don't be bad, don't be weak.

228
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
No again.

229
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Don't get wrong.

230
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Some take off your phone.

231
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,900
Don't you know who can do it.

232
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,900
Don't be bad, don't be weak.

233
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
It's never more.

234
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,900
You're no exception to the room.

235
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,900
I'm here as it's the better you feel.

236
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,900
I'm here as it's the better you feel.

237
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,900
I'm here as it's the better you feel.

238
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,900
I'm here as it's the better you feel.

239
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,900
I'm here as it's the better you feel.

240
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,900
I'm here as it's the better you feel.

241
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,900
I always get what I aim for.

242
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,900
But ever low wants.

243
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,900
You're no person.

244
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Don't you know who can do it.

245
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:36,900
I'm here as this, never you feel me.

246
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
Hmm.

247
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,900
I'll need D.J. Redworm could make a Saturday morning sound just right.

248
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Sarah Vaughn and Nellie Frutato featuring Tim Bolan with the Primiscuous and whatever

249
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,900
Lola wants mashed up into Primiscuous Lola.

250
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,900
What are you doing daily source code?

251
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
630.

252
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,900
It's kind of weird show because I missed Fubar Friday, although it's still Friday somewhere

253
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
I believe.

254
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,900
And maybe it has crap.

255
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,900
So we're going to try and do a, let's see.

256
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,900
We're going to do a show with the attitude of a Fubar, but with the chilled out

257
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Meloness of, you know, like a Saturday morning kind of.

258
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,900
Beautiful weather outside here outside of the curry manner.

259
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,900
And today is the 7th of July 2007, which means live birthday.

260
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,900
And of course we have a direct satellite connection to that, so we'll see what's going on.

261
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,900
And maximum music.

262
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,900
I saw stars around your feet once.

263
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,900
Little lights like fish you swim in.

264
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,900
Took off your high turn, your chin, and time stood still.

265
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:50,900
And I said, Mark, space, we walked up in the hills of times.

266
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Like this sometimes, like those we felt that he'd have all yearns.

267
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:06,900
I feel my head and spill my tears in one time.

268
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,900
In one time, in one time.

269
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:18,900
In one time, I will see.

270
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:27,900
In one time, in one time.

271
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:34,900
In one time, I will see.

272
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:54,900
I saw time around your feet once.

273
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,900
Little seas that blink and shimmer.

274
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,900
Throwing on more cold hearts.

275
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,900
You need your mark and take your place.

276
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:15,900
In one time, in one time.

277
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:22,900
In one time, I will see.

278
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:31,900
In one time, in one time.

279
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:38,900
In one time, I will see.

280
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:46,900
In one time, in one time.

281
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:55,900
In one time, in one time.

282
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:10,900
In one time, in one time.

283
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:19,900
In one time, in one time.

284
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:26,900
In one time, I will see.

285
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:35,900
In one time, in one time.

286
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:42,900
In one time, I will see.

287
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,900
I saw time around your feet once.

288
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,900
Little seas that blink and shimmer.

289
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,900
Throwing on more cold hearts.

290
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,900
In one time, in one time.

291
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,900
In one time, in one time.

292
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:08,900
In one time, in one time.

293
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:19,900
In one time.

294
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:26,900
In one time.

295
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:36,620
I think 2004, maybe it is certainly 2005, let me see, where is it, 46-plus?

296
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:42,260
You can tell what I did is, yeah, July 19, 2005 was added to the podcast music network.

297
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,980
You can tell that I've gone back to my songs played, I have like 28 pages of songs that

298
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,860
I've played that I can review on, the PMman is pretty cool.

299
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,340
So I should probably step back to Thursday night because that's the last time, actually

300
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,420
we spoke just before Christina and I left to go to see the Justin Timberlake show and of

301
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:07,300
course, thanks to the folks at Virgin Atlantic Marketing and the personal account management

302
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:14,980
services for hooking us up with the tickets in a sweet no less at the O2 venue, formerly known

303
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,980
as the Millennium Dome.

304
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,700
I'd never been in there, it was great.

305
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:24,740
Great show, Fergie was on first, Timberlake actually did a set in between two sets of

306
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:30,020
Timberlake, it was a pretty good show, I got a little tired at the end of basically watching

307
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:36,020
a music video on stage, but it was good, JT, as we call him.

308
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:42,020
JT, yeah, he's a real musician, man, and he's got a band, he respects the band, it was actually

309
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,220
really nice at the end, he brought everyone up on stage, all the dancers, they all took

310
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,740
a bow, you know, it wasn't your typical good night and come back for an encore and then

311
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,060
leave and speed off in the limo as much more personal than that and sound was pretty good

312
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,060
for that venue too.

313
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,660
And of course, the most fun was hanging out with Christina, which was really the entire

314
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,100
point Friday.

315
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:08,260
So a lot of work went into Friday in preparing for a company wide football, where

316
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:14,700
we were laying out strategy of the company, strategy of some of our products, introducing

317
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,700
each other to what we do because we're now probably about 125 strong, so there's about

318
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,780
100 people in San Francisco and the rest of the company gathered by a web ex, which by the

319
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,380
way, I hadn't used web ex in a while, damn, that's how I'm going to do all my meetings

320
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,380
from now on.

321
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:38,540
They got phone bridges that tie in, the video was fantastic, they've got chats, sharing

322
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,740
of documents, really, although that part we fucked up, we didn't get the PowerPoint

323
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,740
working.

324
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,300
And I actually created a little video for everybody, you know, because I wanted a little

325
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,620
different impact than just the web ex video and put a link on curry.com, you can find

326
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:57,260
the football channel that I put together, a lot of the episodes that we watched together.

327
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:04,380
And so that really started 11 a.m. San Francisco time, at 11, 20, my video file had finally

328
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,460
uploaded, so we'd already started and of course I couldn't get on web ex while I was

329
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,900
doing the upload because I wanted to conserve the bandwidth.

330
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,700
And that took us up to about 10 o'clock and I was fucking wiped, I'm sorry, I had already

331
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,940
had a lot of songs and I just couldn't pull it together, I was so incredibly tired and I

332
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,260
knew Christina was going to have to get up early because there's she's off to a place called

333
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:30,940
new key, or as I hear him say, new key in Cornwall.

334
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:37,100
And this apparently is a tradition, at least a recent tradition where after the primary grade

335
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:43,100
school and all through, you know, up until the sixth form, and now everyone's going off to

336
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:51,580
different schools as kind of like a final hurrah, the kids all go off to this, it's like a holiday

337
00:26:51,580 --> 00:27:00,860
trailer park camp. And there's no real adult supervision, of course there are rules within the camp,

338
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:07,980
but it's kind of like, yeah, one parent who I like Simon this guy that rocks his dad,

339
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,380
he said, you know, it's kind of like safety by numbers, you know, you got a couple hundred these

340
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,820
kids and it seems to work itself out. You know, there is, there is someone who can kick some

341
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,660
ass at the, at this holiday camp park, if need be, but apparently things go reasonably well.

342
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,580
So it's, it's weird though, it's hard, it's hard to wave to your daughter and another she's gone

343
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,060
gone for a week. Oh, although I know Patricia now I'm going to have a lot of fun.

344
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:41,740
Let's see, um, so let me just check our satellite connection here. Yes, okay, the satellite connection

345
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,940
with the BBC is working, live Earth is taking place today, Cassabian that was just on stage.

346
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,460
And I've got to tell you, I have, I'm a little conflicted by this. Now first of all,

347
00:27:52,460 --> 00:28:00,460
obviously, the idea that we can, um, raise awareness for protecting our planet, absolutely.

348
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,900
The whole idea of save the Earth because it's falling apart and going to implode and, you know,

349
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:14,380
we're killing our, our entire ecosphere, um, maybe true, may not be true. It didn't just start

350
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,700
all of a sudden, you know, so there's a lot of emphasis on saving us because we're going down a

351
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,300
black hole. And when I'm a little conflicted about it, you know, I have read a lot and,

352
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:32,700
in fact, I posted a link to a different type of documentary, which shows a contrarian view to the

353
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:39,500
inconvenient truth, Al Gore documentary. But the BBC is just bringing on so-called experts one after

354
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,540
another, you know, and they're just rattling off all these statistics and, you know, 40% of the

355
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:50,380
world uses glacier or water to survive and the glaciers are disappearing, you know, implying,

356
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,900
of course, that 40% of the world will have no water. It may be true, but, you know, it's a very

357
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:01,900
one-sided view and- and I'm just trying to figure out, who's doing this? Who's putting this one

358
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:08,540
out? This show? This is huge. It's a huge show. It costs a tremendous amount of money for the

359
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:15,420
facilities. It's around the globe, you know, it's- I think it's going to be heavily sponsored in

360
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,980
the U.S. So it'll be interesting to see who's sponsoring it, but I'm just going to predict.

361
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:30,220
Now, again, I do my bit to- I do what I feel is sufficient to contribute to

362
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:36,220
conserving energy, conserving energy is the main thing that we do, but this whole idea of buying

363
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:43,740
carbon credits, I predict this is a bubble market. It's, you know, it's a crazy, crazy financial instrument,

364
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:51,500
so you can, you know, you can buy credits. So someone is going to- the way I understand it is this,

365
00:29:52,860 --> 00:30:00,940
a company may have X amount of carbon emissions they can emit per year, and if they reduce that,

366
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:08,940
that reduction can be translated into credits, which now are being traded and bought and sold all

367
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:15,260
over the world, a lot of it online. And to me, it feels a little- a little weird as a financial

368
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,820
instrument. So I think there's going to be a lot of wealth created. This whole green thing in general,

369
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,780
already the U.S. government, I think, spends $4 billion on green projects. You think we could

370
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,580
solve something with that amount of money. But anyway, it's a great show, and, of course,

371
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,820
people bonding together and feeling good together and having a common goal and mission together,

372
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,460
that's always good. And of course, you know, concerts and stuff like that here in the U.K., that's

373
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,780
culture, particularly during the summer, people love the festival, they love getting out, they love

374
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:50,060
being together, sharing music together. So it is a good thing, but still very, very surprised that

375
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:56,940
at all of this information that's being stated as a fact, and just put my question marks around

376
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:03,980
statements that clearly cannot be completely taken as fact, because they're just so much information,

377
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,820
we know so little.

378
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:12,220
Yeah, how's it going, Adam? It's Jersey Todd, the official musicologist of the

379
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:18,940
Chacha, and the hardest work in lawyer and podcast and baby. Hey, you know, I know what you like.

380
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:24,220
I know you like the ladies. And let me drop a little bit of pimped knowledge on you today,

381
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:29,660
because I've got something very, very special. I've got, let's just call it a Manajataadi,

382
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,820
because, well, you know, every once in a while I find something really, really good up on the

383
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:39,340
podcast, music network, and tonight is no exception. Tonight, I've got, well, let's just put it this

384
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,340
way. This is going to be the one time that I'm ever going to be able to tell you that I've got

385
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:50,140
two, two, very, very funky chicks, and that actually happened to be a good thing. These girls have

386
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:55,260
the funk, and they're funky all over, and they're the band, the mob stories, and the song that

387
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,180
they're going to play, called epinephrine, just rocked my socks off, and I think you're going to

388
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,700
like it, too. Check this out on your football Friday. Talk to you later.

389
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:29,260
Singing you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you

390
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:14,760
you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, don't you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, you cry, that's what's going to get me cold, it's what what is going to get me cold and it's what, it's what is what we happen to do to you for you for you for me for you for me for you for me if it's what, what the one is you for?

391
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:35,180
I ain't even a lie, but I think of you for a few years

392
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:40,180
It's been for a bit, guys, you come back, baby

393
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,180
Well, it's been too much, it's been so good

394
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:47,180
I'm back, now I'm back, so that's the way

395
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:52,180
Three weeks, I'm gonna use the big amount, girl, we'll stay here

396
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:56,180
Getting so much fresh, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,180
We're ready, I'm a little busy, yeah, yeah

398
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,180
Well, baby, I'm a little busy, yeah

399
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,180
We're ready, I'm a little busy, yeah

Well, baby, I'm a little busy, yeah

Let's never, I don't wanna be too lazy, let's stop

404
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,180
Let's stop, let's do it, baby

405
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,180
See you, I'm a little busy, let's go

406
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,800
Come, come, come, come down on the ride

407
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,380
And make you lose your life to this

408

You

You

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,380
You

417
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,380
You

418
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,380
You

419
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,380
You

420
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,380
You

421
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,380
You

You

425
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,780
Oh, I know everything I do

426
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,780
Just want to be my friend

427
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,980
And grow up with that face and trend

428
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,980
We'll let the head

429
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,980
To the other workers in the band

430
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,380
And no long days to damn about you

431
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,580
Girl

432
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,180
One gives a damn about you

433
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,380
Girl

434
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,180
No one gives a damn about you

435
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,380
Girl

436
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,180
Don't you try to try to try

437
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,180
If I didn't try

438
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,180
Try to try

439
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,780
If I didn't try

440
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,540
Try

441
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,380
Try

442
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,380
If I didn't try

443
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,980
Try

444
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,380
If I didn't try

445
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,780
Well make you lose your life to this

446
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,180
You

447
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,780
You

448
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,180
You

449
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,980
Never let me go

450
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,780
Make you lose your life to this

451
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,080
You

452
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,180
You

453
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,380
You

454
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:45,780
You

455
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:45,980
You

456
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,380
You

457
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:46,580
You

458
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:46,780
You

459
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:46,980
You

460
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,380
You

461
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:47,580
You

462
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:47,780
You

463
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:47,980
You

464
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,180
You

465
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:48,580
You

466
00:36:48,580 --> 00:37:16,080
Bye-bye!

467
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,580
We're the attitude of a bar Friday.

468
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,580
It kind of reminds me of some funk like from the 80s, you know what I mean?

469
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,580
I was just, well, the song was running a presenter was on stage.

470
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,580
They're trying to get Al Gore to come on, you know, turn on the sound of the background.

471
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:42,580
They're trying to get, you know, trying to get Al Gore on by a satellite into Wembley Arena.

472
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,580
And she was saying, you know, if we all just turned off our pilot lights,

473
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,580
we would save enough carbon emissions.

474
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,580
Here comes Al Gore.

475
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,580
Enough carbon emissions to fill Wembley Stadium over 400 times.

476
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,580
I'm like, what does that mean?

477
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,580
And award-winning luminary.

478
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,580
Okay.

479
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,580
Why don't we just stay with us for a second.

480
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,580
You may have missed it.

481
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,580
So let's see what he has to say.

482
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,580
Oh, there's a nice picture of our planet, Washington.

483
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,580
Hey, they probably use Google Earth, didn't they?

484
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,580
This is the National Museum of the American Indian where Al Gore speaks to the world.

485
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,580
Thank you so much.

486
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:22,580
Dr. Mann, Guggie Cook, what beautiful and eloquent words.

487
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:27,580
Thank you acting director Tim Johnson and the National Museum of the American Indian.

488
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,580
All right.

489
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,580
Al, hello, Wembley, dude.

490
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,580
Hello, Wembley.

491
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Grace, and inviting us here today.

492
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
The American Indian people.

493
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,580
Oh, no.

494
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,580
He doesn't know.

495
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,580
I think he doesn't know.

496
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,580
We've been here for years here and around the world.

497
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,580
Have been very eloquent in their warnings about what we're doing to the Earth.

498
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,580
Oh, be going down.

499
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:51,580
They remind us that solving the climate crisis will require not only new laws and new technologies,

500
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:57,580
but also a new understanding that we are connected to the natural world.

501
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,580
Some who don't understand what is now at stake.

502
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,580
Oh, I have to catch the highlights on the 11 o'clock news.

503
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,580
I hear someone much more important than Al Gore.

504
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,580
Hey, Adam Howard Greenstein here from New York.

505
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:17,580
And I wanted to just thank you for DSC 628 on July 4th, which was a really a great way of trying to explain to everybody out there in the world.

506
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,580
What America is about?

507
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,580
And it's really tough to understand if you're not living here and growing up here.

508
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,580
But I think it did a pretty good job.

509
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:31,580
One thing, though, I think it did miss is that we are here in America most of us, just everyday people.

510
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,580
I mean, whether you're a savant or regular listener to the Charlie,

511
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:41,580
whether you're nylon, pissing you off or prolific programmer who's sometimes difficult to understand.

512
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:48,580
You know, we're all out here just being who we are and who we are for the most part is just everyday people.

513
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:59,580
And so if you're feeling it, if you're feeling the love on Fubar Friday and you want to kick out some really amazing music that tells a lot about what America's like or what a lot of us hope it would be like.

514
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,580
Want you to throw on Sly in the family's stone from the soundtrack to our lives.

515
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,580
And everyday people here on the Charlie.

516
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,580
That's probably the one.

517
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
I'm not a bad idea.

518
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,580
I checked it with the organization for the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives.

519
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,580
It said, go ahead, Curry. You can play that.

520
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:34,580
You've got me.

521
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:39,580
I've never really paid one again.

522
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

523
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

524
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

525
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

526
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

527
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

528
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

529
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

530
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

531
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

532
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,580
There is one lot of fantasy.

533
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

534
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

535
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,580
There is really a lot of fantasy.

536
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,580
There is really a lot of fantasy.

537
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

538
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

539
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

540
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

541
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

542
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,580
There is a lot of fantasy.

543
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,580
There is always a lot of fantasy.

544
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Oh, I can't believe you long, yeah

545
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:35,580
Oh, I can't believe you long, yeah

546
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:40,580
But I can't believe you long, yeah

547
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:50,580
Oh, I can't believe you long, yeah

548
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:55,580
We got to live to hell, yeah

549
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,580
There's a ground where the flowers look black

550
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,580
I'm that pretty, you see the wind, I'm that corner

551
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,580
So I'm the white one, yeah

552
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:11,580
I'm that lost, and so I'm that so wanted to be

553
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:24,580
We're Howard New York, sliding the fountain stone, everyday people

554
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,580
On a maximum music, Fubar, strike that Saturday

555
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,580
Let's see how I'll's doing for a second

556
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,580
He's been talking all that time during the song

557
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,580
Does he have the attention of Wimley Stadium yet?

558
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,580
I just present an Abraham Lincoln

559
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,580
Ow, show me some polar bears that are dying, man

560
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,580
That's what gets my attention

561
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,580
Hi Adam, it's Neil Ford

562
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,580
Just being listening to 69

563
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,580
And you're a bit about podcasts and stuff

564
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,580
I'm just out of interest, and we're on YouTube

565
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,580
Can I find videos of people shooting Bucky Rockies?

566
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,580
Yeah, they're out of these

567
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,580
Because I have to say that the idea of that is just

568
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,580
It's my day

569
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,580
So thank you very much for giving me an image of that

570
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,580
And yeah, if you've got the appropriate keywords to search

571
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,580
And I will, I suspect Bucky Rockie and Alice would work

572
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,580
I'd much appreciate it

573
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,580
Actually, you'll keep up the great work

574
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,580
So it's been brought in recently

575
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,580
And yeah, take it

576
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,580
Thank you, thank you so much

577
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,580
Well, I don't know if you actually took the time

578
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,580
Or, you know, all it is is three words put it right into YouTube

579
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,580
Ask Rocket and fireworks

580
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,580
And there's a whole bunch of them

581
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
This is my favorite actually

582
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,580
I'll put a link to this in the show notes

583
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,580
So wait, let me just set this up

584
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,580
What did you put it in?

585
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,580
So there's, and there must be at least 10 or 15 videos

586
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,580
Of people shooting, you know, like the small baby finger

587
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,580
Type bottle rockets out of their ass

588
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,580
So you stick the rocket between your butt cheeks

589
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,580
And then someone else lights it and it goes off

590
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,580
And most people are standing and kind of clamming

591
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,580
There is an art to it, okay?

592
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,580
Because there's not a lot of force coming out of the rocket

593
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,580
And if you just place it in the neck of a bottle

594
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,580
There's no friction

595
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,580
So, you know, people clenching it between their butt cheeks

596
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,580
That's friction, so eight times out of ten

597
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,580
The rocket ignites, it doesn't leave the buttocks

598
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,580
And it synges their ass

599
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,580
And it's funny, of course, but this one guy

600
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,580
I'll just rewind this a little bit

601
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,580
This one guy

602
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,580
He, he actually, he gets on his back

603
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,580
And he, and he points his ass

604
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,580
He's not like in a porn position

605
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,580
Points his ass up

606
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,580
And his friends then stick the rocket in

607
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,580
Well, let's listen in

608
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,580
Oh, it's on his head

609
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,580
But if you go get on your back

610
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,080
Look, they put it in

611
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,080
Just keep going with that

612
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,580
They're fighting a bleibt in

613
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:42,580
Somebody hold his legs back and somebody's like

614
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,580
The guys holding his body's feet

615
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,580
To asshole, don't worry about it

616
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,260
Just your balance is first.

617
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,100
Asked down.

618
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,620
Pulling your sack up first.

619
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,900
Pull your sack up.

620
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,420
But this is really a very adventurous pose

621
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,500
I would have to say.

622
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,260
And guys, like, he is a human rocket launch

623
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,540
and now what happens is, of course.

624
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,420
And if there goes, it's not leaving the buttocks.

625
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,820
He is, he is writhing.

626
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,660
And now it's about to explode while I was still in his ass.

627
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,380
Wonderful.

628
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,820
Wonderful.

629
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,820
Ah, the things that get me going on a Saturday morning

630
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,820
I can't fall asleep all when I'm tired.

631
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:38,820
The only way I'll sleep is if I die.

632
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:45,820
I need a little luxury with your arms around me.

633
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:51,820
And the feeling that you're all I need.

634
00:45:52,820 --> 00:46:00,820
We gibi my idv.

635
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,820
Breathing onto your head.

636
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:12,940
So why do you all want to get me here when Irie?

637
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:20,780
Oh, stop complaining, you'reams around me.

638
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:26,780
And the feeling that you're only

639
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,780
I'm the free

640
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,780
that I care

641
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,780
And I'm the free

642
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,780
You know

643
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:57,780
And the feeling that you're only

644
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,780
I need a little opportunity

645
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,780
But your arms are around me

646
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,780
And I'm the feeling that you're only

647
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:18,780
And I'm the feeling that you're only

648
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,780
Again, from the archives of the Potsay Museum Network

649
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,780
And definitely Golden Oli for Charlie Listeners, the Muffs

650
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,780
And just a little bit of luxury

651
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,780
Hi, this is John from Dallas on the listener

652
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,780
I am currently driving to work and listening to Monday's episode of the BSC

653
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,780
I just wanted to ask you about this nine-line character

654
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,780
Is this guy for real?

655
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,780
It's somebody that's on your payroll

656
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,780
It's getting accurate

657
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,780
What a negative shit

658
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,780
John, I can't stand listening to this guy

659
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,780
I'd rather listen to CSB, he's negative too

660
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,780
But at least he's funny

661
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,780
This guy is just a whiny mother fucker

662
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,780
Language, please

663
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,780
No, he's not on the payroll

664
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,780
He's not, I don't think he's an actor

665
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,780
We still don't really know what he does

666
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,780
Because he won't devolves the information

667
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,780
But he's for real dude, he's totally for real

668
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,780
And now that I've figured out that I've been missing out on voice mail messages

669
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,780
I'm sure I'll be hearing a lot more from him

670
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,780
Hey Adam, listen to Craig here

671
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,780
Wondering where CSB comic strip blogger is

672
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,780
I heard nylon talking

673
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,780
And he's certainly grabbed you

674
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,780
But comic strip blogger is more interesting

675
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,780
That's a survey

676
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,780
The other thing is on your set list

677
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:54,780
Can you make some of your questions the optional

678
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,780
So people who are a little more privacy concerns

679
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,780
And still be involved

680
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,780
That would be useful

681
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,780
Take care, do a great job, bye

682
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,780
Well that's an interesting question

683
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,780
People who have a little more privacy

684
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,780
Well you have to, I guess you have to let me know

685
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,780
Which ones you'd want to be optional

686
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,780
That's actually the way I think it should be done

687
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,780
You should be able to opt out of any question

688
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,780
Eh, some to look at, I'm sure I will get around to it

689
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:20,780
Sometime in the coming week

690
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,780
Of course two questions, two statements, two callers

691
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,780
Back to back saying that they're not big fans of the nylon

692
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,780
Who of course will continue to be able to enjoy

693
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,780
The Charlie as his platform

694
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,780
Because he has such contrary views

695
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,780
And both people also asking about CSB

696
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,780
The infamous comic strip blogger

697
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,780
Comic strip

698
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,780
Comic strip

699
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,780
Comic strip

700
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,780
Comic strip

701
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,780
Adam Kerry, you fucking idiot

702
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,780
Your DSC publish on USA Independence Day

703
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,780
2007 was not shitty

704
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,780
You may be ignorant, lazy and shallow asshole

705
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,780
But your sincerity, hands more

706
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,780
You are just too kind, comic strip blogger

707
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,780
Let me clarify one thing

708
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,780
You are fucking wrong about pointing out

709
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:17,780
UK and Brits as main brothers of USA

710
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,780
Actually, there's only 24 million English Americans

711
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,780
Originating from Britain

712
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,780
But 49 million German Americans

713
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,780
34 million Irish Americans

714
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,780
14 million Italian Americans, 10 million Polish Americans

715
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,780
I'm Polish myself, 8 million French Americans

716
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,780
And only 5 million Scottish Americans

717
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,780
Like yourself

718
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,780
You know CSB, CSB

719
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,780
So maybe you misunderstood me

720
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,780
I was talking about the original settlers who went over

721
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,780
They came from Britain

722
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,780
And I'm talking about in the past two hundred and twenty thirty years

723
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,780
I'm talking about the original, you know, the guys in the 1700s

724
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,780
That's what I meant

725
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,780
And by the way, what are you reading from what's your source?

726
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,780
Many, many, many millions of other known British Americans

727
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,780
And English language, anyway, is just a mixture of German, French, and Italian

728
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,780
So while USA has British and European, your roots

729
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,780
It is much more than the sum of its parts

730
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,780
And if you add them, carry

731
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,780
Blackberry, really, like UK

732
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,780
Then get yourself UK citizenship

733
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,780
And does EU citizenship

734
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,780
And have both USA and UK citizenship

735
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:40,780
And for facts, they stop whining about these British American things

736
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,780
And concentrate on the future on your pod business

737
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,780
You fucking quanker

738
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,780
You're a comic strip

739
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,780
I feel so much better

740
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,780
Comic strip

741
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,780
I know what to focus on

742
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,780
Comic strip, she spent the rest of my life doing

743
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,780
Thank you so much, strip

744
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,780
I love you man, thank you so much

745
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,780
Hey Adam, it's Father Roderick

746
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,780
You'll never guess where I'm recording this

747
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,780
You know how much I like to travel and to take people with me to

748
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,780
It's Lee, Franz, Ireland, or the United States and my

749
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,780
Sound seeing tours for the Catholic insider podcast

750
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:20,780
But this is without a doubt the coolest place I've ever been

751
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,780
I am walking around in Middle-earth

752
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,780
You might have heard of this new online role playing game, The Lord of the Rings Online

753
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,780
But it likes second life for elves and hobbits

754
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,780
Now I love this game

755
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,780
It is one of the most beautiful online worlds I've ever visited

756
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:43,780
And once you're in the game, you can travel to all these fantastic places that you remember from the Lord of the Rings movies and the books

757
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,780
And the great thing about these virtual worlds is

758
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,780
Even though it's cold and rainy here in Holland, in Middle-earth, it's warm and sunny

759
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,780
Hey, I'm thirsty

760
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,780
Here's a hobbit pub, let's go inside

761
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,780
Hello there, how may I help you?

762
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,780
I'd like to have something to drink please

763
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,780
Stay and have some tea

764
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,780
Tea is far too hot for tea, I'd rather have a pint

765
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,780
Don't please to be of service

766
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:10,780
Let's sit down first there

767
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:15,780
You know Adam, hundreds of thousands of gamers visit this world every day

768
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:21,780
But I think that a lot of them might not be aware of the fascinating history of the sights and the people they come across here in Middle-earth

769
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,780
Did you ever wonder why elves are immortal?

770
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,780
And where are these horrid orcs come from?

771
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,780
Just the other day I was in the old forest for a quest

772
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,780
And I met Tom Bombadale

773
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,780
Now did you know that this guy is thousands of years old

774
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,780
And if you leave the Shire and travel north

775
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,780
You'll discover this incredible city on the shores of Lake Evendim

776
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,780
Like Twilight as the elves call it

777
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,780
It's now in ruins and it's a dangerous place

778
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:54,780
But do you know it was once a royal city founded by one of the ancestors of Aragon

779
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:04,780
My new podcast series, The Secrets of the Lord of the Rings, is a first podcast ever that is completely recorded within Middle-earth

780
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,780
Every show is a sound seeing tour of a different region

781
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,780
And if you plug in your earbuds and close your eyes

782
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,780
The magic of the theater of the mind will take you

783
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,780
A journey of discovery through this wonderful world created by J.R.R. Tolkien

784
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,780
So if you play the Lord of the Rings online or if you're just a fan of the movies

785
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:28,780
Where you've read the books head over to www.sqpn.com

786
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,780
And subscribe to the Secrets of the Lord of the Rings

787
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,780
And now it's time for a pint for these hobbits here

788
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,780
Talk to you later Adam

789
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,780
It's time to organize a search party

790
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,780
Father Roderick has has completely lost it

791
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,780
He's gone deep into a second life type world

792
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,780
He may need me

793
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,780
Sounds great though Roderick

794
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,780
Like in that a lot, dude

795
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,780
It's a football Friday Saturday edition

796
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,780
Maximum music

797
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,780
People go on smoke breaks

798
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,780
Others serve the web

799
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,780
Some people get up and grab a coffee

800
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,780
But I'm not one of them

801
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,780
I don't like being a net

802
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,780
All I smoke is grass

803
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:21,780
I prefer to spend my time sitting on my skinny white ass

804
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,780
I've been some life's all around the room

805
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,780
Just right before I start

806
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,780
Sometimes I'm in there for 30 minutes

807
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,780
And all I do is fart

808
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,780
So if the facts machines on the fritz

809
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,780
And that'll copiers go in berserk

810
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,780
Don't ask me to play Mr. Repair

811
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,780
And when I'm taking a dog at work

812
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,780
Or I'm taking a dog, I'm taking a dog

813
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,780
I'm taking a dog at work

814
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,780
But don't bother me

815
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,780
You can't just see him just taking a dog at work

816
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,780
I go in around 11 o'clock

817
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:00,780
I go back in after lunch

818
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,780
Every time it comes out right on the dime

819
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,780
And it looks like a nestly crunch

820
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,780
And I'm afraid to you who's the Johnny

821
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,780
And that's all my floor

822
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,780
There'll be a 10-minute layover

823
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,780
Before anyone should open the door

824
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,780
After he's been taking a dog

825
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,780
We're taking a dog, we're taking a dog

826
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,780
We're taking a dog and we're equal

827
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,780
But don't bother me

828
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:26,780
You can't just see him just taking a dog at work

829
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,780
And if I'm not in my disc

830
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,780
And I'll be on the porcelain throne

831
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,780
I'll waste my day on the crapper

832
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,780
Until this time to go home

833
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,780
I don't talk to me through the storm

834
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,780
And you break my concentration

835
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,780
The last thing that I need right now

836
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,780
Is a case of constipation

837
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:52,780
And I'm a fan of the courtesy flush

838
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,780
That's yeah

839
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,780
I like my ass tape a three-plot kick

840
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,780
You know I sat on the shit of this afternoon

841
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,780
And read mail bills moving dick

842
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,780
Twice so you can call me Ishmael bitch when I'm taking a dog

843
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,780
But taking a dog

844
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,780
But taking a dog

845
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:07,780
It would be

846
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,780
I don't bother me

847
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,780
You can't just see him just taking a dog at work

848
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,780
I don't care the boss is looking

849
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,780
I don't care if the phone is ringing

850
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,780
I'll be in here dropping the news

851
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,780
And you'll probably hear me singing

852
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,780
That I don't take a dog

853
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,780
But taking a dog

854
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,780
But taking a dog

855
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,780
It would be like

856
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,780
I don't bother me

857
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,780
You can't just see him just taking a dog

858
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:37,780
That would be

859
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,780
I'm proud of him

860
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:48,780
I'm proud of him

861
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,780
I'm proud of him

862
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,780
He's popping his head

863
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,780
And then he's going back

864
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,780
You

865
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,780
Yeah

866
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,780
I'm proud of him

867
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,780
I'm proud of him

868
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,780
You're as if

869
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,780
So the next time you're in your office

870
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,780
And your stomach starts to jerk

871
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,780
Get outta your chair and drop a shower

872
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:16,780
And take you and don't badly

873
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,780
Well luckily I work at home

874
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:21,780
So

875
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,780
Dumping makes a lot more pleasurable

876
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,780
You know what I'm saying

877
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:25,780
Stock, stuck in my heart

878
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,780
We're taking a dump at work

879
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:35,100
I don't know, Dan Johnson, Daniel Johnson Jr. from Southwestern Ohio, which is listening

880
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:41,420
to Daily Source Code 629er from Thursday.

881
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:47,540
And really, this is a kind of contact content and the real reason why I listened to your

882
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:53,220
show is to, I'm really excited about the channel concept and some of the stuff that you're

883
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:58,940
talking about with being able to do, I've been watching the Cheddar videos that you've

884
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:01,740
been posting over at curie.com.

885
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,100
And pretty excited about that.

886
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:10,080
And as I mentioned in an earlier audio comment, I've been using channels back since August

887
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,980
or whenever you launched a pod show plus, which is actually, hey, happy birthday to you,

888
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:19,860
pod show plus, by the way, I guess there's a birthday coming up.

889
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:24,420
And one of the things that I have noticed though is that I'll receive a message from

890
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:31,580
a content producer, podcaster or blogger or, you know, a content producer saying that they've

891
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,300
uploaded the news show.

892
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:37,980
And I'll go and check the feed or I'll go and check the channel and I'll see that it hasn't

893
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:38,980
shown up there.

894
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:45,100
And I'm really getting to geeky, geeky, would be helpful to understand how all this

895
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:49,140
is going to work out with how the feeds are going to get up to it because you're talking

896
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:54,300
about matching up channels and individual items within a channel and how the feeds get

897
00:59:54,300 --> 01:00:01,140
updated because it seems like there are some days that I won't get anything and then

898
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,260
maybe a couple of days later I'll start getting everything and I'll be catching up with

899
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,260
everything.

900
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:13,860
I subscribe and choose a former iPod lemon to, a couple of pod show plus feeds, one

901
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:20,100
of them is my music podcast feed and then one is like everything else.

902
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:25,380
And I'm just wondering if there's a maximum number of shows you can put into a channel

903
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:31,300
or if that really even matters, if you could set some light on that, that would be great.

904
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:35,060
They had jobs to get and come in from to you from a Southwest and Ohio make it a great

905
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,060
day.

906
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,060
Everybody.

907
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,060
Dan, thank you so much, man.

908
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:45,700
You know what, what you're probably witnessing is something that's very complicated

909
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,580
to do, not to understand.

910
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:51,580
So you have all these feeds living all around the world because you're using the channels

911
01:00:51,580 --> 01:01:00,060
to basically enjoy shows, content, music, programming, video audio from other places as

912
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:04,300
well and so we're giving a utility to do that and to organize.

913
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,900
Now a lot of these feeds and this is iTunes has the same problem.

914
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:14,140
They have to be checked and they have to be checked regularly and of course if you're

915
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:17,380
talking hundreds of thousands of feeds it becomes quite a chore.

916
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:24,100
So part of the way you solve it is by more processes doing the same functions.

917
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:29,780
There are ping servers around the web that unfortunately are not utilized as well as they

918
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:37,100
could be by by systems that upload and and publish feeds.

919
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,020
I think Podshow actually does that automatically.

920
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:42,660
I'll have to double check because I know we certainly implemented something a long time

921
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,660
ago.

922
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:48,700
So checking these feeds there can definitely be a lag.

923
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,460
So we're getting better.

924
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:56,460
The way people are implementing technology hopefully will get a little bit better too.

925
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,060
And sometimes servers just don't respond.

926
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:03,660
They're not available and then they have to wait for another pass for another go around

927
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,060
on the merry-go-round.

928
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:11,140
So absolutely you're definitely seeing those types of issues crop up and it's a continuing

929
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,140
process.

930
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,580
Part of it is due to scale.

931
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:18,900
Just lots of people collecting stuff and more importantly lots of stuff that people want

932
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,180
to collect from the outside.

933
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,820
So a lot of work.

934
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:23,820
Absolutely.

935
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,820
You know what I haven't done a long time?

936
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:28,980
I haven't played anything from my girlfriend and I feel really shitty about that let me

937
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:33,100
tell you.

938
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:37,780
And he closes to who this is now.

939
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:42,220
Come on you know she's got those dulcetones.

940
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:54,780
Love Spiral's featuring Andrew B walk away.

941
01:02:54,780 --> 01:03:00,560
Blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue purple

Gloom Ivory peanut through cloud.

945
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:39,240
I feel it's easy I don't want to take the fall

946
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:45,240
I've planned to see the song once

947
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:50,240
Just want to take it all, yeah

948
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:58,240
Then walk away, yeah

949
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:06,240
I've come close to the vibe

950
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:11,240
Nearly burn my hands

951
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,240
I've been lifted high

952
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:23,240
To bed up to the sins you

953
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:32,240
Now I walk away from my own space

954
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:43,240
I've had a way to save again

955
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:52,240
How long away from my own space

956
01:04:53,240 --> 01:05:01,240
How long away from my own space

957
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:09,240
How long away from my own space

958
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:15,240
How long away from my own space

959
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:24,240
How long away from my own space

960
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:31,240
How long away from my own space

961
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,240
How long away from my own space

962
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:46,240
How long away from my own space

963
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:53,240
See I won't go away

964
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:59,240
Find my own space

965
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:04,240
Ooh, see I won't go away

966
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:09,240
Till I feel safe, again

967
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:13,240
I won't go away

968
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:18,240
Find my own space

969
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:23,240
Ooh, see I won't go away

970
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:29,240
Find my own space

971
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:34,240
Ooh, see I won't go away

972
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:39,240
Till I feel safe, again

973
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:46,240
I won't go away

974
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:55,240
I won't go away

975
01:06:55,240 --> 01:07:00,240
Love spirals, as you beat, I walk away

976
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,240
Furgies on stage in life are the black eyed peas

977
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,240
She was doing interview with Jonathan Ross

978
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:11,240
She said, I don't think today is a day for my lady lumps

979
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:16,240
Looks like a great time that looks like everyone is enjoying themselves

980
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,240
It does seem that we have a green fever catching on

981
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,240
Everyone is going to websites and calculating their carbon usage

982
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,240
Really have no idea what it all means, it just seems like an awful lot

983
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,240
But you know what the result of it are?

984
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,240
Well, really our natural resources, our fossil fuels

985
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:38,240
We're going to need to stretch that a little bit, I'm pretty confident

986
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,240
So that's not a bad thing at all

987
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,240
Hey, before we cut out here

988
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,240
When ever you send something, I'm always curious

989
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:55,240
Hi, I'm Dr. Pryle, I'm here from Sydney, Australia, here for vacation

990
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,240
Oh my goodness, the boy does get around, doesn't he?

991
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,240
Why do you comment regarding games?

992
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,240
It's a comment on the July 4th, 2007 episode

993
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:08,240
Number 628, the daily source code, where he's

994
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:15,240
Ranting about the American fast level of Uber patriotism

995
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,240
As we call it here

996
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,240
Uber patriotism

997
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:23,240
Is that what you call it in the UK in Australia?

998
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,240
Where?

999
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:32,240
I find it really almost disgusting as to how

1000
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,240
I know where the U-yanks are about the world

1001
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,240
Not you personally, but some of you

1002
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:42,240
Starting with the president going down to the

1003
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,240
Well, did the chat by the coffee from every morning?

1004
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:52,240
Um, it's almost odd when I meet someone

1005
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:55,240
I mean, it's saddened at the use as a medical hospital

1006
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,240
We just not know where London is for instance

1007
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,240
Um, that's all she has

1008
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,240
You're disgusted by that

1009
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,240
Dude, you gotta give us a little break

1010
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:11,240
You know, we live on a continent like a whole continent in a way

1011
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:14,240
It's, you know, for thousands of years

1012
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,240
You guys have been crossing each other's countries

1013
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:19,240
Beating the crap out of each other so you kind of know the way

1014
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,240
You know, but it's a different continent

1015
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,240
Only a couple hundred years and it's been even shorter than that

1016
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,240
That the transatlantic travel has really been possible

1017
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:31,240
I think if you really trace back history, it's, it's pretty logical

1018
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:34,240
Now, that's not to say that I don't think it's disgusting

1019
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:37,240
That the people aren't drilled that in school

1020
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,240
And that they at least have some kind of understanding

1021
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,240
But that is a whole other issue

1022
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,240
We've got to talk about education

1023
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,240
I think history should start with

1024
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,240
Good morning class

1025
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,240
Let's look at today's paper

1026
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,240
Let's look at the issues that are being discussed

1027
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,240
And let's trace back historical roots to the problem

1028
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,240
Now that

1029
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,240
That would be a history lesson

1030
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:02,240
Nothing's wrong but it's alright

1031
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:09,240
I lay me down to sleep tonight

1032
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:17,240
Toss and turn, sleep on car

1033
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:24,240
Restless for the sun

1034
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:35,240
The dreamer dream with you in view

1035
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:42,240
Better times and dreams come true

1036
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:49,240
As what open tell me where's the dawn

1037
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:55,240
Restless for the sun

1038
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,240
The view from here

1039
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:03,240
Don't darken

1040
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:10,240
It's shout so clear in my mind

1041
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:19,240
Don't break in through darkness

1042
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:27,240
Dreams come true in better times

1043
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:34,240
So hold me close and speak to me

1044
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:41,240
For the dreams we've yet to see

1045
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:48,240
Can't wait to see you when the morning comes

1046
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:53,240
Restless for the sun

1047
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:34,240
So hold me close and speak to me

1048
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:40,240
For the dreams we've yet to see

1049
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:47,240
Can't wait to see you when the morning comes

1050
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:54,240
Restless for the sun

1051
01:12:54,240 --> 01:13:00,240
Restless for the sun

1052
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:04,240
Jimmy Bradshaw, another pot of music favorite

1053
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,240
Restless for the sun

1054
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:10,240
Winding up a food bar Friday

1055
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:13,240
There in walls as Adam

1056
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,240
Going against my better judgment

1057
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,240
Sending you with three minute feedback file

1058
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,240
Which unfortunately I didn't get

1059
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,240
But I'll read the email

1060
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,240
You're normally gracious enough to play my feedback

1061
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,240
Then of course I tend to keep them short

1062
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,240
Promotion just gave me so much that I had to tell you

1063
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,240
Give it a listen at least

1064
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,240
Key points

1065
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,240
How many of us should put them be three as a part of this?

1066
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,240
The information from the Coca-Cola message

1067
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,240
The text message that is sent to the participant is wrong

1068
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:39,240
The code gives you either a 79 pence or a 99 pence

1069
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,240
DRM free track

1070
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:44,240
You also get entered into a draw for an 80 gigabod iPod

1071
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,240
I finished with a 30 second film

1072
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,240
The DSA here we go

1073
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,240
This is the part I wanted

1074
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,240
The DSC is making existing advertising work better

1075
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:56,240
I thrown away numerous bottles of Coca-Cola with these codes on it

1076
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,240
It only listening to the DSC that actually prompted me to use them

1077
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,240
Many many thanks

1078
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,240
It's from DRM

1079
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,240
The guy with the hot sounding wife

1080
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,240
Craftman

1081
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,240
Would you please just have your wife send the comment for me?

1082
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,240
Yeah, that would I would appreciate that

1083
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,240
This summer when you buy Coke

1084
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,240
Do you get music

1085
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,240
You can win an iPod

1086
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,240
Or free songs on iTunes

1087
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,240
What day is it today?

1088
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,240
It's Friday

1089
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,240
Saturday

1090
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:24,240
Saturday

1091
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,240
I can't get away without it

1092
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,240
Final thought of the week

1093
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,240
It's Saturday

1094
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,240
And I'm Friday

1095
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,240
The jingle don't match up

1096
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,240
I don't know

1097
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,240
Look at this library thing

1098
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:37,240
Maybe you know I'm a guy who likes to do instead of talk

1099
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,240
Well, that's not how I like to talk to

1100
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,240
But there are talkers and there are doers

1101
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:44,240
With all this energy that's being

1102
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,240
It's positive energy that I'm seeing generated here for libraries

1103
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,240
Maybe that's something that all the talkers can do

1104
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,240
If you have a weblog or a podcast

1105
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,240
Why don't you say something nice

1106
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,240
Why don't you know a lot of weblogs is like

1107
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,240
You, you, you, you look at what this person's saying

1108
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,240
I don't I'd you should agree with him

1109
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,240
It's a lot of disagree disagree

1110
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,240
Don't see a lot of link love

1111
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,240
Just pure out of love these days and seeps

1112
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,240
Maybe it's just what's in my world

1113
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,240
But the way it feels after that

1114
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:12,240
So why don't you just post a note and say hey

1115
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,240
Read this guy's weblog

1116
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,240
This is person's podcast

1117
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,240
Because I like him there my buddy

1118
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,240
And my friend I appreciate what they do

1119
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:22,240
Or just be nice to a fellow human being

1120
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,240
Go smile to someone on the street

1121
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,240
That type of energy

1122
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,240
Now that would be really good for the world

1123
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,240
So you can do it you can do it just by sitting there behind

1124
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,240
You're a little weasely keyboard in the underwear

1125
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,240
And you could do some nice for somebody

1126
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,240
And if you actually feel like it

1127
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,240
You know call someone out of family member

1128
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,240
It's great a little bit of positive energy this weekend

1129
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,240
I'm going to do it I hope you'll join in

1130
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,240
