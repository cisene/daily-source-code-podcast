00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey home fries, it's CC Chapman from accident hash, encouraging you to check out

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
botod.tv slash battle.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's one of the coolest battle events out there and you can only find it at botod.tv.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's see if I can fix Adam not doing daily source codes on Friday for Fubar.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hmm, I'll hack into curry.com.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Password Patricia is hot, okay.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And let's find the code for Fubar Friday.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Alright, and we'll edit it to make it when Fubar equals bar and results to day of week equals Friday.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Then do show equals true.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Alright, that should have fixed it.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now we're looking forward to the DSC 649 on Fubar Friday.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It was $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We don't need no sticking friends in it.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Fantastic, this battle curry.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, it's Ubar Friday and what could be more Fubar than having Matthew we will say.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Pete, put your pants back on. This is the daily source code 649.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're a birding man, Adam.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a bird

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a bird, you're a birding man, you're a bird, you're an you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding man, you're a birding

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't do it, when you want to say it to it

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Lay it up to the moon, lay it right up on their hands

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And do it, come on

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm just it wasn't easy

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Chained in rock and roll with my hands

27
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The paper can shake in

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I thought I'd have to leave it behind

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh, I know it's so much better, it's so much better

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm from getting out and get out of your way

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But I'm not all loose at feeling

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You know I won't

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I've held all the money so many years

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
When they were best of us and you

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And we went to the moon and just wait

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We didn't make up some part of turn around

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We went to the moon and just wait

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We didn't make up some part of turn around

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We lied so don't do it, when it wanted to It

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We lied so don't do it, when it wanted to

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We lied so don't do it, when it wanted to

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000

Once again attract from the 99 entertainment hitmakers in Switzerland

72
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I've been waiting for them to put some new stuff on the podcast

73
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Music Network and they have come through

74
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Girl stuff is back

75
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're secret

76
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I love it

77
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't know, it's a screw the spice girl's man

78
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It'd be girl stuff

79
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And where can I find pictures of them?

80
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And yes, you know what kind of pictures I'm talking about

81
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's right everybody that could only mean one thing

82
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yon Polat in the house

83
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh my god, you're casting with Adam

84
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Hey Adam, are you ready to be stumps

85
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because he used the human characters with Yon Polat

86
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Hey Adam, how are you doing?

87
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is hit us number 82

88
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And it's the first one after all the stuff happening here

89
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
After a moving to a rice bike

90
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And after the miscarriage

91
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The day after I moved

92
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So we were in the middle of all sorts of boxes

93
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And we couldn't find anything

94
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And then the tragedy happened

95
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I must tell you that the amount of messages of sympathy

96
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And stuff like that really supported us a lot

97
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And helped us cope with that situation

98
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Well things are getting better every day

99
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So I want to thank everyone who

100
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, send us a message or call us up

101
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Or left a comment on the website

102
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Thank you very much

103
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It was really overwhelming but really hard warming

104
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So thanks again

105
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
All righty to hit us

106
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Here we go again with three intros

107
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And this is number one

108
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It sounds like

109
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I have no idea

110
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It sounds a little bit like Billy Joel teller about it

111
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't think that's number two

112
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah, I know this one

113
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's a whole young every time you go away

114
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Where is Paul Young?

115
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Actually he's gone away I guess

116
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And number three

117
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What?

118
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
A wild guess man either hall notes

119
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I have no idea

120
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Talk this way

121
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's time's up and these are the answers

122
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This is number one

123
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
From 1983

124
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Joel and teller about it

125
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
To accept our real

126
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Teller about it

127
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
To roll the crazy trees

128
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's have no argument

129
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Billy

130
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's have no argument

131
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Good to write a song

132
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Joel is into number one

133
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And this is into number two from 1985

134
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This is Paul Young

135
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Hey

136
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We can still get it longer

137
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Can't you sit

138
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We've got nothing going on

139
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Come on

140
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Every time you go

141
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Away

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You take a piece of me

143
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
With you

144
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Every time you go away

145
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
By Paul Young

146
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You're sent to number two

147
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And that's not number three

148
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Also from 1985

149
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Steve you wonder

150
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Come on

151
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Come on

152
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Come on

153
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The letter

154
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You made it

155
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
From one of the two we want

156
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
With Paul Young

157
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Love her

158
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Come on

159
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We wish you could meet

160
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You passed me by

161
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Don't even speak

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No one can speak

163
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000

172
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That concludes hit this number 82 for this week

173

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
By the Sultan of Savon's Savon's

209
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000

About Iraq's legal Iraq's legal weapons programs

211
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors

212
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And it's links to terrorist groups

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Georgie Porgie puttin' and pie

214
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Picked some boys and made them die

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Georgie Porgie puttin' and pie

216
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
In his playpan in the White House of lies

217
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Sad around with all of his friends

218
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Told him all on him to depend

219
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Boyle is one, all of a sudden

220
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The American have it with you

221
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
There's a place that we're gonna attack

222
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
For their oil and for daddy Iraq

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Georgie Porgie made up a war

224
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Told some lies about what it was for

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Now you're baby, his out in Iraq

226
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Do you know if they're coming back

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh mama, how wanna come home

228
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
How wanna hear your voice on the phone

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
A straightforward, just move on the side

230
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Got to find somewhere to hide

231
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh mama, do something for me

232
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh my kids, kids, my family

233
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Tell them I'll be home in a while

234
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But I don't die today

235
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
In a small town, something like here

236
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Something's grown, something called the ear

237
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Who's our phone, who really knows

238
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Just be careful, where your vote goes

239
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This November will be the true test

240
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Can this country get out of this mess?

241
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Boyle rich liars continue to rule

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Come on people, let's stop being born

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh mama, how wanna come home

244
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
How wanna hear your voice on the phone

245
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Every day, one of the stars

246
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Do me the deal, believe your life

247
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh mama, do something for me

248
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh my kids, kids, my family

249
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll hope that I'll be home in a while

250
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But I can die today

251
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And die today

252
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Come, die today

253
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Your enemy is not surrounding your country

254
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Your enemy is ruling your country

255
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And the day he and his regime

256
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Are removed from power

257
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Will be the day of your liberation

258
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You thought protests songs went out in the 60s

259
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Uh-huh, they're live and well

260
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And you just don't hear this shit on the radio

261
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's where it belongs right here

Check it out, let me know what you think

298
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I did a freestyle at the end of the show

299
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And I know I'm not a rapper, but I try, man

300
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000

And just hope all that goes well

302

Much love and much happiness

310
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm out

311
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
In a world where TV networks, movie studios and record labels

312
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Still think they can govern what you see in here

313
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses

314
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And make big media corporations wet their tiny little pants

315
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
From Pod Show, home of the world's most dangerous new content

316
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Comes the daily source code with Adam Curry

317
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It helps to keep us young

318
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Whether city on the affection of our sense of love

319
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
To who we are to be

320
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
A new way to love for me

321
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I wish I didn't want you see

322
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Has it drawn into the sea?

323
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Has it drawn into the sea?

324
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:55,000
How are we to the sun?

325
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The road to place where we can't forget where we're from

326
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But the truth gets in the way we want done

327
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
But we are on the road on the run

328
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And the answer only makes us numb

329
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I send full of

330
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
To who we are to be

331
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
A new way to love for me

332
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I wish I didn't want you see

333
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Has it drawn into the sea?

334
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Has it drawn into the sea?

335
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Has it drawn into the sea?

336
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
To who we are to be?

337
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
A new way to love for me

338
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I wish I didn't want you see

339
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Has it drawn into the sea?

340
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Has it drawn into the sea?

341
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Has it drawn into the sea?

342
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Has it drawn into the sea?

343
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Has it drawn into the sea?

344
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Has it drawn into the sea?

345
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I wish I'd have been a summertime moon

346
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I went to the sun and no walking.

347
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
They hail of course from nowhere else, but New Jersey.

348
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Excellent.

349
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,600
From the Podsate Music Network at music.podge.com, or if you just want to see all the cool

350
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,000
pretty pictures in the music, and you don't want to join the network, then go to

351
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Podge.com slash music.

352
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah, man.

353
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm ready for some, well, that really vacation.

354
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Because, you know, I'll be doing the show.

355
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We've got the family reunion.

356
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But we thanks to Chef Mark.

357
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
We got hooked up with an awesome beach house on Fire Island.

358
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And, you know, I wanted a big place because Willow, my sister,

359
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and Italy, is coming to the reunion.

360
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And, her husband, Alessandro, can't come because he's got to work.

361
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And, so she's bringing her two kids who are darling, by the way.

362
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And I said, well, why don't we get like a big house?

363
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Well, I'll hang out and we'll cook Italian.

364
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And I actually try to get my other sister to come, but, unfortunately,

365
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
she's her son has to go to school.

366
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Unlike the Wednesday after the Monday after the reunion.

367
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So that just didn't work out.

368
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Because, I thought it would be fun.

369
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You know, have the whole family.

370
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And so Willow was like, oh, this looks really cool.

371
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And she looked it up.

372
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I think that she Googled her.

373
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
She did a Wikipedia search, I think, on Fire Island.

374
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah, it's going to be very interesting.

375
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I have a feeling that I will have a pretty big party with the locals.

376
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Hey, today wouldn't be a football friday or wouldn't be a complete football friday

377
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
without at least one cranky savant calling in.

378
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Come extra.

379
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Come extra.

380
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Come extra.

381
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Come extra.

382
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Come extra.

383
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Come extra.

384
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Come extra.

385
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Come extra.

386
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Come extra.

387
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Hello, Adam.

388
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Here is me, the CSV.

389
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So I know that you will sell but show component to the highest bidder who offers more than

390
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
100 million US dollars.

391
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Come extra blogger.

392
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
100 million got to be a lot more than that, my friend.

393
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And you don't give a monkey.

394
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What monkeys?

395
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Let me say.

396
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But let me tell you that I hate two things in putshow.com.

397
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I guess if we fix these two things, then someone will buy us for 100 million.

398
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That was the second CSV.

399
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Do you don't you get it by now?

400
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm doing this because I want to.

401
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Firstly, I hate that there are no RSS feeds to comments.

402
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Secondly, I hate that there is no method for doing upload with the resume after

403
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
interruption in outoring API of putshow.com.

404
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
A very very important feature for wireless applications.

405
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Please tell your code monkeys to code it.

406
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Or I will be very angry monkey myself.

407
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And I will have to say.

408
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Fuck you.

409
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Adam theory.

410
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Instead of the usual.

411
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You.

412
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah, I know.

413
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The comments on RSS.

414
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I don't know.

415
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I got mixed feelings about that.

416
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You know.

417
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's a free and well.

418
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I mean, you post almost every single show CSV, which by the way is appreciated because

419
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I don't even know if anyone has heard the show until I see a comment by you show up.

420
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I kind of want people to go see the comments.

421
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And really, and be right there and ready to post.

422
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I don't know.

423
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm pretty sure that it's very simple to put that into place.

424
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Now, the resume will upload from mobile applications.

425
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah.

426
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Obviously, the best protocol, I guess, is FTP.

427
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I don't think it's trivial.

428
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You know, the way we set everything up.

429
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I don't know if it's simple and how that would work.

430
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But I'll certainly certainly look into it because I wouldn't want you to say fuck you.

431
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Adam, curry.

432
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I want you to say yo.

433
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Hey, Adam.

434
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This is Suzanne from the devicast.pacho.com.

435
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Adam.

436
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I have been itching itching to talk to you.

437
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The devicast just had the most riveting interview that I can just ever imagine.

438
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I wanted to share it with you.

439
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,000
We just interviewed Roland Haas, who has just come out with his book entitled Enter the Past

440
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Tense.

441
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
My secret life as a CIA assassin.

442
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Adam, I could not put this book down.

443
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I think you will find it so exciting.

444
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And he's very articulate and well spoken.

445
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
This book is just an absolute must read.

446
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
He's a must interview.

447
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You're going to be peeing green within being when you hear our show.

448
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So you have to go to the devicast.com.

449
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Show number 59 and take a listen.

450
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Adam, this is Robin, the producer for the devicast.

451
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I read the book too.

452
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And yeah, I had a hard time putting it down.

453
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Very hard time putting it down.

454
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I was over in Germany, flying the 810, right at the same time.

455
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Roland Haas was over in Germany doing his business.

456
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So it was right at the height of the Cold War.

457
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And this sort of filled in a lot of the interesting pieces that I was aware that it

458
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
was going on.

459
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But I, you know, I never knew exactly what was going on.

460
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It was a really cool book.

461
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And I think you'll enjoy it.

462
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And I think it'd be a great topic for you to ask your uncle about.

463
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah.

464
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
When you go see him because I'm sure he has some insights.

465
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I know he was on the other side of the world working in Korea.

466
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah, right.

467
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Definitely have some ideas and some inputs on some of these things that went on.

468
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So check it out.

469
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Thedevecast.com.

470
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You heard it here first.

471
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Adam.

472
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'll talk to you soon.

473
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Bye for now.

474
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You tease.

475
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
That's all you are.

476
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I know what's going on with you, Suzanne.

477
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Okay.

478
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Roland Haas.

479
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Cool.

480
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah.

481
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Amazon probably won't be able to get it to me before we leave.

482
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But yeah.

483
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Oh, man.

484
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I wonder if I can get it to the airport.

485
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That would be a good book to read before I talked to Uncle Don, which is.

486
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Oh, crap.

487
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Okay.

488
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Guys, thank you very much.

489
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm going to see if I can get a copy of it because I think it would be just perfect

490
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
homework for the big interview.

491
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And we haven't actually, you know, there's two things I want to do.

492
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
One is interview Uncle Don.

493
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It's a told you he worked for the CIA and he's now the president of the Korea Society.

494
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Very involved in all the negotiations with North Korea.

495
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But there's also, I recall when I was, I think 10 years old.

496
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We had a previous Korean family reunion and we buried a time capsule.

497
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And I remember, I distinctly remember where we buried it.

498
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And so it's at the place.

499
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's still at the homestead, if you will.

500
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And I think it's time to go dig it up.

501
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And I remember with, I discussed this my uncle Don and I think it was, I think it was probably

502
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
winter or something.

503
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
We said, you know what?

504
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
We'll dig it up on, you know, that Easter or whatever.

505
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And this is probably 10 years ago.

506
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
We just kept, you know, keep forgetting about it.

507
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But by now, this time capsule, I think has been in the ground for about 30 years.

508
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So I want to do a sound seeing tour of us digging it up kind of like an alcoholist vault.

509
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Seven, I guess, a staking place this weekend.

510
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Last night, everyone started arriving in Seattle.

511
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And fortunately, I can't be there this year.

512
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Of course, we do have a delegation from Pod Show up there.

513
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
up there, including our very unriched brewer hey from talent artist relations.

514
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Hey Adam, it's Richard Cohen, you have here from lovely Seattle.

515
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It is actually, let me think now, 10 o'clock for me.

516
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So six in the morning for you on it'll be parts.

517
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Fubah, hey, happy Fubah.

518
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I made it up here for Nondex, as you know, and it was actually kind of fun to get up here.

519
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't know if I told you the whole story behind it.

520
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But John DeForek and I talked a little bit about speaking with Chris Purello, you know, as you know, who puts on Nondex.

521
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I think he was actually the keynote here a couple of years ago.

522
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So 200.

523
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And John had said that he was flying up today, and that he wanted us to,

524
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I mean, sit down with Chris and talk about the possibility of Chris doing some cool things with Partio,

525
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
which I know Chris has been wanting to do for a while.

526
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I just haven't had a chance to connect with him.

527
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So I booked my flight and got my hotel, got a rental car.

528
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And I got an email from John about five o'clock yesterday afternoon saying,

529
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
the subject line was sorry for confusion.

530
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And then when I opened the email, it said,

531
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I think I might have said I was flying Thursday.

532
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm actually coming up Friday.

533
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
John.

534
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Thank you.

535
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So John doesn't have to get here to tomorrow,

536
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
which point I'll order to be flying back to HQ.

537
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So I managed to get with Chris on my own.

538
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And I heard a very good meeting.

539
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
He's just fine coordination over there at Pod Show.

540
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So you're up there without John, but the time John arrives, you'll be gone.

541
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I love it when it comes together.

542
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So I'm glad we had the meeting standing up.

543
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
He's a pretty animated guy.

544
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Let me tell you, as you know.

545
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Stop standing up.

546
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I got to see some interesting people on the opposite under the spectrum,

547
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
as in not animated at all.

548
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I did get to fly up with Steve Gilmore, which was a joy.

549
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Let me tell you.

550
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And then I also bumped into Brian Wall from cast fire.

551
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Cory Janice from my order was their usual folks at a Metz.

552
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I had a very good conversation with Chris Redlinger from GoDaddy.

553
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
She's been coming here ever since.

554
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
For quite a while, I see some sort.

555
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah, really.

556
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I've been putting it on.

557
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And then of course, the lovely Cali and the lovely meal together here in Seattle.

558
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
They've been driving all over the country by the sound of it.

559
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
They called me from the border of Canada coming back from Vancouver.

560
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And they were stuck through customs.

561
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
They had two and a half hours getting into the country.

562
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Uh-huh.

563
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
They just wanted to feed up Cali.

564
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I know how that goes at the border.

565
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
They actually watched them in time movie on their DVD player in the car as they were

566
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
waiting to come across the border.

567
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But we got to have a cocktail of two, as you know, Neil likes his general.

568
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
The only gin they had was beef eater, which was disappointed to him.

569
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So he had his vodka tonning.

570
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Um, HP sponsored the reception.

571
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And which was a good thing because they apparently had good taste and beer.

572
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
They, uh, they had the Alaska Amber available.

573
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So it was a good, uh, good reception.

574
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I was impressed at the number of people.

575
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I, you know, obviously, uh, who's who of, uh, dogs and geeks.

576
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I would have loved it.

577
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And, uh, I did.

578
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Um, and it looks like it's one of your great show.

579
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I was really amazed at the numbers.

580
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It was a packed house down there in the water.

581
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And I couldn't think of a better place to do it.

582
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's a lot warmer than expected.

583
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Women in San Francisco.

584
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That's your update, uh, from, uh, Seattle Pot Show.

585
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
All right.

586
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You got cut off.

587
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's exactly three minutes.

588
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
There is a time limit, you know, Richard, that I can allow you to call in.

589
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And he had another message he said.

590
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Oh, I got cut off.

591
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
All right.

592
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
There you go.

593
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You report from Nome Decks.

594
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I hope they're doing a live stream again this year.

595
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Because I do kind of enjoy that when there's conferences going on.

596
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You can kind of listen in, uh, and since, uh,

597
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Nome Decks is a single track conference, um, you know, you, you won't miss anything.

598
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So I hope they're doing a live stream.

599
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Think they're doing a live stream.

600
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Oh, so they're doing Parillo?

601
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Chris Parillo, um, I'm sure he will.

602
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yeah.

603
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
He does live stream when he's taken dump.

604
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So we made it.

605
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Expecting to do it from Nome Decks, Nome Decks.com.

606
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What were you on?

607
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Adam's first chin, I put.

608
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Yeah, I haven't done this one in a while.

609
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Let me just, uh, break out the old first generation I pod, you know,

610
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
the one with the really almost mechanical click wheel.

611
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And we take, you see, um,

612
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
God, I connected.

613
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Okay, we're going to give her a spin, I am going to put her on the summer playlist, see what comes off on Adam's first Jedi pop.

614
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
What's playin' on Adam's first Jedi pop?

615
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Oh, what's this?

616
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Can we guess it yet?

617
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It's a summer song, that's for sure.

618
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Oh yes, oh man, imagine the luck.

619
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Alright, this takes me back to 1974 and 75.

620
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Bobby Goldsboro, summer the first time.

621
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Hard afternoon, the last day of June, and the sun was a demon.

622
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:36,000
The clouds were afraid, one tin in the shade, and the pavement was steaming.

623
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I told Billy Ray in his red Chevrolet.

624
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I needed time for something.

625
00:35:48,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I was just walking by when I looked in her eyes and I swore it was waking.

626
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
She was 31 and I was 17.

627
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I knew nothing about love, she everything.

628
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I sat down beside her on her front porch.

629
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You wanted what?

630
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You're coming, that would be me.

631
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
The sun closed her eyes as it climbed in the skies.

632
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And it started to swell too.

633
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Sweat trickle down, the front of her gown.

634
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I thought it would melt too.

635
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
She threw back her hand, like I wasn't there.

636
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
She said, don't let you live.

637
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Her shoulders were bare, and I tried not to scare when I looked at her too.

638
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
When she looked at me, I heard her softly saying,

639
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I know you're young, you don't know what to do or say.

640
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I would stay with me until the sun's gone away.

641
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And I would chase the oil in you away.

642
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And then she smiled, then we talked for a while.

643
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Then we walked for a while to the sea.

644
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
We sat on the sand, and the more it took her hand.

645
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But I saw the sunrise as a man.

646
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I had made dinner, but whether I had heard it or not,

647
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Her muels were like a mont King.

648
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
When she looked at me, I heard her softly saying,

649
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I looked in her eyes, but the memory may go.

650
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I go back in my mind to the very first time,

651
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
in the touch of the finger.

652
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Was a hot afternoon, the last dear dream,

653
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
and the sun was at the end.

654
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I did a version of this song, got to play for you some time.

655
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I think it's probably even better than the original.

656
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
From my first generation iPod, Bobby Gullsboro,

657
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and some are the first time.

658
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Adam, I know you don't want me to call him from the car,

659
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
but I can't help it.

660
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm listening to the DSC number 647,

661
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
and you keep saying, foot and mouth disease.

662
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah.

663
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Coward don't have feet, it's hurt, and mouth disease.

664
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You're killing me.

665
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Hi.

666
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You can go in.

667
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Oh man, I'm telling you that over here,

668
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
they say foot and mouth disease.

669
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
That's what they say over here.

670
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I can't help it.

671
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I agree that it would be hoof,

672
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
because it doesn't look like a foot,

673
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
but they call it foot and mouth disease.

674
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Can't help you there.

675
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Third outbreak now registered near Gillford.

676
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It's going to be a mess.

677
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
This is really not good news.

678
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Tomorrow, if the weather holds up,

679
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and I haven't even told you how beautiful the weather is today.

680
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

681
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
The God has just given this to us.

682
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Thank you.

683
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Thank you, Lord, for this beautiful day.

684
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Give me another one tomorrow,

685
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
because I'm going to fly to Antwerp.

686
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's time for the 100 hour inspection,

687
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and maintenance on the Delta Sierra.

688
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So fly over hopefully.

689
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
If the weather's nice,

690
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
everything works out according to plan.

691
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I'll be able to do some helly flying tomorrow

692
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
with the wind commander.

693
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So don't look for me over the weekend.

694
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And, you know,

695
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
it wouldn't be a football Friday.

696
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
If we didn't have someone who's just so angry at Pod Show,

697
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and it'd me and it how football everything is.

698
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Adam Curry, this is the skipper from the boatvirtions.com,

699
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
which is hosted by Pod Show.

700
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I have addressed this issue with your tech support

701
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
more than I can count.

702
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I cannot fucking log in to my account,

703
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
and this keeps happening over and over again.

704
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
This is my final comment that I'm sending your tech support

705
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
on the Pod Show website.

706
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Message.

707
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
This is the last fucking time I will write in on this issue.

708
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I can't fucking log in.

709
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
How many fucking times do I have to get you to address this?

710
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I pride my password, it doesn't work.

711
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I get a new one sent to me, and it doesn't work either.

712
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
This is a continuing problem that you fucks won't fix.

713
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
How am I supposed to get to my podcast that you host to add to it?

714
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
To check my stats, to edit, etc.

715
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
If I can't fucking log in, why does this continue?

716
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And what are you going to do to primarily fix this?

717
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Adam, the last time I will call in,

718
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
the last time I will send a comment,

719
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and I will host my fucking website, my Podcast, somewhere else.

720
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I'll get it fixed.

721
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Oh man, I feel so bad.

722
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Ah, Skipper, don't worry, man.

723
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm sure it's just some anomalies.

724
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I haven't heard anyone else with this complaint.

725
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh, yep.

726
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But it's good to get it out of your system.

727
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
How many times did you tell them to fucking not fucking do this fucking thing?

728
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
When I awake in midnight,

729
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I lay in your shadow once again.

730
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I wonder where you have been.

731
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
If I'm secure to you.

732
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
For the size I greater,

733
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
why don't you come out and say your peace?

734
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And put my mind at ease.

735
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm waiting for you alone.

736
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Tell me you're wrong.

737
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Tell me that my fears have gone too far.

738
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Tell me that I've been here for a while.

739
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
You and I,

740
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
you and I,

741
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
just let it do now.

742
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So tell me that I'm wrong.

743
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Never say who I am.

744
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Why can't you tell me why.

745
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
The house in Christmas tree

746
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
would've hold you till he's gone.

747
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Run out of ways to save us

748
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Run out of ways to save my place

749
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Why are you just saving this?

750
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm trying to save my mind.

751
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Tell me I'm wrong.

752
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Tell me that my fears have gone too far.

753
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Tell me that I've made a role on your heart

754
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You and I as live as the two love

755
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Tell me that I'm wrong

756
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I've been wrong to think that you've got something more to say to me

757
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Which I need you still care as I know

758
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
You're true and hurts and you're a scene

759
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
You know, see inside my heart that your breath will never be

760
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
For the sun is a goal

761
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm sorry I was right

762
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Your spirit shakes me in my sleep

763
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
If I was wrong you'd be with me tonight

764
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I tell me I'm wrong

765
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Tell me that I've made a role on your heart

766
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You and I as live as the two love

767
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Tell me that I'm wrong to think that you've got something more to say

768
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I'm thinking I heard of this guy before when I saw him pop up on the podcast music network

769
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
His name is Nelson Bragg

770
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Turns out he also worked on Brian Wilson's

771
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Smile album that project that was in the works for like 30 years

772
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Nelson Bragg on the podcast music network tell me wrong

773
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Why didn't up to daily source code episode number 649 on a football Friday

774
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It's Friday

775
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday

776
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Food about Friday

777
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Adam's final fun your phone

778
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
We're going to make it really sweet into the point today

779
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Lady Bird

780
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I'm sorry the hell am I talking about

781
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Who barred

782
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I'm going to leave you with a quote of the day that I ran across

783
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I'm actually subscribed to this. It's the motivational quotes of the day RSS feed

784
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
This one's from Eleanor Roosevelt

785
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Fine

786
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Fine first lady

787
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Was that a first lady

788
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
All right here comes. I just like the quote forget about her you gain strength courage and confidence

789
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
By every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face

790
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
You are able to say to yourself I've lived through this horror

791
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I can take the next thing that comes along

792
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
You must do the thing you think you cannot do

793
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:13,000
All right 45 46 minutes perfect everybody Monday

794
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I'll be back remember we're traveling Wednesday

795

So you may not get a show then I'm not quite sure what time we're flying and
