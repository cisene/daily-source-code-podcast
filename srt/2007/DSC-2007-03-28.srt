1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And the beginning there was A.M. radio, families everywhere would gather around the living

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
room, listening to their favorite programs, and always good.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Who knows what he will look in the hearts of men, the shadow knows.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then came the advent of F.M. radio.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now broadcast could be heard in stereo, and teenagers found this, especially in tweaking,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
as rock and roll music could be heard with great clarity.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
However, parents became concerned as to what this music was doing to their kids.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now it's the 21st century, and satellite radio is all the rage, or is it?

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In a world where TV networks, movie studios, and record labels still think they can govern what you see in here.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses, and make big media corporations wet their tiny little pants.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
From Pod Show, home of the world's most dangerous new content comes the Daily Source Code with Adam Curry.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Delta, share a Charlie 571.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:30,140
I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it,

38
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,460
Did I love real?

39
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:54,980
I'm liking it. Almost part safe. It will be part safe for a couple of days. It

40
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,780
comes out officially on April 10th on eyeball records. New Atlantic a name of the band,

41
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,020
the wire and stone, the title of the song from the album, the streets, the sounds, and the

42
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,860
love. Hey everybody, how you doing? And it is daily source code episode 571 coming to you from

43
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:16,180
the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gilford on the west side from the curry manner. Ah boy,

44
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,980
despite it being another fantastic day. Actually aviation wise, not a super duper day. I think

45
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:29,380
there's limited visibility is still a lot of fog pretty high up. Doesn't matter. The November

46
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,420
277 Delta Shiro was not ready anyway to be ferryed over today. So hopefully that'll happen to

47
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:40,420
tomorrow. And of course it could happen Friday or even over the weekend. But I'm here. And

48
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,900
so I took advantage of a little bit of pre-production stuff I'd done. I thought I was going to take

49
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,260
advantage of it. After dropping Christina off at school this morning, to head on over to my favorite

50
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:58,660
store. Yeah. It's the PC, where not the PC, where the hell is it? You know, the computer store

51
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:06,580
essentially. I was so sick and tired of dealing with manky routers and the DSL modems and I was just

52
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:13,380
sick and tired of it. So I'm like, okay, I'm going to go buy the hottest shit, the best ADSL 2 plus router

53
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:21,860
or modem built in with wireless router. And I wound up choosing a net gear. I got to tell you,

54
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:28,020
I have never had as many problems with any products when it comes to wireless. This is, I mean,

55
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,900
it connected to the ADSL fine. But half the computers in the house can't even see the network. And I

56
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,500
have done everything you can imagine. I've reset it to default. I've set it to only talk to B and G,

57
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,940
based routers, not even deal with G plus and Mimo and N and N draft and Nino and all this crap.

58
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:55,540
Who fucked up Wi-Fi? Jesus Christ. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to take his name in vain. I'm just

59
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,620
excitable when it comes to crap like that. It was so simple. But this stuff supposed to be plug and play.

60
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,980
Because I figured, you know, this is going to be great. I'm going to have one of these routers

61
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,340
that knows how to automatically adjust its six internal antennas. Well, I guess even to have

62
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,380
it work backwards compatible, although it says so right on the box that'll work with G, regular G

63
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,620
access cards, which, of course, I have in all of my machines here. Half of them can't see it. The

64
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,020
max can't see the net gear and network. The Windows machine see it, but can't connect to it.

65
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,820
My Nokia internet tablet, the N800, it sees the net gear network. It won't connect to it.

66
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:39,940
So, um, and there you go. I went back to setting up the airport as in Bridge mode. And it's working,

67
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:46,740
although the speed is crap. I think it's, uh, it's really my location in retrospect to the

68
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,060
to the exchange. I'm barely getting a megabit per second right now. And that was on the wired

69
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:58,660
connection to the DSLR router. Hey, yeah, yeah. At least now when I pop open a video, it doesn't stop

70
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,500
and just keeps on playing. Yeah, even though I can tell that it's barely keeping ahead of the

71
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,740
the download speed is barely keeping ahead of the play speed. It is working. That's all I really

72
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,940
wanted because last night I was showing Patricia stuff on not her computer downstairs. And it was just

73
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:21,540
it was horrific. You know, and rebooting these things, uh, okay. If you have any idea why this net gear

74
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:27,460
thing, I mean, yeah, I probably should go get one of those USB plug-in things that will do the end

75
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,860
routing. But I just wanted it to work with everything that I had that was existing here. Yeah.

76
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:39,540
Uh, let me see. I did, uh, actually on this all comes on the heels of an email I received from

77
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:47,300
Basile, uh, Basile was telling me how to actually help me set up my airport. Um, and I have just the,

78
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,700
uh, what is it? The airport extreme, not the express, but the extreme. So that's with the silver

79
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:58,580
apple, uh, like the kind of alien. Yeah, the the the the bling apple logo on on on the housing.

80
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,220
So it's not the new end router or anything like that. Uh, and he helped me set it up so that that would

81
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,260
actually, um, connect directly through the ADSL modem. I know I don't know how to do it with this net gear.

82
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:14,820
So I put everything back to bridge mode. It seems to be working. Uh, if it'll stay consistent like this,

83
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,380
although I'd much rather be on the on the net gear router because these, uh, these airports,

84
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,580
um, they do have some kind of quirky things. And they do require some resets from time to time.

85
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,780
I just got to figure it out. Maybe a Basile will send me some more information on how to do that.

86
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,860
Some really cool that Jessica released is, um, a double ender. Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,540
Uh, Cali Lewis from a Geek Brief TV and Natalie Del Conti from texture. Did a double ender yesterday.

88
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:47,700
Mm. You know how I love the double enders. Um, so you can check it out. Geek Brief TV. It's the

89
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:54,900
most recent episode. Geek Brief dot TV. Geek Brief TV dot podshow dot com. Um, very nice, uh,

90
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,180
little discussion there. It's like, yeah, the network is coming alive. There's, you know, cross

91
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:08,180
promotion and I didn't have to get involved in any of it. Lovely. Lovely. So with the, um, how, you know,

92
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,660
none of these router issues are more or less getting sorted out, uh, a couple of the things I got

93
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:19,300
to, I still have to fix my, uh, my Gmail apps account. It's, uh, it's still not resolving

94
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,820
Curry dot com is bouncing email. Uh, it's just time. I just need time to sit down and call my friendly

95
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:31,140
Google representative to help me help walk me through it. Um, uh, I think what I did is I, I fuck something

96
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:39,300
up. Uh, I, uh, I configured my Google apps domain, uh, as mail dot curry dot com. And now, whatever I

97
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,980
want to, uh, configure the MX record, uh, I can't do that. I can configure the MX record for

98
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:51,140
Curry dot com, but not for mail dot curry dot com, or at least I don't know how to do it. So, uh,

99
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:58,180
help. Uh, uh, Dave Peterson did send me a, uh, a cool link. I'll put this one in the show notes.

100
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,340
Um, it's a nifty tool that helps you manage multiple Gmail addresses. It's a Firefox extension.

101
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,260
And so you can switch back and forth between accounts without having to log in log out or have

102
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,340
different accounts open on different tabs and it really integrates very cool. Dude, I appreciate that.

103
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:19,380
And, um, uh, we'll most certainly, uh, give that one a try. Uh, let me see. First caller of the day.

104
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,740
Yeah, it's got to be one of our buddies. Yeah, let's just call them a regular show. We got them

105
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,580
changed. Uh, just following up on one of the callers who are hanging about, uh, regular callers who

106
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:36,420
only being clear on the SC. I sort of consider myself a bit of a regular caller. I've heard my

107
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:42,100
voice on the podcast. Most things, but just to put them straight on something, I would see a good

108
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,540
50% of the stuff that I send you, you don't put on the podcast. And I'm not bothered. Um, because most

109
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:54,580
of it's bubbling, shite anyway. Um, so, you know, I'm just a random, no, I'm not sure if you

110
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:01,380
do. Um, if you ring in and it's interesting, I'm sure he will be cleared. Um, and this may not

111
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,340
get clear. Uh, well, give me a minute. Uh, no, no, James, absolutely. Yeah, it's true. James knows it.

112
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,180
There are lots of people know it. People send stuff in. I don't play it. I don't reply. It's like

113
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,140
a message received. You know, I get a lot of stuff. So, but it's definitely not the regular. There's

114
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,620
no such thing as a regular. The regular, those are people who actually send stuff that I can regularly

115
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:26,980
and now we're from our sponsor. It's the yanks versus the brits. Ooh, uh, we'll drive each other crazy,

116
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:34,900
but everybody knows that it's apparent to see that just like you and me, it's the yanks and the brits

117
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,700
to die. The yanks versus the brits. Mind the gap. Haven't done one of these in a long time.

118
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,740
Busco 9 a burks and this one in. And it's not an audio submission. It is purely in tech. So,

119
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,380
I'll have to take a stab at it. An Englishman was having coffee and croissants with butter and jam

120
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,340
in a cafe. When an American tour is chewing gum sat down next to him. The Englishman

121
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,060
politely ignored the American who nevertheless started up a conversation. The American snapped

122
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,100
the gum in his mouth and said, do you English folks eat the whole bread? The Englishman frowned

123
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,860
annoyed at being bothered during his breakfast and replied, yeah, that's of course we do.

124
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,980
The American blew a huge bubble. Well, we don't. In the States, we only eat what's inside.

125
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,700
The crusts, we collect in a container, recycle them, transform them into croissants,

126
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,900
or crescents, and sell them to England. The American had a smirk on his face. The Englishman

127
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,780
listened in silence. The American persisted. Do you eat jam with the bread?

128
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,500
Signing the Englishman replied, yes, cracking the gum between his teeth. The American said,

129
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,900
we don't. In the States, we eat fresh fruit for breakfast. We put all the peel, seeds,

130
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,620
and leftovers, and containers recycle them, transform them into jam, and sell it to England.

131
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:53,300
The Englishman then asked, do you have sex in the States? The Anxmild and said, yeah, of course we do.

132
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,060
The Englishman leaned closer to him and asked, what do you do with the condoms once you've

133
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,340
used them? We throw them away, of course, replied the American. Now was the Englishman's turn

134
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,780
to smile. We don't. In England, we put them into containers, recycle them, melt them down,

135
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,860
and transform them into chewing gum, and sell them to the States. That's why it's called

136
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,820
Rigly's. Now we're from Archbite here. It's the Yanks. Versus the Brits.

137
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:25,220
We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows that it's apparent to see.

138
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:33,060
Let's just like you and me, it's the Yanks. And the Brits. The Yanks. Versus the Brits.

139
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,820
Mind the Gat.

140
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:49,380
I had a prolific program right here again from San Francisco. I wanted to comment regarding

141
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:56,500
the comic strip bloggers, comment about 13 minutes into episode 569 of the Daily Source Code.

142
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:03,620
About the European Union, perhaps some history is an order. The European Union was originally

143
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:11,460
started as a steel community between the French, the Germans, the Italians, the Dutch, the Belgians,

144
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:17,780
and the Luxembourgians. I think they're called the guys from Luxembourg. As a result, you'll find

145
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:24,580
that all of the EU institutions are based in either France, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, or Italy,

146
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:32,900
or the Netherlands. Then England, in 1973, Ireland joined the same time.

147
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:43,140
And in 1992, the Massberg Treaty was signed in Holland, which established the currency union.

148
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,660
I really love this EU talk. It turns me on. This, of course, is all on the heels of comics

149
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:56,100
or blogger, bringing to our attention that the European economic community, I believe,

150
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,340
turned 50 last Sunday. It's all very confusing and we're trying to suss it out. But we have the

151
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:09,620
experts clearly on hand. Let's see what happens. What happened next was in 1999, the EU

152
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:17,300
expand in 1979. In 1970, the EU expanded again in 2010, Eastern European countries.

153
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,980
P.V. In prolific program, what you're doing to me, man? He sends me these

154
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:29,220
files. I love prolific program. He sends me these audio files. He sends him an AIFF format,

155
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,220
which means like 30 megs for one comment. Then this is what it's built up with. Okay,

156
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,660
let's back to our history lesson of the EU with prolific programmer.

157
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:45,140
Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and the Baltic States, which are a lot

158
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:54,260
we are doing in Estonia. In 2002, at midnight, the euro became a currency, not just the

159
00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:01,620
figment of the ECB's imagination. All right. I gotta go see if he has any more in the history lesson

160
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,500
that pertains. I should preview that. I didn't realize it was two and a half minutes. I'm sorry,

161
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,580
prolific programmer. Yeah, I'll play a jingle, make you feel good.

162
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,980
So prolific programmer is responding to comic strip bloggers comments about the EU and the

163
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:33,780
EEC. Then this guy from New York, who's a new regular caller to the show, he calls himself

164
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,660
Nylon because he travels piece from New York, lives in London, travels back and forth,

165
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:46,020
believes in the financial sector. He called in and I really want to play this first bit again for

166
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:51,380
you about the EU because I got a ton of responses to it. It's just unbelievable amount of responses

167
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,060
in, oh, I'll just give an example. This is from Devon Osterdorf. Adam at the risk of

168
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,380
defending all New Yorkers. The first time I heard Nylon's voice, I knew he was going to be annoying.

169
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,380
I think it's readily apparent that the guy does not get it. Perhaps if he pulled this head out of his

170
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,700
panty hose, he listened to what you say prior to making an asset himself on the show by blatantly

171
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,460
demonstrating his lack of comprehension. I really did not want to write this note as I'd like to keep my

172
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,780
input upbeat and positive, but I'm pleading with you to stop playing his comments. Unless, of course,

173
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,100
the Jeff Smith sends in something too priceless to let Gather dust on the shelf. Well, he didn't

174
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,820
call in today. Even though I did, I pleaded with him to please. I like it when people have

175
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:32,260
contrary in views. And it wasn't Jeff Smith, although Jeff did ping me, but it was slow.

176
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,580
Our buddy, Slough, who stepped up to the plate.

177
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,100
He's an island, outspoken, expatriate, he's in London, but he's from New York.

178
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,740
Let's listen to a little bit from Nylon. When he called in a couple

179
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,620
days ago. Hey, Adam, it's the Nylon, the New Yorker in London. No, I know you're in a little

180
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,900
budget there. You can't employ a fact-check, fact-checker. So a couple of corrections and then a final

181
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:14,260
word on bummerous detots. First, the reason why you probably don't know about the E.C. 50th is that

182
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,780
it's actually the European economic community that's somewhere in the 50th birthday. And that

183
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,300
consists of Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. It wasn't

184
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,580
sort of a master treaty. Dara, so you get it, right? Just him starting up a little bit. You can't

185
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:39,140
afford a fact-checker. Oh, he's an island, outspoken, expatriate, he's in London, but he's from New York.

186
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,940
Oh, man, I sure hope he calls in again.

187
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:53,140
It's a jingle extravaganza today.

188
00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:06,300
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip,

189
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:13,980
haia, Adam Kerry. Shouldn't we meet up in London soon or something? Any fucking way.

190
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:23,500
Let me correct, lay mass corrections of nylon. So, when I was studying at the University in Rome,

191
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:34,540
in Italy, then I was visiting Musei Capitolini in Piazza de Campidolio, where Roman treaties were

192
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:44,220
signed that created European economic community that morphed later into European Union.

193
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:53,500
So nylon is talking out of his ass, claiming that only funding members were celebrating 50th

194
00:19:54,060 --> 00:20:02,700
anniversary of EU. All member countries were celebrating it, including UK as one could see Tondibler,

195
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:11,420
there too. So nylon, shut the fuck up, a stick to issues that you know from personal experience,

196
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:20,220
like for example, jetting off in a toilet of virgin Atlantic airplane or something. By the way,

197
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:29,260
funding members, my ass, the all other worst races, the all, and only day are blocking freedom of

198
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:36,700
movement of work as the 2011. So it's clear we have to get nylon, comic strip,

199
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:44,940
blogger, and prolific programmer on one Skype call, one conference call. This would be fantastic.

200
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,260
Can you imagine the tower of Babel that would exist if we had the three of them on the phone

201
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,780
and we tried to figure out what the fuck the year is the European Union is?

202
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,980
Hi, Adam. This is Max from Hampshire in the UK. The nylon seemed to get very hung up about the

203
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:06,060
idea that there's a difference between us as in podcastes and us as in the audience. When the

204
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:13,500
thing I found with podcasting is it only takes half an idea and maybe a cheap headset and some

205
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,100
Skype call recording software and audacity and use pod shell will use various other services and

206
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:25,980
that's it. You switch from being audience to being podcast or even if it's only just your friends

207
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,420
that are listening in, then that's great. Your friends can tell their friends and so on and

208
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,500
difference between a large podcast and a small podcast is the number of people who are listening.

209
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:44,860
It's not like mainstream media like TV or radio where the big entities like the BBC or

210
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,780
Cleared Channel in the States or whoever have access and have reached a huge number of people

211
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:59,340
being seen as so wide ranging widely available now that it means anyone can listen to the

212
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,860
nonsense, bypass out the world structure tool. You press out or whatever it's a great big free

213
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:12,460
full and it's fantastic. Folder? Yes. Now I realize I played two comments out of order. I really

214
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,500
should have played this one because nylon did go on the talk about bombers that charred and how it

215
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:25,500
was all wrong and it wasn't a, you know, what did it prove and that was on the heels of his

216
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,700
EU comments. Mark was in Brussels at the time. Hey Adam, how's it going? My name is Mark. I'm

217
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:36,620
calling from London and I was calling in mainly about the European discussion you're having

218
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,740
yesterday about 50 years. Over the weekend I was in Brussels just by complete accident and

219
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:48,220
kind of an interesting. I had no idea that it was going on whatsoever and I guess in being

220
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,580
surprised I didn't seem to be talking about it that much. The other thing was, I just kind of felt

221
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,100
over there even in Brussels the whole thing kind of felt a bit lame. You know, they had simply red

222
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:04,780
playing some concert and some other sort of third-rate bands. It's really interesting. Simply red

223
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,180
Mick Hocknell. I think it's celebrated in most parts of the world. In the UK they laugh at it,

224
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:18,860
man. They call him a, what a ginger minger. I basically ugly red head and that's really strange.

225
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:23,980
Same with Phil Collins, man. They do not like Phil Collins here in the UK or something about

226
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,420
he had an affair with his nanny and then somehow his wife became the, the scorned woman. Well,

227
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,220
of course, she was the scorned woman. I presume, but he really got railed in the press for a long,

228
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,540
long time and people just don't give a shit about him anymore. That's really weird the way you guys

229
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:44,220
will just write off some, I think, very talented people. Um, and kind of the rest of the weekend,

230
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,100
I guess I was speaking with people and Brussels about the whole thing. And it kind of seems to me

231
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,900
that the one thing that they have as, maybe in Europe, as well, that there's kind of a lack of

232
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:00,140
understanding about what it actually feels like to be European, like an identity problem. So

233
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:07,500
that was my points and my question. I guess is, what does it, what does it mean to be European?

234
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:13,900
What does it feel like? What is the European way? So if anybody doesn't know about this, then yeah,

235
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,660
call them, let me know. But yeah, I love the show. Thanks a lot, bye.

236
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,380
Yeah, man. Thank you for calling in, appreciate it, Mark. Yeah, that is a very good question.

237
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:28,620
What does it feel like to be European? I think I have some inkling of an idea.

238
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:36,940
I feel somewhat European. I also feel, um, pretty American, really. I certainly don't feel

239
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,700
British. I don't know if I ever will be able to. But boy, I do love the culture here.

240
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:48,700
But that's a good question. Since this is a turning in to be, uh, or turning out to be such a,

241
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,500
a jingle-based show for everyone who's calling in the next call, or I don't have a jingle

242
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,860
for, but I was just looking for one. Hold on a second. This will be funny.

243
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,380
Hold on. I'm going into Napster as we speak.

244
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:15,500
Because the person is Luke. Now, you know Luke as the guy who delivers all the goods from Nokia,

245
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,700
yeah, we call him a, we call him a little bit something different here. We call him the candy man.

246
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,540
So I don't have a jingle, but I do have this for you, Luke. Hold on. Let's see if I can make it work.

247
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:29,820
Come on, Napster. Do your stuff. Buffer through that DSL gateway. Come on. You can do it.

248
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:37,260
Piece of shit. The f- just one song. It takes like six hours to download it. I hate this.

249
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,020
Huh, the podfather. I need connectivity and throughput. Better than this.

250
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:57,660
Hey, listen, I doubt plus four or four star-dash and I'm going to be more haste to not end it up here.

251
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:05,020
So that's working as well. Hey, just a quick update about the, you know, the Sahara sent

252
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:12,540
America and the charity run. So feeling sushi are still running. They are about, let's say, halfway

253
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,460
down the, down the list of contestants. So they're doing pretty well, going at every speed of about

254
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:26,620
five, five and a half to six kilometers per hour. And it should only eight contestants have dropped out so far.

255
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:34,780
So it seems to be going pretty well for everybody. Yeah, temperature yesterday was about 45 degrees centigrade,

256
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:43,740
which is, I think, 1520 on the Richter scale. So yeah, things are going fine.

257
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,540
And I'll call back later in a week when the racetrack over how everything went. Okay, bye.

258
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:54,780
All right, Luke. Thank you very much. Update from his friends who are doing a marathon every single day

259
00:26:54,780 --> 00:27:01,340
through the Sahara desert for a good cause. Frankly, Luke, I don't care what you talk about because you are the candy man, my friend.

260
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:25,900
Five, six, three, five, seven, one, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

261
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,900
Peter was going to kick my ass. I forgot the satellite window closed. Sorry, Peter was probably in some

262
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:37,420
tirade and rant that I was on. Luke is calling in from Zurich as we were talking about. I did make a mistake

263
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:44,220
about this plus thing in countries that do not use the GSM mobile protocol. And in the states,

264
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,340
that is quite a few places. You actually have to do the access code. Oh, one, one. It does that

265
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:55,500
suck or what? Now, I love America, but man, what's this worth 110 volts? What is this with

266
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:02,300
NTSC? You know, what is this with not using GSM? Like the rest of the bloody world?

267
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:10,300
Ah, here it's together. Hi Adam, it's Luke from Zurich. I just wanted to call it to say

268
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:16,460
it's written down an offer about roaming. When you received calls inside Switzerland,

269
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:25,020
with a pay as you go like you speak, pay things. You got money for giving a call. I mean,

270
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:32,300
that person who said to call pay decks or something. It's got pricing, much you can repeat.

271
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,140
When you call, I mean, this side of the call is not meant to be it.

272
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,980
By the sense, bye. All right, yeah, it is a rip off man. Whenever you leave the country,

273
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,900
whenever you go to a different country within Europe, you're paying for your inbound calls.

274
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:53,660
I don't think there's even any plans you can get that give you a blanket pricing for

275
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,020
for all countries and for roaming. And it can be quite high on the pre-pay funds. It's our

276
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:04,780
rate. It's like a pound fifty three dollars a minute if you can believe it. All right, this one submitted

00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:10,140
by David Sweeney from the Catholic Family podcast. Subject with the Gmail was outstanding new song

278
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:17,260
on the PMN. Well, that will catch my attention won't it? Getting assignments without your skill.

279
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:32,700
But if things I'm scared to say I'm not, then my mind I know all I can do is kiss you.

280
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,460
But I'm a copy between the curtain and the crowd.

281
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,460
And I don't leave cause I'm free to be alone.

282
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:50,460
But it doesn't even matter not all gone.

283
00:29:52,460 --> 00:30:02,460
All right, I'll sign up to find you when you look into my eyes, pay me your promise to me.

284
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:14,460
I'll just get without your skill. I'll just get out of your skill.

285
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,460
There's a picture in my bedroom by the window.

286
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:32,460
I don't sue kids just outside my closet door.

287
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,460
I don't know if I should run away or tiptoe.

288
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:44,460
But I feel like I can't be here anymore.

289
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:52,460
And I don't leave cause I'm free to be alone.

290
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:58,460
But it doesn't even matter not all gone.

291
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:12,460
All right, I'll sign up to find you when you look into my eyes, pay me your promise to me.

292
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:22,460
But I'll just get out of your skill. I'll just get out of your skill.

293
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:34,460
And make it sound so easy. To make them all so bright.

294
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:42,460
So when they come to me, they're dead.

295
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,460
And now they're still gone.

296
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:52,460
I don't leave cause I'm free to be alone.

297
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:58,460
But it doesn't even matter not all gone.

298
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:06,460
All right, I'll sign up to find you when you look into my eyes,

299
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:14,460
pay me your promise to me. I'll just get out of your skill.

300
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:22,460
Without your skill, I'll just get out of your skill.

301
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:34,460
Without your skill, without your skill.

302
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:40,460
Without your skill, I'll just get out of your skill.

303
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,460
Without your skill, I'll just get out of your skill.

304
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,460
That does sense your skills.

305
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:53,620
It's about to say goodbye when I noticed that one of my channels that updated at PodShow

306
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,620
Plus.

307
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,420
And we got to start talking about channels, just a reminder.

308
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:02,580
It's the channel that includes my digital flotsome podcast, not mine, but I feel like

309
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,020
it's mine because I've collected it.

310
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,540
It came to me, but it's from PWFentan, PEDA, the satellite repairman.

311
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,820
I alluded to this when I was in New York.

312
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:20,380
It got some horrible news, early morning, PEDA, let me know that his dad had passed away

313
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,260
quite suddenly.

314
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,940
And I met his dad in New York a year and a half before that.

315
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:33,500
And that's fucked up, it's like, whoa.

316
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,020
And I haven't said anything about it because obviously that's not my task and I wanted

317
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,900
to make sure that PEDA had his own way of telling everyone about that or not.

318
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:49,420
But I see now in the feed, it looks like his most recent show was a tribute to his dad.

319
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,620
So I'm going to stop the show now and I'm going to go listen to that.

320
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,620
And I suggest you do as well.

321
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,140
I'll put a link in the show notes, obviously.

322
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:03,540
And since some good vibes, PEDA was way, first whole family, his wife Rosiness, his

323
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,340
kids and grandkids and illegitimate children.

324
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,060
All right, everybody, dailysourceco.com for the show notes and links to everything we talked

325
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,060
