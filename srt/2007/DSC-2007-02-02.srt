1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,720
content in my ears.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,120
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,720
Alright, we're back.

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,360
Let's get you set up here.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,400
Okay, just just talking to here.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,540
Into this thing right here.

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,300
Yeah, because the microphone.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,300
What the...

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,300
Hello?

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,300
Hello?

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
No, no, no.

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,540
Grandpa, there's nobody on the other end talking to you.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,500
Oh my god, I thought this was like a ham radio back in the old me.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,540
It's not a ham radio, just say.

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,080
The DSC538.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,140
DSC, isn't that my vitamins are for God?

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,140
Yes.

19
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,140
Not a vitamin E, DSC just over the charlotte.

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,640
And Joel, it's at best, it'll be five bucks!

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,140
And what's the Daily Source Code 538?

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,140
5 Daily Source Code, what the?

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,140
Whatever, just get away.

24
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,640
Welcome to the DSC, 538.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Oh, football Friday, what did you say so?

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,140
It's football Friday!

27
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,140
I think I soiled my pants.

28
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,140
Baby me.

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,140
Don't you just make a man and slow it down.

30
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,140
There ain't no use in getting all worked up.

31
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,140
It's just a bump in the road.

32
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,140
We gonna work it out.

33
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,140
Yeah, I want you to get out of your eyes.

34
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,140
We could save something special.

35
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,140
I'll let it go.

36
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,140
I'll walk away from what we know is real.

37
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,140
Got to my dear love.

38
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,140
Gonna fight for love.

39
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,140
Pin down and let your shot it down.

40
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,140
There ain't no time all the time.

41
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,140
Baby, don't you just make a man and slow it down.

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,140
Yeah, you know I'm all the time.

43
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,140
Don't you just make a man and slow it down.

44
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:18,140
Baby, don't you just make a man and slow it down.

45
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,140
There ain't no time all the time.

46
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,140
Yeah, you know I'm all the time.

47
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,140
Yeah, you know I'm all the time.

48
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,140
Yeah, you know I'm all the time.

49
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,140

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,140
Yeah, you know I'm all the time.

53
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,140

Yeah, you know I'm all the time.

57
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,140
Yeah, you know I'm all the time.

58
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,140
Yeah, you know I'm all the time.

59
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:58,140
Yeah, you know I'm all the time.

60
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:16,140
Yeah, you know I'm all the time.

61
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,140
I love you, I love you, I love you

62
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,140
Baby, I love you, I love you

63
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,140
I love you, I love you

64
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,140
Baby, I love you

65
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:54,140
I love you, I love you

66
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,140
Oh, fight up

67
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,140
Gotta try, fall up

68
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,140
I love you, I love you, I love you

69
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,140
I love you, I love you, I love you

70
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,140
Baby, I love you, I love you

71
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,140
I love you, I love you

72
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,140
I love you, I love you

73
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,140
I love you, I love you

74
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,140
I love you, I love you

75
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,140
I love you, I love you

76
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,140
Oh, yeah, baby, that's the way to start off

77
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,140
You are right

78
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,140
I love you, I love you

79
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,140
That's the way we do it, that's the way we do it

80
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,140
That's suggested by Jersey Todd brand new heavies

81
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,140
From the Podset Music Network, all fired up

82
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,140
Kicking off your football Friday

83
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,140
What's the day?

84
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,140
Second of February 2007, coming to you from Curie Manor

85
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,140
It's the master of the manor

86
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,140
The name's Adam, how you doing everybody

87
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,140
Oh boy, technical problems this morning

88
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,140
Incernet was out

89
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,140
I thought it was something

90
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,140
Something in the network

91
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,140
I made a really smart decision

92
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,140
Instead of troubleshooting that

93
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,140
Before I had to do all my recording and productions this morning

94
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,140
I said, I'm going to stick that

95
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,140
Vodafone USB dongle

96
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,140
Into my Vios slot

97
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,140
And it only took me two restart

98
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,140
And it worked

99
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,140
So I was able to get my stuff from the PMN

100
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,140
And do my chip

101
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,140
Crapload of email you guys

102
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,140
It sent me

103
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,140
A lot of Trinity stuff

104
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,140
For free Trinity

105
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,140
And I think that we're going to have to start a

106
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,140
A secondary podcast

107
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,140
Fairly soon

108
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,140
We got the Google group up and running

109
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,140
Lots of people joining

110
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,140
More about that, of course, in today's

111
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,140
Daily Source Code

112
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,140
And of course, you will be hearing more from

113
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,140
Sir Jersey Todd later on

114
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,140
As the official musicologist

115
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,140
Of the Cha Cha

116
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,140
And it may be a little bit of a long show

117
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,140
I don't know

118
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,140
But I got to get out of here on time

119
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,140
Because to a clock

120
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,140
Pickin up the new car

121
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,140
Hi Adam

122
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,140
It's Josephine from Pod Finder UK

123
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,140
Now Adam

124
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,140
If you'd like to know what I'm wearing

125
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,140
All you have to do is check our episode

126
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,140
Two of Pod Finder

127
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,140
And I've got it on, just for you

128
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,140
Josephine

129
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,140
She's only been working with us for

130
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,140
Was this three episodes now?

131
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,140
Already she's totally on to me

132
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,140
You know how to get the promo's play, baby

133
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,140
Pod Finder UK.btpotshow.com

134
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,140
Hey, thanks to a couple of folks

135
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,140
So sending in their comments about

136
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,140
Sky, my, my Sky TV issues

137
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,140
Oh man, big fight with the teenager last night

138
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,140
Because of course, she had the only

139
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,140
Viewing card that worked

140
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,140
Well, you know, if you only have one viewing card

141
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,140
In the whole house, you're going to put that near

142
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,140
The family machine, right?

143
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,140
Holy moly

144
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,140
Anyway, so we were able to watch some television last night

145
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,140
Not like I'm really missing it

146
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,140
But channel 524 on my Sky box

147
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,140
Is wings discovery?

148
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,140
Oh god, I love that channel

149
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,140
That's like porn for me

150
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,140
Watching airplanes

151
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,140
Sydney

152
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
Sydney Bowel says

153
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,140
I work for Sky TV's big brother company

154
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,140
Direct TV

155
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,140
Sometimes the agents are asses

156
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,140
But they should not have charged you

157
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,140
If I'd handled the call, I would have sent you the

158
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,140
Shit to you next day air

159
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
No charge

160
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
Yeah, of course

161
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,140
You know, the UK, of course

162
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,140
Is not known for its customer service per se

163
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,140
Although I have to say, everyone's pretty polite

164
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,140
But I still can't get over the fact that I asked for a supervisor

165
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,140
And I couldn't get one

166
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,140
And it was like they never heard this question before

167
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,140
Which is quite maybe I'm asking for the wrong thing

168
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,140
Yanks, Brits

169
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,140
Yanks versus Brits help me out here

170
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,140
Uh, see, who is this from?

171
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
M

172
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,140
Shoot

173
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,140
I don't know who M is

174
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,140
Adam, your Sky problems

They will sort out your problems

182
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,140
Especially if you're spending money on HD

183
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,140
Multirume stuff

184
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,140
Yeah, I'll wait

185
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,140
Oh, if I haven't received anything by Monday

186
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,140
Then then there's going to be a lot on the moon

187
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,140
Adam, it's Barbara in Palo Alto

188
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,140
As you know, I am so jazzed about the Free Trinity project

189
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,140
More people are signing up for the Google Group all the time

190
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,140
And I am honored to be playing a part in getting this campaign rolling

191
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,140
Even though we haven't talked about what paths she's going to take across the USA

192
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,140
I have a feeling Trinity is going to be spending some time in Texas

193
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,140
And although I've never actually seen biodiesel fuel

194
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,140
I have seen cooking oil

195
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,140
So how about a song for Fubar Friday that puts it all together?

196
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,140
A song available on the Pod Safe Music Network

197
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,140
Called Sweet Texas Gold

198
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,140
Marby Adam, it's Friday

199
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,140
Happy to meet Trinity

200
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,140
And let's save the world

201
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,140
Come on

202
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,140
I love that

203
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,140
I maybe I just don't come on Friday as anymore

204
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,140
You guys send in the songs in the intro

205
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,140
Thanks Barbara

206
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,140
Perfect fit for Fubar Friday

207
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,140
We live the world

208
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,140
We live the world

209
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,140
We live the world

210
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,140
We live the world

211
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,140
We live the world

212
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,140
We live the world

213
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,140
We live the world

214
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,140
We live the world

215
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,140
We live the world

216
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,140
We live the world

217
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,140
We live the world

218
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,140
We live the world

219
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,140
We live the world

220
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,140
We live the world

221
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,140
We live the world

222
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,140
We live the world

223
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,140
We live the world

224
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,140
We live the world

225
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,140
We live the world

226
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,140
We live the world

227
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,140
We live the world

228
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,140
We live the world

229
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,140
We live the world

230
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,140
We live the world

231
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,140
We live the world

232
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,140
We live the world

233
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:43,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

234
00:10:43,140 --> 00:11:13,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

235
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:43,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

236
00:11:43,140 --> 00:12:13,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

237
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:31,380
WOW!!!

238
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,380
Here you go.

239
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:42,880
Straight forward, sweet taxes go!

240
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,880
not met yet other than through email, the free Trinity group,

241
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,880
but Google groups, and this comment that you sent in,

242
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,160
I like you already, if this is the kind of music you're into.

243
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,720
You know, I have ego filters set up at a techno-radi,

244
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,160
so if anything, and if anything is posted with Adam Curry

245
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,360
in it, or Pod Show, it shows up.

246
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,960
And from time to time, you'll read someone posting something

247
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,440
about MTV or how MTV used to be.

248
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,240
And in very briefly, there will be a comment about me,

249
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,720
Adam Curry, the fake head-banger ball dude.

250
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,440
And that's not all the time, but if it's ever about head-bangers ball,

251
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,840
they always rag on me, it's like,

252
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,760
I was so, I'm so into that music, and this straightforward,

253
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,200
that is certainly not the heaviest of the hardest

254
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,600
of all the hardest stuff that I like, if you know what I mean.

255
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,960
Hey, Google did something interesting.

256
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,120
They, I got to tell you, man, these guys,

257
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,800
they got their shit together.

258
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,240
I've been using Google notebook to, you know,

259
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,480
kind of as a quasi-outliner to keep track of mainly my show,

260
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,520
which is nice because it's then available anywhere.

261
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,360
Duh!

262
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,160
Not to mention the fact that our entire company seems to have just

263
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,160
devolged on Google Docs, man.

264
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,720
I tell you, there's something there.

265
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,440
It shows that people really use spreadsheets for,

266
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,840
I don't know, lists.

267
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,840
Yeah, the finance department,

268
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,400
user will spreadsheets, but oh, boy.

269
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,880
Anyway, they've revamped the Google notebook,

270
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
at least to show it up today.

271
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,800
Now, you can pop it out, pop out a window,

272
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,480
and it resizes neatly.

273
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,400
So now I can have Casplaster open,

274
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,000
I can have a couple other players open if I want to,

275
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,920
and I can literally size my Google notebook

276
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,360
to exactly where I want it to be.

277
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,960
So thank you, Google.

278
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,880
You've made my life even better.

279
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,680
And Google's not the only people I want to thank today.

280
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,280
My friend, Jeff Smith.

281
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,880
Our push people picks by Goli Goshik is a fine question.

282
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,840
Yes, it is.

283
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,880
Our push people picks.

284
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,400
You know, months go by, don't hear from the boy.

285
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,480
And then all of a sudden, he's all over the shit.

286
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,320
I love it, Jeff.

287
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,160
Thank you.

288
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,000
Our push people picks, this seems to be something that

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,200
people are very interested in hearing about.

290
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,440
Not from Jen, from Bucket, Adam.

291
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,600
Maybe the new question is,

292
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,640
our potty picks pristine in private.

293
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,440
Yeah, you know, it seems like we're really

294
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,040
onto something strange here that apparently,

295
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,200
people who work in very nice sophisticated workplaces

296
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,760
who have very good jobs,

297
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,840
who, for all intensive purposes,

298
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,760
are indeed proper pristine push people,

299
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,360
they trash toilets at work.

300
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,240
Yeah, Adam, James, Newcastle.

301
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,120
Ed, you know, I don't have you hit a roller.

302
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm not you.

303
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,320
There's this topic of tough people being horrible

304
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,400
and nasty and scummy, scummy,

305
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,040
and right to use them, no feast that you made to me.

306
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,280
It's really used not very nice.

307
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,560
And I, it's a bit of my life at work.

308
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,560
We share, building with around 15 sore luts.

309
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,000
And there's a few women, and we've got separate toilets

310
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
for females and males.

311
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,080
And the male toilet is just disgusting.

312
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,280
I don't know why men have to make themselves

313
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,800
sort of disgustingly, smelly and dirty,

314
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,360
you know, horrible, but I go in there.

315
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,680
I think it's the toilet myself,

316
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,360
and it's just piss off all over the floor.

317
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,520
If you're a kid, all over the toilet seat,

318
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,480
and this is a workplace we have people invited in

319
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,560
from the public.

320
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,760
We have representatives from all sorts of companies,

321
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,120
and we have representatives from Dell, Microsoft,

322
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,960
every year.

323
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,520
Even in it, they all come in this building

324
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,800
and they use the same leverage we do.

325
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,800
But it's not just that the toilets that people use

326
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,000
and our clubs and bars will pier.

327
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,480
I don't know why they're saying the rest of the company.

328
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,240
Well, actually, I'm lying.

329
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,640
I don't think so, I'll be in with a place.

330
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,960
And it's just as bad.

331
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,520
But men's toilets in the pubs and clubs

332
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,320
or if you need to take a dump in a place like this,

333
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,520
you're out of luck,

334
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,680
because there is no way you would put your ass cheeks on this seat

335
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
in some of these places.

336
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,320
They are a bismal.

337
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,480
And I just want to leave a mental picture in some of these minds.

338
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,800
Remember the film train spotting,

339
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,280
and you've got to see that if you haven't.

340
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,480
Okay, so, the time when you and McGregor have to fish

341
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,200
the toilets out of the toilet pool,

342
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,560
Dell, our mental picture in the night,

343
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,440
that was one, not exactly the final spot.

344
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,760
But that was a kind of toilet that I was in two weeks ago

345
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,160
in a pub in Durham, it was fantastic.

346
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,440
Yes, generally speaking, men are pigs

347
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,040
and I'm one and I'm ashamed of it.

348
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,320
I don't think it's possible, I just think it's men.

349
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,160
Just no bite.

350
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,880
James from Newcastle.

351
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,480
Thank you, James.

352
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,720
And maybe it is just men.

353
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,000
Let's explore this.

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,520
Women want to hear from you.

355
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,480
What are the women's laboratories look like?

356
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,400
You're a place of work.

357
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,800
I mean, pubs, that's a whole separate conversation,

358
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,240
which I think we can definitely get to.

359
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,960
But, is it just men who are pigs?

360
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,480
I travel a lot and I visit a lot of bathrooms in airports.

361
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,320
Let me tie you.

362
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,120
That's pretty much the train spotting vibe there as well.

363
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,680
I mean, besides all the noises coming out of those places.

364
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,360
But, yeah, what is it?

365
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,400
Is it just men or is it women?

366
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,160
Inquiring minds need to know.

367
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,600
Our posh people pay, spy, godly goshit is a fine question.

368
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Yes, it is.

369
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,160
Our posh people pay.

370
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,480
Well, I wish I could come up with a great quote that would live on forever.

371
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,960
I think I've got one.

372
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,800
People having sex is pornographic.

373
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,200
No, that doesn't sound right.

374
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,120
Well, isn't it just reality what we're seeing?

375
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,280
It doesn't everyone hope they're having sex like a porn star?

376
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,360
That's the last thing I want.

377
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,560
So here was the quote I hope makes it into the history books as being actually out of

378
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
curry.

379
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,880
Uh, excuse me, since I was glad I was doing this.

380
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,640
That's a pretty cool quote, isn't it?

381
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,200
Fuck me with a chainsaw, god damn it.

382
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,200
And I think I have a bit of a sniffle.

383
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,520
Do you talk funny?

384
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,920
It's funny.

385
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,440
That's why they call it talking funny.

386
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,640
Reality is funny, Rafi.

387
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,040
Adam and pod showed.com for all you warm goodness.

388
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Wait a minute.

389
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,240
Can we do this differently?

390
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
There we go.

391
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,840
OK, I'll try this way.

392
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,320
So Adam and pod showed.com is the email address to let go of all your doubt and self-loathing.

393
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,280
And you can find a pundit life and a great deal on a classic automobile at DailySourceco.com.

394
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Hey, everybody.

395
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

396
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Bye, bye.

397
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,280
Oh, crap.

398
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,280
That's a sander from the Netherlands.

399
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,000
Podcast Studio.NL, he's making some cool stuff.

400
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,480
And I'm not quite sure exactly what is Nietzsche's, but if I look at how successful Jeff Smith

401
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,160
has become creating jingles for everybody, then damn.

402
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,360
I think you want to get in touch with sander.

403
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,360
Podcast Studio.

404
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,720
If you're looking for something to be put together, that was his mixture of my quotes

405
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,160
that I want to go down in history as having said.

406
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,840
I really, you know, yesterday and another day, almost a full day with the tablet because

407
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,120
I did so many phone calls.

408
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,240
I emptied out the battery on the E61 around 11.30 last night.

409
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,120
I just did not stop at 8 for 20 minutes.

410
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,360
It was crazy.

411
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,480
And we got a lot of stuff going on.

412
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,960
We have a Nokia proposal do this afternoon in New York for free Trinity.

413
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,080
So I'm very excited about that.

414
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,000
And just I am such a fan of this N800 tablet.

415
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,120
I really am.

416
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,880
And it mainly because the open, you know what, I posted something on curie dot com the other

417
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
day.

418
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,920
Let me see if I can bring that up for you.

419
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,680
It was a link to, hold on.

420
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
It's just coming up.

421
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,600
You remember I'm on the, I'm still on the voter phone.

422
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,920
So it's a little bit slower.

423
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,720
Here we go.

424
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,280
Starry Hope 10 ways the Nokia 8800 is better than Apple's iPhone.

425
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,440
And it pretty much jived exactly with my feelings.

426
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,080
Let me just run to this real quickly.

427
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:27,200
First of all, price, Nokia 800 399 Apple iPhone 499 or 599 plus the two year singular

428
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
service contract.

429
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,400
Open source is 0.2.

430
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,000
Nokia 800 is a Linux device based on a modified version of Debian GNU Linux, which they call

431
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,120
the internet tablet OS 2007 edition.

432
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,520
The iPhone is far from open, which still not sure what Steve Jobs meant, where he said

433
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,840
the iPhone runs OS X.

434
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,080
I'm just paraphrasing obviously because these are much longer than I'm telling you.

435
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,320
Three third party applications.

436
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,640
Nokia strongly encourages third party developers to make software for their N800.

437
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,920
And that of course is where they have Mimo.org, Mike Alpha Echo, Mike Oscar.org.

438
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,120
Apple has stated they will not allow third party applications on the iPhone.

439
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,320
Or no service contract with singular needed.

440
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,800
Well, with the Nokia 800, you can access internet Wi-Fi via Bluetooth enabled mode, or with

441
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,480
a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone.

442
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,680
This allows you the freedom to use the mobile provider of your choosing.

443
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,040
To get an iPhone, you have to sign up for two year contract with singular.

444
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,720
I don't forget that this N800, it is a VoIP phone.

445
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,880
And sometime in this half of the year, from what I've read, there will be a Skype, a version

446
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,760
of Skype for the N800.

447
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,960
Well, that basically just turned your thing into a phone.

448
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,320
Five removable storage, Nokia 800 has two memory slots that support a range of memory cards,

449
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,600
SD, mini SD, micro SD, MMC, RS, MMC, and LMOP.

450
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,120
This allows you to keep one card in the device for more permanent storage and you still

451
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,040
have one on the front that you can interchange with your camera.

452
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,080
Apple's iPhone has no removable storage, probably design as it helps justify a higher price

453
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,640
model with more memory.

454
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Six, better audio and video codec support.

455
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,000
Yes, I'm down with that.

456
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,560
The N800 supports a wide range of audio and video formats, AAC, AMR, MP2, MP3, RA, Real Audio,

457
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:14,040
Wave, WMA, 3G, PAVI, H2263, MP1, MP4, Real Video, and Flash Video.

458
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,000
Although it's only Flash 7, now Flash 9 is on the way I understand.

459
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,680
The iPhone, like the iPod, plays only Apple's sanction audio and video formats.

460
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,440
This means you can play content from the item store as well as MP3 audio and MP3 files,

461
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,320
no streaming to the phone or playing competing formats and no flash.

462
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,960
On the browser, no flash either, I guess.

463
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,280
It's not a cell phone.

464
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,880
Now this is a big one because as I just said, it is an internet phone crap, how am I doing

465
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
on time?

466
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,880
What do we have?

467
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Shoot.

468
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
I'm glad I saw that.

469
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,440
I'll run through this for the serious people.

470
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,120
So it is a VoIP phone is number eight, number nine, webcam for video conferencing, and

471
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,240
number 10, and this is probably the best one.

472
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,720
It's available now, but I really like the open source nature of it.

473
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
That's what really does it for me.

474
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,920
Oh, I got an email here from, see, Daniel says, not sure if it'll run in the

475
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:14,400
Nokia, but I've been using Bash Potter, which works on Linux to automatically

476
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,320
a download podcast and it uses a shell script using WGET.

477
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
I'm going to install that.

478
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,880
That's a perfect project for this weekend, depending on the weather, of course, because

479
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,360
Captain Dan does want to do some training exercises with me.

480
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,840
And I'm, of course, I'm talking about flying the aircraft.

481
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
Hey, stars people.

482
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,440
I'll see you Monday, folks on the podcast.

483
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,640
I just still with me.

484
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,440
We're going to do some instrument training over the weekend.

485
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,280
Hey, you know, it is, of course, the daily source code Friday, Fubar edition, no Fubar

486
00:24:42,280 --> 00:25:11,040
edition is complete without surgeers, he died.

487
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,680
Hey, what's up, Adam, it's Jersey Todd on your Fubar Friday and you know, when I think

488
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,200
about it on a Fubar Friday, baby, you need to get Fubar beyond all recognition.

489
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,520
And I'm proud to bring to you with, with what I think is her long overdue DSC debut,

490
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Jesse Moss.

491
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,320
Yeah, Jesse's open for Missy Elliott.

492
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,640
She's been recorded with Cypress Hill and she's finally making her way to the daily

493
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
source code.

494
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,880
This one's going to get you moving on a Fubar Friday.

495
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,280
It's Jesse Moss with sinking drinking fits.

496
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Check this out.

497
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,280
Gotta find another way to make my day.

498
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,800
Hey, be it so, but it's gotta be more than it.

499
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,360
So enough to stay out the piss, gotta be more as well.

500
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,360
And fish, gotta be more to sink in drinking, fish, I see it.

501
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,840
I've been lucky, but won't count, but as it's too busy countin' empty, sat down the floor

502
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,600
in the ball and I'm far from the feet with everything I got, gotta stop now for a ride.

503
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,320
So I do now away with your best friend and to see it go, like to say, no get bored of myself

504
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,760
feel like everything so, but I ain't a winner, I'm Aussie.

505
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,280
Hey, haven't you remembered just too, to apologize too, and you know, it's lies

506
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,880
when I say I won't do it again, so win.

507
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,600
Dear friend, no weather is good, I should put this bottle down and step that side.

508
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,600
And a minute and I'll just one more sip, one for the road on second floor.

509
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,560
This is working out, I'm Aussie, right here.

510
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,320
I just have one more sip, please hear cheese and cheese and bravery now where we are.

511
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,440
Oh, yep, that's right there, put this bottle down and step that side.

512
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,560
And one sec, there's the teller phone, that's cum to ladder, friend is calling.

513
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,200
Be just brain-run, not to just turn out and soar.

514
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,160
What's next though, yes, that the door we go, I'll just find my shoes, that's somewhere.

515
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,320
Hello, what's this next to my sock?

516
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,280
A tea plane, a lot of Irish thoughts go back to women.

517
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,400
Listen joyously, I, yes, lovely, it's funny.

518
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,520
People say when I was getting a tooth, I'm not sure what to do.

519
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,000
I'll know my skin dark, I will, today's a bedroom, stay in sight.

520
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,960
I was weird, so I'm not still waiting to make a lie.

521
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:30,960
For recovery, I've been knocked out and can't steal, I'm still waiting to make a lie.

522
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,960
Got the little me, I was weird, so I'm not still waiting to make a lie.

523
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:46,960
For recovery, I've been knocked out and can't steal, I'm still waiting to make a lie.

524
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Got the little me, I'm still waiting to make my day.

525
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:04,960
For recovery, I've been knocked out and can't steal, I'm still waiting to make a lie.

526
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,960
I was weird, so I'm not still waiting to make a lie.

527
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,960
For recovery, I've been knocked out and can't steal, I'm still waiting to make a lie.

528
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Got the little me, I was weird, so I'm not still waiting to make a lie.

529
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:34,960
For recovery, I've been knocked out and can't steal, I'm still waiting to make a lie.

530
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,960
Got the little me, I'm still waiting to make a lie.

531
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,960
That's definitely different to Sir Todd.

532
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Jersey Moss, Death Jersey Moss, Jesse Moss.

533
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,960
On the pod save music network, I checked by the way, yesterday about black malicious.

534
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:58,960
They're on tour right now, and those are their current songs from their live DVD, which they're promoting, so it may total sense.

535
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:06,960
Before I forget about the Nokia, I just want to say one thing.

536
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
What?

537
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,960
Excuse me, Finland, hello.

538
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Let me see if I can do this.

539
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
I think I can do this.

540
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Hello, Finland.

541
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
Hello, Finland, Finland.

542
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,960
Pay attention, calling out to Finland.

543
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Can't let me get the reverb back there.

544
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:35,960
What idiot engineer decided that all new Nokia phones have to have these little, itty, little tiny, like little power plugs?

545
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,960
This is the stupidest, design decision I have seen in years.

546
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,960
I have gone through three adapters now, because here's what happens.

547
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
You have to see this thing.

548
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
If you have a Nokia phone, you have an older model.

549
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,960
You know, there's a plug that goes in the bottom, it's just a straight jack.

550
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
What would you call it?

551
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Is that like not an RCA?

552
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,960
It's just like a power, but like on every single adapter in the world.

553
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:06,960
For some reason, Nokia has decided that all their new phones, at least all the new ones I've seen, have this little, it's like an ant dick.

554
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:14,960
And this ant dick plug is so fragile that, you know, I love to, I have my phone next to my bed in the condo.

555
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,960
I don't have any phones here at home next to our bed, because I figure, if you're calling the middle of night, I can't help you anyway.

556
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,960
So don't weigh me up.

557
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,960
No matter what's going on, I might as well get a good night's sleep for whatever tragedy is struck.

558
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,960
However, when I'm in San Francisco, I got the girls here.

559
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
There's an eight hour time difference.

560
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
So I have the phone next to me on the nightstand.

561
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,960
And of course, you know, I reach overnight, you know, getting some water or something, or, you know,

562
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,960
sometimes the phone falls off the nightstand.

563
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,960
It's not a big drop, and it's carpeted, so the phone's fine.

564
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:53,960
If it falls right on that plug, cushion app, and dick broken, you know, if you, if you pick up the phone and it's still plugged in,

565
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,960
of course, this is what Apple solved with their magnetic power plug.

566
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,960
You know, with the old model, you know, the, the plug would just jerk right out.

567
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,960
With the new model, you break another ant dick, and it's all over the world, our client for this, my friends.

568
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Really, really don't understand that.

569
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,960
For those of you just joining the daily source code, I have an automobile, her name is Trinity.

570
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:29,960
She's a, egg non-colored, egg non-yellow colored Mercedes station wagon turbo diesel 300 TD from 1984 with five cylinders running on biodiesel.

571
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,960
And we're sending her on the road starting in San Francisco, California.

572
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,960
She's going to go all the way across the United States with a little bit of luxury continue around through Europe.

573
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,960
Excuse me, we haven't talked about this yet, but she could actually go all the way around the world, you know.

574
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,960
She's been fixed up, everything, I think she's been fixed up, I'm still waiting for Rosie to call in.

575
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Rosie, thanks for listening to the show.

576
00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:01,960
And Alexander, members looking for his lyrics for a great Trinity song the other day, he resented to me, ah, you dear boy, thank you.

577
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Let's greet her nipples and fuel her bits, this four-wheeled lady who's full of tricks from the pimps of petrol, set us free.

578
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,960
So let's oil her up and free Trinity, you'll listen to the daily source code.

579
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Dear, thank you.

580
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Exxon mobile, $40 billion in profit. Again, I'm not against those guys making profit because they have to reinvest all those billions for the next 50 years of getting oil out of mother earth.

581
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,960
And it's going to be very difficult, very expensive and look, we can make a difference.

582
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,960
You know, how many how many people can suck oil out of one restaurant? That's probably a good question.

583
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:57,960
So if I'm just a regular driver commuter and I'm making biodiesel or someone's making it for me and we're getting it from a local restaurant, how much does a restaurant produce?

584
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Ah, these are questions.

585
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,960
The lady love has been sending openings for the daily source code for the past couple of weeks. He sent in two today. The one you heard with grandpa at the top of the show.

586
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,960
Of course, from the lady love from love house radio, the daddy cast and here's another one he sent in.

587
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,960
And if material story about a man named Curry, always smoking dope to, he's never in a hurry.

588
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Said, by these who is the place ought to be, so by twist to faith, he found Trinity, vegetable cooking it.

589
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:36,960
It's not like french fries. Well, next thing you know, the old cars breaking down, maybe it's because Adam never is around.

590
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,960
We've got our old fix, whatever reason, maybe, and they started a looping call for each entity worldwide.

591
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
Joy ride.

592
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,960
So now everybody wants to take your first spin, the biodiesel project has started once again.

593
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,960
To hear more about this realist who's a car, listen to the show because we're going to beef you more.

594
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,960
DSC 538, who are Friday.

595
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Thank you, PD. Fantastic man.

596
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Yep. Let's just roll on a little bit of an update as we get ready for the weekend.

597
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Shall we?

598
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,960
You know, Jeff Smith, man, you are so talented.

599
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,960
I've got to make songs that you just want to sing along to. Can't help it.

600
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:51,960
Cassandra is trying to find a suitable replacement for Trinity at the condo in San Francisco.

601
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,960
And a lot of people have emailed in about this and there's some threads on the Google group, which you can find a link to in the show.

602
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,960
No, it's a daily source code dot com. But if you're familiar with Google groups, it's groups dot google dot com slash free Trinity.

603
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:11,960
And I got to kind of parse through the whole Google groups thing. It's a little bit different than Yahoo groups, so working on it.

604
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
I'll spend some time this weekend.

605
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,960
You know, people are saying, ah, you should get one of those hybrid jobbies.

606
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Yeah, the Toyota Prius or Prius or however you pronounce it.

607
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Yeah, I'd rather walk quite honestly than drive one of those, although they are extremely popular in eco friendly.

608
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
But I don't like that.

609
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,960
Dave from New York, who was kindly offered to pivot Trinity out with the Astro turf, which might be the way to go once she hits New York.

610
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,960
I also sent me some pictures of some mockups of licensed plates, vanity plates.

611
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Trinity, biodiesel, and a photo shop of what Trinity will look like with when she's decked out an Astro turf.

612
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Dave, I think it's good if we can get it to New York, you know?

613
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Let's see.

614
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Ah, my calls have been answered.

615
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Hey Adam, this is Craig Meyer calling. I'm the guy who a couple years ago did that pro code on the map to do the pro

616
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,960
pro potter for you or the cast, catcher or put out a root call that's right on me.

617
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,960
I got your call about wanting a Frapper map interface.

618
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:22,960
And I have a friend here, a Brit, who just got laid off by her company, who's very interested in doing such an application.

619
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,960
In fact, he already has one done because he's playing the driver across the country in his, the leech to the vet would is.

620
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,960
And, but the same software could be used to track your Trinity trip and he's working on exactly what you want,

621
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:43,960
which is to have a web interface to have people post in sites of interest so you can plan a trip.

622
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:51,960
I will send you email so that you get his name and with a little more information that I just wanted to let you know.

623
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,960
Take care Adam. Good job. Bye.

624
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Dude, thanks. Good to have you back in focus and thank you very much.

625
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,960
I've already seen some comments on the the free Trinity Google group about that.

626
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,960
Again, this weekend when I really have time to sit down and have no other crap on my mind.

627
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,960
I'll just go through this and I think we have a community, my friends.

628
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Clearly, we've got something going. There's like 40 people signed up now.

629
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,960
So sick freed from the Netherlands who, amazing sick freed's able to reach me,

630
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,960
but yet this week the gossip rags in the Netherlands are full of stories about how I have,

631
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,960
I'm on the run from creditors.

632
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,960
I didn't see that hard to get a hold of me. Adam just catching up on DSC's.

633
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Love the idea about free Trinity. In my day job, I'm an organic search consultant.

634
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
I'm not a podcaster. I really want to help.

635
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,960
In short, I do search engine marketing. Wouldn't be a great idea to set up a total website around free Trinity.

636
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Well, we're going to set that up. It's going to be a profile page on Podshow Plus.

637
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,960
Your help would be greatly appreciated.

638
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,960
The search engine optimization is, that's quite a job, man.

639
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,960
It's like an art. It's not even a science. We got a couple people doing it now.

640
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:03,960
We're working on our feeds. We've changed some things now, so that you get better search results and iTunes.

641
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,960
But it is truly an art form. You need some specialists for it.

642
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
So it would be awesome to have you on board, buddy.

643
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,960
I guess anywhere the biodiesel shows up as a search result.

644
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
We want to link to Trinity.

645
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,960
Hey, Adam, Kenny from Northern California, checking in on the Trinity issue.

646
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,960
Do you have $200 for a battery? You got host.

647
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,960
I did. I know I got totally shafted on that one. What can you do?

648
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
And it wasn't even broken.

649
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,960
But of course, it went to the Mercedes dealer. What do you expect?

650
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,960
You know, I love Trinity, but Mercedes, blow me.

651
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,960
Hi, Adam. This is Reed and DC with a biodiesel question.

652
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,960
A question is, as people start using other oils, modified oils for cooking.

653
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Let's say oils that don't have trans fats like Burger King is going to do.

654
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Or oils that are actually not oils at all, but other synthetics that are being developed.

655
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,960
They haven't zero calories and so on.

656
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,960
As they start using those, what's going to happen to the use of that oil in the biodiesel industry?

657
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Does zero trans fat oils still have potential to be diesel fuel?

658
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,960
What about some of those synthetic that are not really oils that you can still cook with?

659
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,960
What if getting the waste products from a fast food restaurant is going to turn out to have problems?

660
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,960
Because you can't burn the fuel.

661
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,960
I appreciate it. And the listeners know the answer to the question.

662
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
Thanks. Bye-bye.

663
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,960
You know, it's a good question. I think the answer is you can pretty much do anything.

664
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
You can poop in our tank and it'll probably work.

665
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,960
At least if it's not less than a quarter full because of the crushed gas tank currently.

666
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
The fuel doesn't flow.

667
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Now I think that is very interesting and that might be a good PR angle.

668
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,960
I'll spin up a conversation on the free Trinity Google Group.

669
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Wouldn't it be interesting now that trans fat is in the news so much lately?

670
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,960
I don't see why it wouldn't be able to use trans fat.

671
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Refine it and use it as biodiesel.

672
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,960
I think it'll work perfectly and that is something the press loves.

673
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,960
They love to pick up on something with a new angle.

674
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,960
It's all looking to that but I'm pretty sure the answer is going to be yes.

675
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,960
Hey Adam, it's stuck from Germany. It's been a long time since I called it.

676
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,960
It's stuck from Germany.

677
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
It's kind of behind on my chat chat.

678
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,960
It's just listened to 531.

679
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,960
It's just calling it about the...

680
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Sorry, I'm driving.

681
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,960
It's just calling it about the free Trinity and the comment that the gentleman was talking about

682
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,960
with going on a road trip with his son.

683
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,960
I think that's an awesome idea and it actually got me thinking.

684
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Much fodder is retiring in a couple of months and I think we got some work in

685
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,960
going along trip with him somewhere.

686
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
It's a driver cross.

687
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,960
Oh no, he's so disrespectful.

688
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,960
Anyway, I thought it was really inspiring and actually we had a loss in the family recently.

689
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:14,960
It was called the whole family and I've been looking for a good excuse to do something

690
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,960
with my parents and find them with my daughters a great idea.

691
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,960
That's the power podcast we made.

692
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,960
Keep it up and y'all be catching up.

693
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,960
I was looking into an audio book and it was really good.

694
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,960
But bad part is it's like far behind on podcasts.

695
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,960
All right, take care.

696
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
Bye.

697
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,960
I'm a thank-ass beautiful.

698
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,960
It really is and I think we'll we'll see more stories like this.

699
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,960
This is Trinity makes her trek around the world starting in San Francisco, California.

700
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,960
I think we'll see people bonding on these trips and I'm very jealous of you because obviously

701
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
I can't make a trip like that with my mom anymore.

702
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,960
I don't think my dad and I can quite bond in that way anymore.

703
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,960
I don't know.

704
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
But it's a beautiful idea man.

705
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,960
And I hope Trinity makes a stop near you so you could maybe make part of that trip

706
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
as a part of the free Trinity project.

707
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,960
All right.

708
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,960
Again, the Google Group is groups.google.com free Trinity.

709
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,960
They're the world wind viable prizes indeed.

710
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,960
Okay, I got one more song for you, a special recording before that.

711
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,960
I just wanted to mention, yes, I was pissed yesterday.

712
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:42,960
You know, we are without a doubt one of the major forces online for godaddy.com, one of our sponsors.

713
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,960
And we have signed up so many new customers for them.

714
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,960
And we have a really good relationship with them.

715
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,960
And you know, godaddy is pretty famous for it's a very sexy Super Bowl commercials

716
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,960
with the current raining godaddy girl.

717
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
Oh, I got a reminder.

718
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,960
Next week to tell you about godaddy girl, UK.

719
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,960
And you know, so, and they're always getting banned or, you know, CBS won't play

720
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
I'm during the Super Bowl.

721
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,960
You know, it's like, you know, and there's a couple of them up online.

722
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,960
I think if you go to Bob Parsons.com, he points to to two commercials.

723
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,960
One like a Sharon Stone channel kind of where the godaddy girl sits there and she's being

724
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,960
interrogated and she uncrosses her legs.

725
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,960
It's like very hot.

726
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,960
Definitely something CBS would not air.

727
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
But our totally loved it.

728
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,960
It was very, very sexual.

729
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,960
Now, so I did know, partially through the internal grapevine that Paul

730
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Tuddle, senior and junior from Orange County choppers.

731
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,960
We're going to be in the new in the new commercial.

732
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,960
And I knew that it was coming and it was going to be fun and sexy and whatever.

733
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,960
And they go daddy released a like a mini mini portion almost like the beginning of

734
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,960
the commercial.

735
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,960
And you know, you see a door open and it's like, I like a nano second.

736
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,960
You see some chicks dancing in the background.

737
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,960
I'm like, so I talked to the sales we said, dude, can we get like some real footage?

738
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,960
Because that would be cool.

739
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,960
So I asked this last week yesterday.

740
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,960
Some new member who just signed up to pod shows,

741
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,960
sneak peak dot pod show dot com.

742
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,960
That's sneak s n e a k p e e k dot pod show dot com.

743
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,960
Excuse me.

744
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,960
He signed up and has put up a video, which is clearly edited by go daddy.

745
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
So it existed within the go daddy organization.

746
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,960
And he's put it up on, I guess it's a he.

747
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,960
You know, is it has put it up on on his on his profile page.

748
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,960
And it's awesome.

749
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,960
If you want to see some of the behind the scenes footage from go daddy,

750
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,960
then you can see it there.

751
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,960
I'm just, I'm just pissed because I want to really roll it out as a big network wide thing.

752
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,960
But it's okay.

753
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,960
So the sneak peak dude is it's clearly on on the tip of getting cool shit from the internet video.

754
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,960
I see you might want to check that out.

755
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,960
Link, of course, in the show notes, a deadly source code dot com.

756
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,960
Hey, Adam, my care from fish ball acoustic.

757
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,960
Just wanted to let you know that the latest episode of the fish ball acoustic podcast is out.

758
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,960
At fishball acoustic dot btpot show dot com.

759
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,960
And this one features a live recording of the shakes doing a totally acoustic set.

760
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,960
Just two acoustic guitars and vocals and a bit of tambourine and and and muracas and so on.

761
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,960
It was a fantastic evening.

762
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,960
The guys played really well.

763
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,960
You will hear on this podcast a versions of the shakes songs that you will never heard before.

764
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Totally stripped back and just really, really good.

765
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,960
Now I'm going to give you a taste of this by sending you a track from the set.

766
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,960
This is an acoustic version of I want a better life, which is their new single.

767
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,960
And it sounds completely different to the single.

768
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,960
But to my mind, it's just as good as I say.

769
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,960
If anybody wants to check this out, go along to fishball acoustic dot btpot show dot com.

770
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,960
And you'll find the whole set there.

771
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,960
And we've got an interview with the lads on there as well.

772
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,960
So some good stuff in there.

773
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,960
Anyway, tailwinds.

774
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,960
Say yeah.

775
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,960
Oh, you're pilot.

776
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,960
I know you're new to the network, but you do realize if you're not a pilot, you can't actually use tailwinds.

777
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,960
You have to use some other salutation.

778
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,960
Yeah, I love those shakes guys.

779
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,960
Liberty Jones, of course, played the crap out of that one.

780
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,960
I want to bet our life is really, really grown on me.

781
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,960
First time I saw them perform it was at the podcast con UK.

782
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,960
And they also are on.

783
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,960
I think the the pre not right now.

784
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,960
Dr. Cockney is on who's on it.

785
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,960
But the previous episode of who's on it with O.J.

786
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,960
O.J. Borge.

787
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,960
Who's on it?

788
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,960
That pod show dot com who's on dot btpot show dot com.

789
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,960
He has the shakes playing on toy instruments.

790
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,960
You got to see it.

791
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,960
But this, of course, is the live acoustic recording that you just heard about.

792
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,960
I think you're going to like it.

793
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
Thanks for having us.

794
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,960
Go to the curry house there.

795
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,960
Like the curry house.

796
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,960
Just down the road.

797
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,960
We haven't tried it.

798
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,960
Try it because it's good.

799
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,960
You live it.

800
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,960
So you can probably have it.

801
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,960
Yeah.

802
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,960
What's your problem?

803
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,960
No, no, it's play.

804
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,960
This next song is our next single.

805
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,960
It's coming April.

806
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,960
Yeah, so we're quite excited about it.

807
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,960
And it's the tune called I want to bet our life.

808
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,960
I want to bet our life.

809
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,960
I want to bet our life.

810
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,960
Morgan these four worlds.

811
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,960
I'm my loving wife.

812
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,960
I want to bet our life.

813
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,960
And I want to be your man.

814
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,960
I want to be your man.

815
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:08,960
Because you pretend you want to be your man.

816
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,960
Oh, does it tell where you want?

817
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,960
Oh, does it tell where you want?

818
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,960
Oh, does it tell where you want?

819
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,960
Does it tell where you want?

820
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,960
And I want to bet your life.

821
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,960
I want to bet your life.

822
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,960
Just like the one before.

823
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,960
Only faster I want to bet your life.

824
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,960
And I want to run the show.

825
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,960
And I want to run the show.

826
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,960
You're confirm on everyone.

827
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,960
I want to run the show.

828
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,960
Oh, does it tell where you want?

829
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,960
Oh, does it tell where you want?

830
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,960
Oh, does it tell where you want?

831
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,960
Does it tell where you want?

832
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,960
Oh, does it tell where you want?

833
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,960
I want to bet our life.

834
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,960
Oh, does it tell where you want?

835
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,960
Does it tell where you want?

836
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,960
The shakes lie in an unleashed eye-want a better life.

837
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,960
We'd love to hear from y'all.

838
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
You know the number but now I hope.

839
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,960
In the UK.

840
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,960
And that'll do it.

841
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,960
I hope you guys have a fantastic weekend.

842
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,960
As I said, I'm going to do a bit of spot of flying if we can.

843
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,960
And just chill out.

844
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,960
Have yourselves a great one.

845
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,960
Don't do anything.

846
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,960
I wouldn't do, which of course leaves the universe wide open.

847
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,960
The source code dot com for the show notes.

848
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,960

849
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,960
Another podshow podcast.

850
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
Stick it in your ear.
