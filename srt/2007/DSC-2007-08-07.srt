00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey home fries, it's CC Chapman from accident hash, encouraging you to check out botod.tv slash battle.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's one of the coolest battle events out there, and you can only find it at botod.tv.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's the DSC 647, which actually stands for the Daily Source Code 647.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But you can also say the Delta Sierra Charlie 647, but you can't say tailwind unless you're a pilot.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Of course, some people just shorten it with the Charlie 647, but that just doesn't sound right.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So here's the DSC 647.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, but really, I think we should look at that analogy.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's look at the road being the network, road system, and let's look at cars.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Cars being the devices you connect to the road, and you use the road with to travel across it.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yep, if there was just one car that would work for everybody, we'd have to be what I'll be driving Volkswagen.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In a world where TV networks, movie studios and record labels still think they can govern what you see in here.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses and make big media corporations wet their tiny little pants.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:35,000
From Pod Show, pole of the world's most dangerous new content comes the Daily Source Code with Adam Curry.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I think you better stop.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I think you might have hit the switch bar.

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, it's a crazy lot.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That sort of thing just blows my head off.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Here we are, thumbs up.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Here we are, thumbs up and I'll get our car.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Here we are, thumbs up.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Here we get what's right and what's up.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I knew we were right from the start.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But all you're struggling, you ain't very small hearts.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But you got a lot of hearts.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You might want to keep those new things in your heart.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Here we are, thumbs up.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Here we are, thumbs up and I'll get our car.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Here we are, thumbs up.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Here we get what's right and what's not right.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Getting good, way better.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No more feeling of it.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Can you update my legs there?

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Just don't want to go over there.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Here we are, thumbs up.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Here we are, thumbs up and I'll get our car.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Here we are, thumbs up.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Here we get what's right and what's not right.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Here we are, thumbs up.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Here we are, thumbs up and I'll get our car.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Here we are, thumbs up.

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Here we are, thumbs up.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Just spot safe and you'll find the link to her at dailysourcecode.com.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Jericho all thumbs up, kickin' off daily sourcecode episode number 647.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Again, a beautiful, beautiful day.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Summer has finally arrived.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I know, I'm inviting the book in the end by saying this,

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
but I'm upstairs here in the attic.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I've got the windows wide open.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can hear the birds outside.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There's almost no wind at all.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Beautiful blue sky with some nice white puffy clouds.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Which I'm sure will come back to haunt us a little bit later on in the week.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And for those of you who are interested,

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm wearing my Al Jazeera Bathrobe today.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't ask, just trust me.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's not actually, it's not an Al Jazeera Bathrobe.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I stole it from the Bourgella Rob hotel and Dubai.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But I called my Al Jazeera Bathrobe because it has one of those logos on it.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because it was late last night.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I didn't get into bed until I think it was 145, probably sleep around 2am.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Just up late talking to San Francisco.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The alarm went at 715 this morning.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
As it does every Tuesday morning because it's time to take out the trash.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh shoot.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You know what?

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm just thinking about that.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I wonder if,

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
well man, I wish I could find that song.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Was that that they might be giant song?

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Take out the trash?

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That's probably why I like it so much.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I've always had to take out the trash my entire life.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It was way was my main chore growing up.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And for a while there, I didn't have to do it.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You know, we had staff and everything.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
When I have to admit, I got kind of tired of the staff.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's much less aggravating to take out the trash yourself once a week.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And I can't take it out at night because the foxes and God knows what else is around here.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Get into it and they they tear up the bags and it's all over the street.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And that's no good.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And that's just kind of rude.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Anyway, today, going to talk about music, pod safe music,

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
or music in general actually.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah, the first article that came across my desk this morning is

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
an article in the inquire, the inquire, not the inquire.

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And that's a, I think that that's a British publication, right?

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And they're basically recounting a story that wired uncovered that sound exchange.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Now, this is the organization that is collecting royalties from web casting.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And from other online use of licensed music of mainstream licensed music, I should say.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Apparently, these guys are engaging in illegal activity.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh, gee, who would have thunk it?

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
A wide magazine found that sound exchange registered the music first coalition dot or

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
domain name, May 9th, 2007, and is a founding member of this PR and

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
lobby group, which of course is a PR and lobby group for the mainstream labels.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It also supports music first financially.

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The music first coalition is a public relations outfit who's job is to

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
be a sound recording performance royalty on terrestrial radio stations.

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's one.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And of course, they do all the, what is it now?

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
They want to collect money for performers and they want to collect money from web streamers.

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's interesting, let me just go to the wired story because that's actually,

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I guess, the source of this is that's not allowed under the auspices of how

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
they're set up.

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I think there's only three main directives that sound exchange as a,

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
what do you call it as, as the,

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm a loss for words today.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Anyway, it's a compulsory license.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So that means it's law, which means the collector of this compulsory license fee

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
has to appear to certain laws according to wired, section 14,

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
G3 of the copyright act explicitly limits how the nonprofit, which is sound exchange,

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
can spend the money it collects,

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
approving just three carefully circumscribed activities.

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll just give those to you.

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So the administration of the collection distribution and calculation of the royalties.

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Makes sense.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The settlement of disputes relating to the collection and calculation of the royalties.

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And the licensing and enforcement of rights with respect to making of,

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
uh, a femoral recordings and performances subject to licensing blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So, uh, they're doing some G.

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Isn't that amazing that they're doing something illegal, doing something to only

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
who of themselves?

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm telling you, people, for those of you still fighting this,

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
stop fighting, go around it.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's just not worth it.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Listen to what we're doing.

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Adam, Dave from South Florida.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Amen.

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Carbon leaves.

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You're playing carbon leaves.

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I love it.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I absolutely love it.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
See, this is what I'm talking about.

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I love these guys.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I've seen them tons of times.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And I forget this guy's name who, uh,

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
who got this, this, uh, them on the network,

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
but man, holy shit.

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's awesome to hear a band like this, uh, on the network.

142
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I've been following these guys for years.

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Parted with them, um, like I said, seen them a ton of times.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Great group of guys.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Really cool to see a band like this on the network.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So, uh, congratulations on this one, man.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This is huge for you guys.

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
All right.

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Take it easy.

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, congratulations to you.

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You seem to be really excited about it.

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And other people who've been listening to the song,

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
it's really for the audience.

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You know, Pod Show makes no money out of this.

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
In fact, it's, uh, it's really, it's a cost center,

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
because it, uh, it gives us a great resource for programming.

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And not just Pod Show, but, uh, anyone who wants to sign up, uh,

158
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
for the Pod Take Music license, which you can do with the network.

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I should give you the address.

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's music.podshow.com.

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And if you just want to listen to some of these tunes,

162
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and you don't want to join the network, uh,

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
don't have a show.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's okay.

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Go to podshow.com slash music.

166
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And you'll get exactly the same little more, uh,

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
consumer friendly, uh, with some players.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You can embed on your own webpage, etc.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And you can search, uh, similar and topless.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And all kinds of get Ruby.

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You can get them, by the way.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You can put them into a channel, uh, which will play in the

173
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
mashboard, etc.

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Um, uh, uh, but really, you know, the, uh, the, uh,

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
the point being that it's working.

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I got a call just before starting, uh,

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
the show this morning.

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Super agent Keith called me.

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He said he spoke to the guy over at Cafe Nero.

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Remember now, I'm trying to expand the Pod Take Music platform, uh,

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
uh, by getting music, uh, Pod Take Music played in the 360 Cafe

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Nero's currently in the UK.

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Soon to be branching out across Europe.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I'm pretty sure that eventually one day they'll give it a try in the

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
States.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't see whether they wouldn't.

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Um, and, um, so Peter Ettenger is the guy, the managing director

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and he's the guy that I spoke with and met with and that he,

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
he spoke with, he's on holiday this week.

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But he called super agent Keith from his holiday location and said,

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
dude, uh, I'm like blown away by this stuff.

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I definitely want to do something.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So haven't spoken to him myself, haven't heard it with my own ears,

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
but I would say that that's a, uh, that's a big up right there.

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
God, how cool would that be?

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
How incredibly cool.

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If we could, uh, play Pod Take Music, uh,

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
get Pod Take Music played in, uh, in retail outlets,

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
but also have the, the actual CDs available for sale there.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm telling you, it would be so huge.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And, and what a big, you know, two fingers up to the mainstream

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
establishment.

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah, listen, what's happening?

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Remember I played, um, the song I think this is war by Stephen P.

205
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Richards, which was, uh, suggested by, uh, by listener.

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, here's what happens.

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Hey, Adam, this is Stephen Richards, um,

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
on the song writer.

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You play this song on mine.

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This is war on your show last week.

211
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Just want to call him personally.

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Thank you for that.

213
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I really, really appreciate it.

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I've been trying to get that, um,

215
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
song out there and start pitching it on.

216
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And, um, it's been kind of difficult in the US as you can imagine

217
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
with the political sort of climate here.

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But, um, I just wanted to let you know.

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It also got picked up on another pod show,

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the, uh, galmin show, my turner.

221
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And so, um, I really, really, really appreciate that.

222
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So thank you very much.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And hope you have a good week.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Hope you all will dry over there.

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And, um, take care.

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Bye-bye.

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, Stephen Dome, man.

228
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Thank you.

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Thanks for sharing.

230
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And, uh, nowhere.

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Well, we're keeping a dry, but it's still pretty bad.

232
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Uh, the flooding.

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And, uh, and of course, this is summer.

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's flooding in the summer.

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Not only that, but now gulfard has a second outbreak of, uh,

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the, uh, foot and mouth disease, which I should just tell you briefly,

237
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
because I've, you know, I've, uh, paid attention to this over the, over the past

238
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
what, seven years probably, uh, where there have been some huge outbreaks

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and, uh, and major calling, which is a different word for killing of animals.

240
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And, and maybe I should just explain, because a lot of people get confused

241
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and, and compare this like mad cow disease, which it is not.

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
In fact, foot and mouth disease, as far as I know, is curable.

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Uh, and, uh, you know, you can cure the animals of this disease.

244
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Uh, if you eat a, uh, foot and mouth disease infected, uh, animals,

245
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
you will not die as a human being.

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You will also not contract foot and mouth disease.

247
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Uh, in fact, back in the day, it was like, hey, man, uh,

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
you know, my cattle got foot and mouth disease.

249
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Ah, shit, man, we'll stay away from your place for a couple of weeks,

250
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
because it does end.

251
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It, you know, these animals don't die from foot and mouth disease.

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The problem.

253
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The problem is you cannot export any meat that has been contaminated

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
with foot and mouth disease.

255
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So the industry is, is completely out of standstill.

256
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No cattle is moving whatsoever, because it's really about the export of the meat.

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Uh, I think there's some European regulations, maybe you can about the sale of it.

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But it's not like it's going to kill anybody.

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This is purely about business.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I just want you to understand that.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And, you can't wax it.

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, you can actually, you can vaccinate, uh, against foot and mouth disease.

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But then you also can't export the meat because vaccines typically

264
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
consist of the disease itself.

265
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So they would still test positive for foot and mouth disease.

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And that's just not acceptable, uh, in meat trade apparently.

267
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So, you know, all these animals, which, by the way, would have been killed anyway

268
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
to be eaten, uh, are being killed.

269
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think quite senselessly, just because the industry, uh, can't, you know,

270
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
can't handle, uh, a couple of weeks of standstill.

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And, uh, and I, as I said yesterday, the industry is completely subsidized.

272
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So just subsidized it's a more, you know,

273
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and, uh, and let's not kill these animals senselessly.

274
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's my, um, as my position based upon what I know.

275
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Of course, I could be wrong, and I'm sure we'll have some veterinarians

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
to bounce calling in, at least I hope so.

277
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Dylan Alford, uh, one of a couple of people who sent me, uh,

278
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
some feedback about that, uh, about the newspaper postings from Luke Air Force

279
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
base that I read out yesterday, um, about, uh,

280
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
one letter that was written into local newspaper saying,

281
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
hey, what's all this with the, you know, disturbing our shopping morning at the mall,

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and it turns out it was a formation fly by for a, uh,

283
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
for a burial of, uh, of an airman.

284
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And a couple of people have sent me some backup on that.

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
First of all, the story is from 2005, which kind of pisses me off,

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
because, you know, I guess it must have been still circulating around the net,

287
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
or maybe just now kind of popped up, but it was presented to me as something new.

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Uh, and there is additional information, which I feel I need to,

289
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
need to read out to you.

290
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Um, after, uh, lieutenant, uh, Colonel Scott Blues sent back, you know,

291
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
uh, also sent in his letter saying, hey, you know, uh,

292
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
shut the F up because these guys are flying information for a fallen airman.

293
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Then, uh, the original writer of the original letter, Tom McRae, uh,

294
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
sent this to the letter, which was posted as well,

295
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
regarding fly by honoring fallen comrade, comrade.

296
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I read with increasing embarrassment and humility,

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
the response to my unfortunate letter to the republic, as the newspaper,

298
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
concerning an air force fly by, quote, a wake-up call from Luke's

299
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
jets letters on June 23rd.

300
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I had no idea the significance of the fly by,

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and we never have insulted such a fine and respectful display had I known.

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I've received many calls from fine from the fine airman who are serving,

303
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
or have served at Luke, and I've attempted to explain my side,

304
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and apologize for any discomfort my letter is caused.

305
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It was simply an un-informed citizen complaining about noise.

306
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I've been made aware of both written and verbal communications of the four,

307
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
of the four ship fly by.

308
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And my heart goes out to each and every law serviceman and woman in this

309
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
war in which we are engaged.

310
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I have been called un-American by an unknown caller,

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and I feel that I must address that.

312
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I served in the U.S. Navy and Amoviet now veteran.

313
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I love my country and respect the jobs that service organizations are doing.

314
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Please accept my heartfelt apologies.

315
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay, so now that's taken care of.

316
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So I guess everybody jumped to conclusions on that one.

317
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And even worse, I'm only delving into it and jumping to my own conclusions

318
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
only two years later.

319
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I need to get away.

320
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Which is, hope it's happening.

321
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Next Wednesday, we're going to the States.

322
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We still don't have a beach house to sit in,

323
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
but we're going for the big,

324
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and I heard about your family reunion and interviewing your uncle.

325
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Very much looking forward to that.

326
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You had me excited when you talked about it earlier.

327
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Very, very cool stuff.

328
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Can't wait to hear that interview.

329
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Speaking of great interviews,

330
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
David Epolito, that guitarman from Central Park is working on an idea

331
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
with the sit burnstein, the man responsible for bringing

332
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
not only the Beatles, but the Rolling Stones

333
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and the Raskos and many, many other bands from England

334
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
into the US.

335
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So you did point your finger and say that's

336
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
the man responsible for the British invasion,

337
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
said burnstein would be that man.

338
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
David has posted on, I love the video,

339
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
a brief interview that he did with said,

340
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
he's working to expand that and wants your input.

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He could get in contact with him, that'd be cool.

342
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But check it out at time.

343
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I love the video.

344
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I think it's sil,

345
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
cv.pro.

346
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Or you can go to that guitarman.com,

347
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
get the link from there.

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Very, very cool stuff.

349
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Anyway, tick here.

350
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Talk to you later.

351
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yep.

352
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Indeed.

353
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So first of all,

354
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
uh,

355
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
yeah, Uncle Don, that's what it was.

356
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, I'm looking forward to that as well.

357
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
He's the CEO of the Korea Society,

358
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
very involved in the, in the recent

359
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
conversation slash negotiations,

360
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and we'll get his worldview.

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I think it'll be, it'll probably be a very long interview

362
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
that I'm going to break into multiple parts,

363
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
and maybe we'll follow it over a week or something like that.

364
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And that's why I'm hoping for the beach house,

365
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
the beach house got to have Wi-Fi,

366
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
so I can sit there and edit and do some cool stuff.

367
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And my trunks, you know what I'm saying?

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And regarding said burnstein,

369
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
David and I've been talking about this for several months,

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and I did see the video, it's it's Itv.pto.com.

371
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I love the video.

372
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And here's what I was thinking because,

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
you know, yes,

374
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
sin burnstein responsible for bringing the rolling stones

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and the Beatles and the British invasion,

376
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and for a number of other things that I've

377
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
nothing to do with the British invasion.

378
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But of course, you know,

379
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
lots of people were really responsible.

380
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I mean, you know,

381
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
you could say that the Beatles were responsible

382
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
in part as the stones were themselves.

383
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But what is important about said is he has ears

384
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
and this is something that's really,

385
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,640
you can't learn, you have the talent, and you know how to identify a song that's

386
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,920
going to resonate, you know how to hear hits, and it doesn't go away, you can continue

387
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,800
to hear this throughout your life, as far as I'm concerned. I can still do it, and

388
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,520
I'm still pretty good at it, as Sid Bernstein, of course, is an expert. So what I'd

389
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,880
like to do, if you see that video, it's kind of shot in like a lunchroom cafeteria vibe,

390
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,120
really noisy, and you don't really get the intimate feeling that you want from Sid. I mean,

391
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,160
I don't even think we have to do video. I would just like to run, you know, five songs

392
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,360
a week by Sid Bernstein from the Pod Safe Music Network. See what he says, you know, see

393
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,640
if he can pick him, or maybe, you know, let him listen to 20 songs and haven't picked

394
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,880
his top three favorites, the ones that he thinks will make it. That's the kind of show I want

395
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,520
to do with Sid Bernstein, because that would be obviously a humongous seal of approval.

396
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,920
Adam, what's going on? A scary Alexander from the Ultimate Pod Test.

397
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,960
A scary Alexander by the way, starting to become an official savant of the show. I just

398
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,000
wanted to play this feedback, because he's got something pretty cool going on. He's got a

399
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,160
got a new show that he wants to promote. Thanks, first of all, I have a new show called The

400
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:17,240
Combat Zone. You can find that at thecomasone.podshow.com. It's an all video show. I go into

401
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:24,600
Jim's here around the country, and hopefully soon around the world, and interview fighters

402
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:31,640
as well as cutting men, trainers, nutrition experts. If you see all that on the combat zone,

403
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:38,280
and I just did a show that you're going to be excited about with Gina Corrano, who is a super hot

404
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:46,120
fighter that's by my show time. And wow, such a smart girl, as well as beautiful and

405
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:52,840
talented, and we'll kick your ass. Now moving on, I'm currently in production of another show,

406
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,840
being in Vegas here, I've been out of my show last show that I've done for a couple of months,

407
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:05,160
actually about five months here, and I've kind of sat around and gotten heavy. I've got on

408
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:14,200
about 25 pounds, 20 pounds, maybe, and I am in the process of losing weight. Thank goodness,

409
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,920
and I'm going to drop about 25 to 30 pounds, and I'm going to do that specifically through

410
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,160
martial arts training, through boxing, through kick boxing, and we tied you just to,

411
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,640
and mix martial arts training. You're going to see as you go to the new diet, you got to the

412
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,760
interviews with nutritionist, you know, to interviews with with personal trainers,

413
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,960
everything's going to be on this show, and it's going to be all video. So every average show out there

414
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,280
will be able to come to the show, get pointers for workouts as well as nutrition stuff,

415
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,480
and you'll learn about a sport that I know enough really nothing about yet. Which brings me to my

416
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,760
last point. I want everyone to vote for my show. It's been a category called no one understands

417
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,440
my sport. All right. All right. Dude, you are just cranking them out, and I can't wait to see

418
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,960
some of those episodes because they're perfect for the plus. I know I've spoken about this just

419
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,640
just touched on it from time to time, the plus TV, which could very well become a home page for

420
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:20,840
pod show you never know. We set up a video stream. It's like a video station, it streams in real

421
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:29,160
time, and it's programmed. So that means that we, you know, basically I wanted to create an MTV

422
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,600
of short video clips, some of it being music, not all of it, and I think we're succeeding. The plus

423
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,240
TV, I can't tell you where to find it, but the plus TV is definitely something you might want to

424
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,840
check out. We're still in like alpha phase, the stream goes up and down, and you know, there's

425
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,800
playlists and stuff that up next that that sometimes breaks, but when you see this thing work

426
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,280
perfectly, the plus TV can't tell you how to find it. I think you'll really enjoy it. If you do

427
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:03,880
find it, let me know. Also, yesterday worked on getting the free Trinity production up and running a

428
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:11,560
little bit. You know, we found a Shane and AB bugby who are more than willing to use Trinity on their

429
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,480
here at the wheel. You can find more about them at year at the wheel.podshow.com. They'll be doing

430
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,280
audio and video in this very important election year, traveling around the United States. They have a

431
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:28,600
root all mapped out. We have to start filling that root up with, well, basically places where they

432
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,040
can stay, or places where they can score some biodiesel, or maybe just some old veggie oil and

433
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,400
take it over to someone else's place and turn it into biodiesel. And my hope had been that I could

434
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,520
get one of the originators of the idea, Doug Pilgrim and his son still involved, and I receive this,

435
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,960
I think about a week ago. Hey, Adam, it's Doug Pilgrim in Boston. I want to preference this call

436
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,280
in here. Brock and I have really gotten a kick out of watching this idea. Take off and morph into

437
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:02,760
so many different directions, and to come to where it finally is now with a year at the wheel.

438
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,680
I'm very, he thinks it's very, very cool and so do I. But I am afraid the window of opportunity

439
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,920
for Brock and I to be involved with this project has come to a close. Brock has taken a job

440
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:21,080
as of last week, down in South Boston on the docks, and he's working on a ship repair down there,

441
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:28,360
and he'll be working that job 12 hours a day, seven days a week, from now until he goes back to the

442
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:36,200
academy, which is good for him, because it's a type of job that he wanted to do. And Kendall,

443
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,840
Brock's sister, who's just about to get her driver's license, and who was going to be his second

444
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:47,080
on this trip. Now has a full-time job. She's also doing volunteer work at the local hospital.

445
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:54,440
At the same time, she's taken a prep class for her SATs. So unfortunately, her time is all used up,

446
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:02,920
and I have now taken on a second job also to make ends meet. Just your average American family.

447
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:10,360
So unfortunately, we're not going to have the time to be able to participate, and which is too bad.

448
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,080
I also think it's important that Amy and Shane have a clean slate to start off their project,

449
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,280
and so that they aren't shackled with any of the preconceptions of what this project was all about.

450
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,000
And in that spirit, I have to say, free Trinity is dead, long live a year at the wheel.

451
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,880
So anyway, thanks for including us in all this atom, and I am now formally retired from this project,

452
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,000
but I just want to tell you that I've enjoyed the ride. I will go back to the Pilgrim Think Tank,

453
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,440
and come up with the next new idea. I'll be listening, and I'll talk you later on. Thanks.

454
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,200
Bye-bye.

455
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,440
So a couple of things about that. First of all, a true American. Listen to this.

456
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,400
A true American family. Listen to that. And Doug, dude, do I know what it means to have two jobs?

457
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:57,000
I have two. I got two on both sides of the Atlantic, other sides of the earth.

458
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:05,640
But what a lovely family. And everyone doing stuff, and working hard, and I feel really sad on the other hand

459
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,640
that you guys can't participate in the project, and I still want to do something somehow,

460
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,240
even if it's just Trinity coming by to visit you guys. I mean, I just feel kind of crappy about it,

461
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:21,400
but I really do appreciate the understanding. And let's get Trinity on the road, and I appreciate

462
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:30,600
your further support, obviously. It's warming up here. You know, if I close the door to the attic,

463
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,800
there's nothing that will help the heat just kind of hovering, hovering above my head,

464
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,480
very hard to get rid of it, and starting to heat up already. I got one more subvant that I

465
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,680
want you to listen to. A atomic rod is back with an update. Of course, a atomic rod is a gentleman who

466
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:50,520
fully believes that a lot of the answers to our climate issues, but certainly our fuel

467
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:59,400
and power issues, could be solved by backyard atomic reactors. And you know me, I would love

468
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,960
nothing more than the plant one of those puppies in my backyard. Adam, it's atomic rod,

469
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,240
Adams, your energy, savant. Did you miss me? I haven't had much time for listening, or calling

470
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,520
in recent, I understand your challenge and putting out your daily shows. Time gets away from me

471
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,200
when you're trying to run a growing company. We're just having a lot of some updates on the

472
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,400
atomic world. You might have heard the numerous scary press reports about the effects of a recent

473
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:29,320
earthquake off the coast of Japan that infamous water that was discharged into the ocean was

474
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:36,920
almost exactly as radioactive as orange juice. I have some ideas about whether mainstream media

475
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
gave it so much attention. Repetition of a slanted event description is one way to obscure the truth.

476
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,200
You know, I'm sure that somewhere someone started by releasing the horrible story of this radioactive

477
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,280
waste, but I wouldn't blame the mainstream media. All they do is just sit there and copy and paste.

478
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,440
You know, they read someone else's article, if it's from a associated press, then it's brand

479
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,360
that is good. It's true. It's real news. Let's copy paste. There are plenty of people who benefit

480
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:13,000
from sensationalism about minor events at nuclear plants. Unistar nuclear has filed the first

481
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
application for a license to construct a nuclear power plant in the United States in 30 years.

482
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:26,040
Coward Cliffs Maryland, the proposed site, is about 40 miles from my house and 50 miles from Washington.

483
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,400
I am thrilled at the prospects of cleaner air in the local area. Adam's atomic engine projects

484
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,520
are progressing nicely, but it's not yet time for any damned announcements. Take care. No problem.

485
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,960
Here, if you miss a charger too, it is hard to keep up anyway. No pills at all. Life is too much

486
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:48,840
fun without them. Man, are you kidding me? You've had so many red pills. You're pooping red.

487
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,240
Atomic Rod, cutting through the crap about atomic and energy. I'm still interested, man.

488
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:02,040
You know, I still haven't read a really convincing story telling me otherwise. Now that I know

489
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,640
that atomic waste isn't like some goo that seeps into the earth, but it's basically like a hard

490
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,240
rock. Could you build houses out of atomic waste? Could we do that? Could you make like sender blocks out

491
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,040
of that stuff? How radioactive is it? Can we put a coating over it so that it's safe?

492
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,040
Ah, these are just the questions I have when I wake up early in the morning.

493
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:29,080
Let me see. You know, another red pill blue pill thing. This is, I'm not quite sure how long

494
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,120
this will run. I just want to play a little bit. This is from Michelle from whispered pearls.

495
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,000
You'll see in the artwork for today's show. She's one of the bitches of pod show. A nice little

496
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,080
little artwork. She zipped over to me. And she used to work at playboy magazine. And although I'm

497
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,480
sure you know, it's, well, actually, I'm not sure, you know, if you listen to Michelle, she's

498
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,240
going to tell you how few people really understand how much work is done to the pictures that appear

499
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,200
in playboy, which is not the only publication that knows how to use Photoshop.

500
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:08,280
You know, the thing that I know and I've worked in media my whole life in various forms, but

501
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:17,720
the thing that I know is that it isn't always, you know, big lies, like that,

502
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:25,160
antileboots thing with the queen. But it's just as often, little lies, little things here and there

503
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,240
cutting something a certain way, editing something a certain way, air brushing something a certain

504
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:40,520
way to make something look good. And there are, I think, are two main culprits here. One is

505
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:50,760
expediency and one is perfectionism. I think the cult of perfectionism is going to kill us if we

506
00:30:50,840 --> 00:31:00,280
don't turn it around. And I think people know that I used to work at playboy and I've seen

507
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:10,040
both of these things rampant there and everyone, of course, actually, I thought everyone knew this,

508
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:16,360
but I used to go to conferences and talk to people and the women were just shocked to find out

509
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:24,600
that the playmates are airbrushed massively. This is so hard to believe. Do women actually

510
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,040
look at these women in playboy magazine and think that they're born that way, that they are naturally

511
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:38,920
that shape, that that sheen and that sexy? They thought that, you know, women come out of the box

512
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:46,120
perfect like this and I was like, how many women do you know? Do you know any that actually look

513
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:52,040
like that? No, they don't look like that. Trust me, they have blemishes, they have tattoos,

514
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:57,800
they have wrinkles, they have hairs and weird places, they have all kinds of things just like

515
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:07,720
everybody else. They're not these, you know, airbrushed specimens of perfection that you see in this magazine,

516
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:15,000
they're not. And every magazine does that to a greater or lesser degree. I mean, the most

517
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,920
egregious ones are magazines like red book that put, you know, a celebrity's face on a totally

518
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:26,920
different body, you know? I mean, that's just just because you can, doesn't mean you should.

519
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,160
But here comes the reason, one of the reasons I'm bringing this up is because

520
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:41,400
I'm in recovery and it is really important to me to be honest. And I remember when I first got

521
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:51,960
sober talking to people in various industries, whether it's media or advertising or sports or

522
00:32:52,840 --> 00:33:01,080
stockbrokers, just, you know, the spectrum of jobs talking to people and, you know,

523
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:08,200
the way that we operate in recovery is 100% honesty, 100% of the time. But

524
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:17,960
most of the time, people get tripped up in their jobs and they say, well, okay, I can be honest

525
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:24,040
with my family and my friends, but I can't be honest on my job because that's not how it works.

526
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:32,920
And, you know, if I'm helping to lead a revolution in podcasting, that is one of the things

527
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:40,600
that I would like to change or help to change. Michelle, you are helping so much. You have no idea.

528
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,160
For you to tell these stories and I think she's going to talk about the letters to the editor next.

529
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:51,240
I could listen to Michelle for hours. I'm sorry. It's just, I love, I, I somehow really get into

530
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,320
the sound of a voice. It's a pretty big, as Adam, so eloquently stated, it's a pretty big animal

531
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:07,800
to try and change to get, you know, TV, radio, film, you name it, newspapers, magazines, whatever,

532
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:15,160
to change their tactics and actually tell the truth. Exactly. Go around it. Forget about it.

533
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:22,600
It's a really big, big thing that Adam is putting on the table here. And I hope, you know what?

534
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:31,960
I'm 30 more seconds. Everybody, every podcast or everybody who's hearing this takes up this

535
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:40,200
cause because here's the thing. It's not okay to lie. It's not okay if you're in the media.

536
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,520
It's not okay if you're a politician. It's not okay if you're a friend talking one to one.

537
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,920
Lying is not okay. So let's look at the world with a new world view.

538
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:03,800
You got to listen to it. Michelle Bell's Hollywood actually is the name of this particular show.

539
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:11,080
And this is episode number 18. So, you know, and that's I think what people when they first

540
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,640
listen to something that's created independently, which is as open and honest because we really

541
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,480
have no need to not be open and honest. It takes people a second or two to get used to it.

542
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,640
And they say, wait a minute, this is kind of refreshing. You know, this is, hey, it's kind of like

543
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,760
it's got all the warts and all the bumps and everything all over it. And it's, wow, you know,

544
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,800
there's like a human being on the other end of the microphone or the other the other end of the camera.

545
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:43,960
It really does work. So yes, expose the lies. So people understand what mainstream has been

546
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,440
doing for years and how it works. Nothing wrong with it. By the way, I think you can do a lot for

547
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,040
enemy looks. It comes or lies. They're acted. Nothing wrong with stuff being acted. But don't

548
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:59,640
try and pawn it off as the truth. And really, the most important message is just go around it,

549
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,800
go around everything. We have everything in place. We just need to build up more audience.

550
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,560
Same thing goes to, you know, goes for what we started talking about the show about the

551
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:15,400
Podsake Music Network. Hi, Adam Nick here. I just had a quick thought regarding the Podsake

552
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:22,120
Music Network. I got a podcast. The Nick Menel Show at Nick Reynolds.com. And I was

553
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,440
trolling through the Podsake Music Network to find some tunes to put on my latest show. And I

554
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:32,600
came across Sydney and Mobile Disco. And I thought fantastic. One of my favorite acts at the moment.

555
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,560
And then on the Podsake Music Network, I can't believe it. So I downloaded the tracks that put

556
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,840
up there, which especially was their entire album, their latest album. And I played some tracks on

557
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,960
my show. And I still can't quite believe it that I'm playing such a sort of hit contemporary

558
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,920
acts. And their tracks are available to me on the PNN, which is fantastic. But it's not dedicated

559
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,520
to me. And it may be slightly paranoid. What's the stock? And I'm scooping this person,

560
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:05,080
ripping a CD of any artist, and uploading them to the PNN, and pretending to be that artist.

561
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,720
And, unfortunately, giving permission for those tracks to be downloaded and played.

562
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,760
And I'm not an artist, so I've never tried to upload any music. I'm not sure of the hoops

563
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,080
you have to jump through. But it was just a thought, maybe a paranoid one, but just a thought.

564
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,240
All right. Thanks, Adam. And then it'll plug from my show. The Nick Metal Show,

565
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,560
Nick Reynolds.com, every Thursday, saying the best independent music on the internet.

566
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,640
Okay, mate, cheers. All right. All right, Nick. Thank you. Well, you know what? I checked it out for you.

567
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,840
Simeon Mobile Disco, indeed, is on the Podsake Music Network. And their tracks were uploaded by their

568
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:42,440
label. Their label is the Wichita label. Now, we have two people working full time on the Podsake Music

569
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,600
Network. Again, we make no money with it, but it's really great for getting content out there.

570
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:52,280
And it's just changing the media industry, if you will, which is a big part of the mission here.

571
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,440
I think it's only happened once that someone uploaded, I can, I can't remember who it was,

572
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,080
but in two and a half years, only one time did someone upload something illegally that wasn't

573
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,120
that didn't have the rights to. And, you know, essentially, that's the culture that we set up.

574
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,320
The culture was, look, this is not for ripping off the John Stuart Show and making programming out of it.

575
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,720
This is for independent producers. That's what Pods Show.com is about. That's what the Podsake Music Network

576
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,120
is about. And it works. And it turns out that, guess what? People aren't really thieves.

577
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,760
You know, there aren't tons of people signing up to rip the stuff off. Because, yeah, I mean,

578
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,760
you don't even have to have a show, I guess. And you could register and you could download

579
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,720
your hards content, but guess what? People aren't thieves. They care about the artist. People

580
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,600
want to promote the artist because they like the music. You know, it's like the, it's like the early

581
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:48,520
coffee houses of the, of the 60s. It's haspory eight all over again. Eight, eight, eight haspory.

582
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,520
I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. But I do have,

583
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,280
Simeon Mobile disco for you, since it's on the PNN anyway.

584
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:52,520
You know, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's

585
00:39:52,520 --> 00:40:22,520
like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, you're like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like this, it's like, it's like, it's really, completely, it's like, Yeah, it's like, it's like, it's, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it, it, it, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like,

586
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,520
It's a big

587
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
It's a big

588
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,520
It's a big

589
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,520
It's a big

590
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,520
It's a big

591
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,520
It's a big

592
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,520
You don't need no imitation

593
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
It's a big

594
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,520
Because this is my creation

595
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,520
It's a big

596
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
It's a big

597
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
It's a big

598
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
It's a big

599
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:34,520
It's a big

600
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,520
This is big

601
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,520
It's a big

602
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,520
It's a big

603
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,520
It's a big

604
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:48,680
I know you know

605
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,800
Now, see, here's a track of like Sid Bernstein to evaluate because it's not entirely my music,

606
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:00,360
but anyone who joins the Pod State Music Network is a friend of mine.

607
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,320
Sid me in Mobile Disco. It's the beat. You can find out the Pod State Music Network music.

608
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,120
Got Pod Show.com, a link to that, of course, in the show notes at DailySourceCode.com.

609
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,080
Big day tomorrow and it's in London. Hopefully, I'll be able to

610
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,720
seek out a show before I leave. If not, it'll be Thursday. DailySourceCode.com,

611
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,080
Adam at PodShow.com, have a great day talking tomorrow.

612
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,920
Another Pod Show podcast. Stick it in your ear.
