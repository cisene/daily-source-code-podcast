00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Make a statement with Sony stereo ear buds, sleek metal housings that reduce vibration

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:15,000
delivering killer sound from a tiny package, by yours at Sony.com-slashheadphones, Sony ear buds

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,000
were styled meat sound.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There are Charlie, 6, 9, 3.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't take the smell, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise.

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise.

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,120
the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the noise, I can't take the E. I have to help while

12
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:55,120
But keep the like a dango, it's a don't rip, it's seen the loss, because let's sit down at the beach, so watch it on the reef, so she can tell us stories to the girl back home

13
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:09,120
So, push me, cause I'm close to the edge, I'm tired, not too tired, it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head

14
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:39,120
And it's too much panic in this town, I'm going in deeper and deeper, I know it's my head, I know it's too much panic in this town, it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head, I know it's my head,

16
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,720
Who's too much panic in this town?

17
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,320
I'm going on deeper and I'm alive

18
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,520
I'm going on deeper and I'm alive

19
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,720
Who's too much panic in this town?

20
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm going on deeper and I'm alive

21
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,520
I'm going on deeper and I'm alive

22
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
Who's too much panic in this town?

23
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,920
Don't push me

24
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Calls, I'm close to the end

25
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,320
I'm trying to miss

26
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,120
Oh, I'm trying

27
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
Oh, I love the light

28
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,120
A little bit of French mash in the middle of the week

29
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
DJ Moore did a deep message

30
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,120
On the Daily Source Code episode number 693

31
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,120
Hey everybody, how you doing coming to you from the Curry condo

32
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,120
In Northern California, it is the Daily Source Code

33
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,120
Just as I started kicking things off there

34
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
I see Google notebook froze

35
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
That's interesting, so I have to get to that later on

36
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Sorry about yesterday

37
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,120
A full intention to do a show for you

38
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,120
But you know how it goes in these long days

39
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Actually, what happened was went out to dinner

40
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Came back at 830

41
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Wasn't bed at 9 o'clock because I knew I had to get up at 630

42
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,120
That is even if I could get through the night

43
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Because these days, six hours, six and a half hours

44
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,120
That's it, I'm wide awake

45
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,120
I was asleep at 915, 930, slept until 630

46
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
It was fantastic, I've had such a great day

47
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Really a lot of energy, man

48
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
It's nice, nice, nice, nice

49
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
And I prepared a pretty good show for you

50
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
Lots of good feedback

51
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,120
And in fact, doing a lot of stuff with music

52
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
In the past couple of days

53
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
And I can't wait until Fubar Friday

54
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
It's going to be awesome

55
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
I got a lot of songs that I got to share with you guys

56
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,120
All of course, part of the soundtrack to our lives

57
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,120
And well, it's been, was it two times in San

58
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
Fran in the past four weeks, more or less

59
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Ranger Craig, still checking in from the rock

60
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Let me know how things are going here

61
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
So all of them, how you doing?

62
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
It's Ranger Craig from the rock

63
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
So here I am driving home from out the trans

64
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
After a hard day, work out on the rock

65
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
And I see your twitter that you're sitting near the first

66
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
So what the hell are the first

67
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
F-P-R-F?

68
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
I think the sample system for 20 years

69
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
I don't know what the first is

70
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Well, let me tell you, this was

71
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Today we were in, we were called

72
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
The G-S-N conference room

73
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
A G-S-D, I'm sorry

74
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
To get shit done conference room

75
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
And the lights were all dim

76
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Then with a bunch of geeks and we're all looking

77
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Big monitors and like 8 million MacBook Pro's on the

78
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
On the long conference table

79
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
And Chris McIntyre

80
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
You know podcast Ali Dude, the Firf

81
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Come on man, he's the Firf

82
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Everyone knows the Firf

83
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
He's a big Twitter hound

84
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
At least I think he is

85
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,120
And now that I have the Mac

86
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
Hooked up eye chats so that it receives

87
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Twitters

88
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
It's kind of interesting, you know?

89
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
I'm following along with

90
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Lots of interesting little tidbits throughout the day

91
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
It's kind of like a

92
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
I don't know, it's kind of like

93
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
The nerd version of breaking news, you know

94
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
There's lots of dumb stuff on there

95
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
But it's kind of cool because you know

96
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,120
I can follow who I want to follow

97
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
And so I follow the Firf, you know, because he's always

98
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Send in a little updates

99
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
Excuse me

100
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
So

101
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
What was I going to say?

102
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Right, so this was kind of a mind-fuck

103
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
In a way because now I'm sitting right next

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
I'm like, you know what?

105
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm going to Twitter and I'm going to say I'm sitting next to him

106
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
And see if he's online, which he wasn't by the way

107
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Because he didn't respond

108
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
But then to come back to the condo

109
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
And Ranger Craig to have you say that you saw that

110
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
That's that's trippy

111
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,120
That's like a really interesting connection

112
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
So I tweeted hoping that I'd find

113
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Chris Mac

114
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
You saw it, you called in the voicemail

115
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
I'm playing it back on the show

116
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Maybe Chris Macintire will twitter me back

117
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
To complete the circle

118
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
I tried to send you a twitter back

119
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Don't know if you'll see it or not

120
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
Finding out what the Firf is

121
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
If I knew what it was, I'd come and join you and sit too

122
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
So, well Adam, take care

123
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,120
You know I'm here in San Francisco

124
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
You never ever need anything

125
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Come out and visit us on the rock

126
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Or else just give us a call

127
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
I don't know if it looks here for a long or longer

128
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Then I have greetings

129
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Adios from the rock

130
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,120
Nice

131
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Right on some social things to do

132
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Interesting, that sounded kind of intriguing

133
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Ranger Craig

134
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
What does that mean?

135
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
I think I do have a hot date later this week though

136
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
Having dinner with a Natalie Delcante

137
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
I didn't get to do it last time I was here

138
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
So, I have dinner that is

139
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
Kind of sad news in the

140
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
In the world of rock and roll, Kevin Dubrow

141
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Lead singer of quiet riot

142
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
Past away in his home

143
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
At his home in Vegas

144
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,120
And I've met Kevin, of course I've met a lot of the

145
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
A lot of the dudes from quiet riot

146
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
You know that I'm a long time acquaintances

147
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
With Rudy Sarzo

148
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Who played bass for a while in the band

149
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
And

150
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Actually, I wanted to see

151
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Madpod, you know, crazy as JD

152
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Madpod has a

153
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Kevin Dubrow quiet riot interview

154
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
At Madpod.com

155
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
I'll put a link in the show notes so you can go

156
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Check that out

157
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
I don't see with any other news

158
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
I'll just check and see the article here

159
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Hold on

160
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
How old was he 52 years old?

161
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Discovered Sunday afternoon

162
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
God, that sucks

163
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
That's weird man

164
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
That's just weird

165
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,120
So many people passing away

166
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Then, of course, he definitely enriched

167
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
The soundtrack to my life

168
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
He was one of the original glam dudes

169
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
So he will be missed for sure

170
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Not just by musical lovers

171
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
I'm sure his family is well

172
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
So my thoughts are with him

173
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
So more, you know, more like really weird stuff

174
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
I was in the same get shit

175
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Done conference room

176
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
What I sent this twitter as a test

177
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
And, you know, I have a sling box

178
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
And I haven't been able to get the sling box

179
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
The sling player to work with the

180
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
Well, I had but not on the Mac

181
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Wasn't able to get it to work

182
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
With the one that we have hooked up

183
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
To a Tvo at the office here

184
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
So I wanted to just do a quick configuration

185
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
And I was able to

186
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
You know, basically get it to play

187
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
And, you know, I was checking out

188
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Geek Brief and stuff like that

189
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
And then this message comes in today

190
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
Hey Adam Curry, this is Julia from New York

191
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Calling you

192
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
I just wanted to let you know

193
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,120
I've been checking out the

194
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
You know, the pot show shows

195
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
They're actually on the Tvo cast

196
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
And I came back to myself

197
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
What's going on with some beef TV

198
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,120
And I noticed that the date was October or something

199
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,120
So I went online to see what episode you were up to

200
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,120
And you're actually up to 60 something

201
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,120
But the last episode that I downloaded on the Tvo cast

202
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
Is 237

203
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
So there must be some kind of

204
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,120
Fiendish you going on with between you and Tvo

205
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,120
Anyway, I hope you get that fixed up

206
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
And fuck you, I'm Curry

207
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Oh, dude, thank you so much

208
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
That's so kind of you

209
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Yeah, I saw a much more recent episode

210
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
So in this of course, it's a pod catcher

211
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Essentially, right?

212
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,120
It's downloading this stuff onto your Tvo's hard drive

213
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
And it should be sitting there waiting for you

214
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
So for some reason there was a disconnect

215
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Then maybe you missed an episode

216
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
I'm really not sure how the

217
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
How the Tvo cast works exactly

218
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
But I will say it's pretty cool

219
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
You know, I told you we have this like

220
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Special pod show Tvo cast

221
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
The leader that we've created

222
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
And then we have the rating

223
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
You know, it's for what ages

224
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
It's appropriate and it's cool

225
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
It's a really, really high quality

226
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,120
Even though it's looking through the slink player

227
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
It was nice to see

228
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
So you know what?

229
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
I'll find out a little bit more

230
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Actually, I think Brian, no one and PW

231
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,120
They're responsible for a big part of the chain

232
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Because it does include transcoding

233
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
And all kinds of stuff that has to happen

234
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,120
To make this television quality for the Tvo folks

235
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,120
I'll ask them if they know exactly how it works

236
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
If you can sometimes miss episodes or what happens

237
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
And we'll find out

238
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Let me see

239
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
I got so much to do today

240
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,120
Oh yeah, this is, this is important

241
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
So I've completely missed this one

242
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,120
The hard rock hotel, the hard rock

243
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Is opening up a hotel in San Diego

244
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Which I've been to San Diego

245
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
A couple times for some conferences

246
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
I didn't mind seeing a conference

247
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Telled at the hard rock in San Diego

248
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
I'll tell you that

249
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Brian knew it's going to be

250
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Let me see what they got

251
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
This is obviously an advertisement

252
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
But there's something cool if you've got a band

253
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Or if you know someone who's got a band

254
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
Because they're doing a special promotion

255
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
With audiostreet.net

256
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
And

257
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Essentially

258
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
If they're going to do a battle of the bands

259
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
And if your band wins

260
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
I'll check this out

261
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
You'll be at the grand opening

262
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
Of the campaign

263
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
Black Eyed Peas

264
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
Opening up for you

265
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Grand opening of the hotel

266
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Let me see if there's a date on this

267
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
No

268
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
But it's pretty cool

269
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
You get on the bill with Black Eyed Peas

270
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
You'll perform at the brand new hard rock in San Diego

271
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Which I haven't seen a picture yet

272
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
And I'll see if I can find a picture

273
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
And I'll also post a link

274
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,120
So that if you're in a band and you want to participate in this battle of the bands you can do so

275
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
There

276
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,120
Not didn't hurt too much, now did it

277
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Hey Adam, it's Rafael over in 10 years on a

278
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
I remember a few episodes back

279
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
He were talking about

280
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
You know, the next, you know, unscripted reality show

281
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Whatever

282
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Would be like a

283
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
A choir or a drum line can show

284
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Well, I was watching

285
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Heroes and Journeyman today on NBC

286
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
And well, in the old, I see a commercial for

287
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
I can't remember exactly what it's called

288
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
But it's a choir show

289
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I think it starts right December 13

290
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
There's some like that, but yeah, called it man

291
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Yep, right later

292
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Yeah, I'm telling you, you should take your choir to

293
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
That battle of the bands at the hard rock in San Diego

294
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
Or of course

295
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
These guys might participate

296
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
I don't know if they're still around

297
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Some say I sound like the lead singer of this band

298
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
When I sing

299
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Which, of course, means it sounds like he's in marble pain

300
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
We'll play

301
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,120
We'll play

302
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120

We'll play

We'll play

312
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
We'll play

313
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
We'll play

314
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,120
We'll play

We'll play

319
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
We'll play

320
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
We'll play

321
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,120
We'll play

322
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
We'll play

323
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
We'll play

We'll play

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

326
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:53,120
baby with your clothes, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:14,440
Get out.

329
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

330
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:57,080
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah,

331
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,080
yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, god or bra.

332
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:05,900
Now guys today, this, first match are...

333
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,600
podshow.com slash music link in the show notes, of course, a data source code.com.

334
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,000
You know, something else we were talking about at the office over the past couple of days was

335
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,200
this news about the iPhone. I've heard a lot of people talking about it and I've seen some blog posts

336
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,840
that the iPhone and the UK, a lot of the new owners are experiencing signal problems,

337
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:42,200
literally not able to pick up the, what is it, O2, the O2 signal in certain, and well, apparently,

338
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,200
and lots of spots. I've seen just hundreds and hundreds of postings and, you know, some folks are

339
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,840
saying that if they actually plug it into the dock, then it does work better, which I got to tell you,

340
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,200
this is coming back to me now, because of course, I had a US iPhone and I'll tell you, there's

341
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,160
no difference between the two because the US iPhone, that of course, I took over and I used the

342
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,640
the jailbreak to put in my existing AT&T SIM card, so I could use it over there with my existing

343
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,960
account. I two noticed that there were a couple of spots in the house where I would get

344
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:23,240
fine reception with the Nokia with the E61I, but I would not get any signal at all with the iPhone.

345
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,520
In particular, you'll just be honest about it in the crapper. I've got my own private

346
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,120
throne where I do my business. It's also where I drop the iPhone into the toilet.

347
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,640
You know, it's tricked out, right? It's got everything, including good Wi-Fi connection and

348
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,200
astraise. You know what I'm talking about? I'm a guy. I like to take my time.

349
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,080
And that's my meditation time. And I've had the iPhone in there when just unable to get a signal

350
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,280
unable to to send text messages, you know, that's actually how I noticed it, because I wasn't

351
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,960
getting any calls. And I was usually just using the Wi-Fi, but with the E61I, not not a

352
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,200
problem. And I too noticed that if I plugged it into the dock upstairs in the attic,

353
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,160
I would get more bars. I get full five bars. And you know, I understand that's RF, you know,

354
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:18,840
you basically expand the ground plane of your antenna. So I just like to say that I think the

355
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,080
iPhone just has inferior antenna technology built in. Talk about it with John C. DeVore Act today.

356
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,920
We'll probably bring it up on Noah Jenda. He said, well, yeah, it's all made of metal.

357
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:36,520
I like, yeah, maybe that could be part of it. But also think about all the people who got an iPhone and

358
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:42,040
had to switch to the new AT&T. And I've had singular and AT&T for a couple of years now. I really

359
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,080
don't have any problems with reception. I just really don't. I think I've said it on the show before.

360
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,480
But you know, those people that were complaining how AT&T sucks so bad, maybe a part of it was

361
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,240
because the iPhone just has inferior antenna technology.

362
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,080
Now, hopefully someone will pick this news up and go investigate it. I know that there's people out there

363
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:08,120
who understand how to measure antenna effectiveness and the radius. And I mean, you know, there's a lot of

364
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,800
people who understand that shit. It's really, when it comes to RF radio frequencies, it's a lot of

365
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,320
advanced mumbo jumbo science as far as I'm concerned. But there are guys who know how to, and

366
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,600
gals who know how to figure this out. And they should do that. Just you see what the, what the deal is.

367
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,400
I just think it's a design flaw. And I'll bet you that Apple knows about it, too.

368
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,160
I'll bet you they do. And you know, there was something about cramming it all into the nice little

369
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:42,120
flash, little box that made it all go wrong. Anyway, I'm a couple of other phone questions.

370
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,400
Actually, uh, one about the E61 and the Nokia 810, the internet tablet. I'm loving so much.

371
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,280
How do they sound good? I don't know. Thanks very much. You'll thoughtful response to my question

372
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,720
about the five way navigators on the 810. All right. That's what I talked about on Monday.

373
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,480
He had a question. If since it's now in a different place from the N800,

374
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:08,040
if it was awkward using it. And, you know, I think honestly, not really, it is different.

375
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,240
It does make a difference. But I'm, you know, I'm using it more with the keyboard open than

376
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,280
using the touch screen. So yeah, there is a difference. Yeah, I think you've, you know,

377
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,920
I take it on the head and it's silly. I'll need to go to Nokia's design skills in deciding

378
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,360
where to put the thing in the first place. It's funny after nearly 10 years of using touch

379
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,880
screens on palms. I've been touch screen free since May with the E61 and it's kind of forgotten

380
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,280
touch screen was even there. Yeah, I got to tell you, you know, you do get used to it. It's,

381
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,280
yeah, you can get used to touch screen, but it's not the end all to be all. You know, I'm,

382
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,560
I'm into the, what you call it, the five way button. It works for me too. I agree that E61,

383
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:54,360
I don't miss the touch screen at all. Talking of E61, I, which I know you love. Last week

384
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,000
a firmware upgrade came out for the version 1.1 something to the two points. Oh, I got to get

385
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,800
that one. I did mine, eventually, and to change the product code because the Nokia software

386
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:11,960
update, it kept telling me the update wasn't available, but I used a program called Nemesis. Nemesis

387
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:18,040
services or NSS to old to the product code to when I found on the internet. That sounds really

388
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:25,320
user friendly. I've read it successfully. Oh, good. The only thing that isn't so smooth and seamless

389
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,600
is the backup restore because it's got a few badly behaved programs. Yeah, I've noticed that that

390
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:37,800
backup restore just in general, it doesn't really work. You know, I think that the platform just

391
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,800
doesn't feel that mature, you know, I'm always missing settings and there's all kinds of stuff.

392
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,600
And it's on the E61 eye as well as on the N8010. That's just not completely great yet.

393
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,400
There, uh, disappeared completely despite being backed up and then restored,

394
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,440
allegedly restored, and some that come as corrupted stubs, we then have to be reinstalled.

395
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,720
Yeah. And so much say they're there, but they're not. They're going to ask the open. Yeah.

396
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,040
But by and large, once you get them all back in, the sounds working the way it was with the

397
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,120
new firmware. Yeah. And then you kind of shake it or it was shaking around and then, you know,

398
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,720
bounce it once or twice on the bed and then it works. I know that's my experience as well.

399
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,560
Can't wait to do it again. Can't wait to upgrade the firmware. And it is better in some respects.

400
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,160
So, though, knock it up, publish it, change bugs. They're all falling down in the dark.

401
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Time to work out what exactly has changed. It's not so easy to explain why it's better.

402
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,360
It just hits you so we've got to have it. Anyway. Yeah. Bye, right now. And of course.

403
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:39,720
Yes. Fuck you. Adam Curry. Thank you. I love it so much when you guys do that.

404
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,320
Dean Regal says Adam, a long time listener of the show. I've come to appreciate your comments and

405
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,160
products that you use. I was wondering if you could tell me how browsing the internet on the

406
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,680
Nokia N95 compares to the iPhone. I want to get one of these two products but can't decide.

407
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,000
I've seen the iPhone and the way you surf the net, but have not seen the Nokia in action.

408
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,720
Thanks. And fuck you, Adam Curry. Am I going to get rid of this? Well, I've

409
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,720
ever lived that one down. Okay. I'll get an N95. I'll let you know. I have looked at it. I've

410
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:16,040
had it in my hands several times. And Natalie Del Conti was using one today. And Chris Jacob,

411
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,720
Headmaster Sales, Weasel Extraordinary, uses, I think he uses that the most. He has like 18

412
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,920
phones with them all the time. But of course, you know, six Weasel. So I'll find out. I have to say that

413
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:36,040
you know, I'll stick by it. The whole zooming that pinching thing that that you do with the iPhone.

414
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,560
That's awesome. That is just awesome. It's just a great way to zoom in and just, you know, you can do it.

415
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,920
We want you can be doing everything with one hand. It's cool without a doubt. But it doesn't make

416
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,520
every other device useless. And, you know, my biggest problem is just it's really the battery life.

417
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,840
That's started. It's just the basics of that. You know, my day is just longer than seven hours.

418
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,040
Sorry, Cooper, do you know, can help you? Hey, I have a video from the Daddycast. Just wanted to pass along

419
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,480
that the Sony headphones that you're promoting. I hop on line last night to take a look at them.

420
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,880
And I've got to thank you because now I've got something on my Christmas list that my left

421
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,560
can get. I mean, it's really cool. If I use my, you know, I found you're listening to the iPod,

422
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,120
you're working out, or you're working out in the yard. And the cord always gets in the way.

423
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,880
So I've been looking for the past couple years for something that wasn't totally expensive,

424
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,040
but would still get the job done. And these look to be perfect. They've got different headphones,

425
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,960
styles that are Bluetooth, and in a little iPod, Bluetooth plug-in. So it would be perfect.

426
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,800
And just wanted to say thanks. And it's a great product. If you haven't seen it yet,

427
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,560
they should check it out. I may not talk to you soon. Have fun out on the same frame.

428
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,880
Yo, yo, I'm back. Yo, I'm PD Love. Thanks, man. Appreciate that report.

429
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,440
Yeah, I'm on an Amazon trip these days. I'm posting links to stuff on Amazon so you can go buy it.

430
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,880
And it works. It really does. I'm liking it. So it doesn't even matter if if the product is

431
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,120
from an advertiser or not. I'm just putting links in because, you know, I really just want to see

432
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:12,680
people going buy stuff. And you do. It's not like I make a ton of money. Because what's funny

433
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,080
with Amazon is, and you put those links in, and then, you know, people may go in because they click on

434
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,320
the N-800-10 link, which, of course, will change. We're getting pretty close to getting all of our

435
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,160
codes and everything sorted out. So we can give you guys a real discount. But already, people are

436
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,160
buying it through that link through Amazon. I know you can't wait. And you're probably going to

437
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:37,560
wind up paying 50 bucks more at least if, you know, at least 50 bucks more than, uh, than a pod show

438
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,760
will be over to offer it to you for. But yeah, you can't wait. Go ahead. But then you people click

439
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,200
around. They buy other stuff. And they buy books and they buy music. And, and it's fun to watch,

440
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,480
you know, to see what people have bought after just, I guess, going in and getting lost and

441
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,240
surfing around. And I get a hit for that. You know, I get some kind of credit. So it's cool.

442
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,800
Now, let me see two more phone calls. So we do that. Let me just remind everyone of, uh, of the

443
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,880
number you can call if you want to participate in the show.

444
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,200
6, 3, 5, 7.

445
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:33,960
Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip.

446
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,400
And here is our EU correspondent greetings that I'm carry. Here is CSB with another update

447
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:46,840
about EU. Good. So, allegedly, the reason why work were the second started was because

448
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:55,160
Poland, the nice Germany and extraterritorial highway between the main territory of Germany

449
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:02,520
and the detached eastern part of Germany, called East Prussia. Interesting. I didn't know that that was

450
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,880
the actual moment that World War II started. I know that it started with Poland, in Poland,

451
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,480
involving Poland. I didn't know that part. Thank you. German, it's Os Poison.

452
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:20,680
Of Poison, yeah. Well, starting December 21st, so very soon, with December 21st, 2007,

453
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,120
there will be no longer any border or passport controls between German and Poland and

454
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:34,440
such situation as it was during the, what were the second would never be possible now.

455
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:42,600
You've got it, sir. It was for, for, for. Because that situation would be moved now, such issue.

456
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:51,560
So, why it is because from the 21st, December 2007, the so-called Schengen Zone,

457
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:57,000
Schengen is a small village in Luxembourg. Schengen Zone will be extended and will cover now also

458
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:05,400
Eastern European members of EU. So now it will be possible to go from Finland through Estonia,

459
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:12,200
Latvia, Itoeania, Poland, Germany, France, to Spain, by car, without any passport or border controls.

460
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,640
So, no, is that good? That's the good news, I think, and the peace in Europe is spreading.

461
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:26,280
So, thank you and cheers. Thank you very much, CSB. That's cool, man. Of course, it's more important

462
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,240
to go from Spain of North, because Spain has all the good, you know what I'm saying?

463
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:52,200
Hey Adam, we're coming from the hamster. I'm a run-pull meet-up group organizer and I'm a coacher

464
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,840
for the C. Coast Area for his campaign. I love your support of him. I'm so appreciative.

465
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:06,840
I know it's helped out a lot, but man, I'm stressed. Come on, man. We need you here. Would you be

466
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,120
possibly willing to come to New Hampshire? We need to win New Hampshire? Okay, hold on a second, this is

467
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:19,560
interesting. You know, I endorse Ron Paul, would love to see him become president of the United

468
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,680
States. I think he's got a great agenda. His agenda is a very small booklet. You can just google it.

469
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:31,080
It's called the Constitution. Google Ron Paul, if you want to know more, and I'd love to help out.

470
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:37,080
I'm not quite sure what I can do, and I'd have to work out the timing, because I guess it's coming

471
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:43,080
up soon, the New Hampshire primary. So, give me some details. Give me some info. When do I have to be there?

472
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,520
What do I got to do? Do I have to bring the Posse? We need to win Iowa. If you have Iowa,

473
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,560
opportunity at all. To go to Iowa? I know you're far away, man, but it's okay.

474
00:31:53,560 --> 00:32:00,120
Team here and did like a college speaking tour. I got to come up with something else.

475
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,960
This college speaking tour, I don't think is going to work. Let's think of something I can do.

476
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,960
Or we could do, maybe. Should I go meet a whole bunch of people in New Hampshire and Iowa?

477
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,920
If I could make it work in the schedule, I'd try, I'd move stuff around. That could be fun.

478
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,280
The date, I know, but we could whip it together for you. We're amazing here in New Hampshire,

479
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,640
the grassroots. I mean, we could just whip it together, and I'm sure a college tour. I'm sure

480
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:33,800
all the college students know who you are. Is it possible at all? This is life or death, man.

481
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,840
We've got to have Ron Paul Wynn, and we still have a huge uphill battle here in New Hampshire.

482
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,880
Even though things are going pretty well, we have these evil people.

483
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,040
Julianne and Romney who are just dominating, and I just saw some poll numbers and they actually don't

484
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,360
look that great. What do you mean by that?

485
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,120
1% of people say they would never vote for Ron Paul. Really?

486
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,840
Don't spread that number around, but that's what. A little late for that.

487
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,280
Polls, I don't believe in polls. What companies are doing the polls? How are they polling?

488
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:18,120
It's it. Please. What I'm really curious about is, do we really have a vast army on the

489
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,080
interwebs who are going to go out and vote for this guy or not? That's what I need to find out.

490
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,160
One thing's for sure. If it's not this time around, it will be there will be another time around.

491
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:36,920
But this God wouldn't be nice. When we accelerate so much, wouldn't so many great things happen

492
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,160
if we got even just getting Ron Paul through the primaries.

493
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:49,160
Getting on the Republican ticket. Can you just imagine what that would mean for the power that we

494
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:59,320
ourselves harness amongst this vast network? We're millions of people who flame and talk and yell

495
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:06,200
and shout and reach out and are helpful and there's humanity and love and all emotions.

496
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,360
Black and white, all the time running through these wires, these series of tubes.

497
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,280
Now we finally have a chance to go and do something. All it will take is a lot more of what we're

498
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:28,280
doing already, renting and raving, posting and motivating, being opinionated. And then just on one

499
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,520
day, you got to get your ass out of the house and go take a box. It's really not that hard.

500
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:44,280
You really don't have to do that much. I know a lot of you are undeclared. You can really make a

501
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,480
difference here. You can really really make a difference. Fuck the polls. That's what the poll

502
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:57,240
numbers in the hamster look like and so we need and those are just for people being pulled. So

503
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:03,560
there's a lot of people not being pulled. College students that never voted, they're not being

504
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,480
pulled. So we have an opportunity here to reach some people who were never of age to vote before.

505
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,880
And the college students are going to be one of our biggest supporters. Yeah, that's a good point.

506
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:23,000
That really is a good point. And they're the ones that are online. So propagate my friends.

507
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,880
We can get through to them. They're really mixed up because they've been brainwashed, man.

508
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,320
They've really been brainwashed by the people who say that government has to be our

509
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:40,120
nanny. And government has to solve every global problem. And anyway, my name again is Wivkomo,

510
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:47,320
my number six. Yeah, I'm sorry. I really should have listened to that before. I didn't

511
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:53,640
listen to the whole thing. If there's any way you can help us. The center of the universe as far

512
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,320
as winning this election, we have to win the answer or come in second. Take it easy, man. And

513
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:09,240
oh, but fuck you. I fucking do it. I'll be out there. Let me give you some details. Okay, let's

514
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,480
get this going. What can we do? Can we do, uh, we get some potsafe artists? Uh, there's got to be

515
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,680
someone in New Hampshire, somewhere nearby. Can we just hang out? Can we just cause a ruckus?

516
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah. I'm, you know, I'm, you know, all the writing and all the talking. And now it's time for some action.

517
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,760
We got to go ahead and do something. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's the most important question

518
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:39,720
of the day. Hey. Adam, it's Kevin from Slechter, Noraks. Our line. It was your weekly stalking message. Yeah.

519
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,080
He calls me every single week with the same question. So I'm fine as well. Just to answer him.

520
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:50,080
It's again the one, no, whatever, Anthony Trinity.

521
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,080
Uh, that whole project has gone to shit.

522
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Big problems with insurance.

523
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Big problems with production insurance.

524
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Uh, sucks.

525
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,080
Uh, a black mark on my career.

526
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Uh, one or no, if you're still not smoking and how that's going for you.

527
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Uh,

528
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,080
No, I've fallen off that wagon.

529
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Relatively severely.

530
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,080
Uh, but there's always the new year.

531
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:28,080
Also, I want to know if you got the Hulu, uh, invite that I sent you and what you think of that.

532
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
Uh, yeah, I did.

533
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,080
And I talked about it on the show and I, uh, I think I thank you.

534
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
I appreciate it.

535
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,080
Um, and it's just, you know, it's all right.

536
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
It's, uh, it's okay.

537
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
It's, uh, it's their shows.

538
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,080
Uh, I'm not going to watch him because the writers aren't being paid for it.

539
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,080
So screw him.

540
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:49,080
You know, if, if they'll pay the writers for all those great shows that they're putting up online,

541
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,080
I'll go watch him.

542
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,080
I'll watch their advertising.

543
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Oh, by the products.

544
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
I know I will.

545
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
But out of principle, not screw him.

546
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,080
Not going to go back.

547
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
I don't care how good it is.

548
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,080
Fuck you, Adam Curry.

549
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
I have a good day.

550
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
All right, man.

551
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,080
Thank you.

552
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,080
I want to play one more from the soundtrack to my life for you as, uh,

553
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,080
we kind of, uh, slip over the hump of the week.

554
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:15,080
And move closer towards the last month of 2007.

555
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Hello.

556
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,080
How are you?

557
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,080
Have you been all right?

558
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Through all those lonely loneliness.

559
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,080
It's about saying.

560
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,080
I tell you everything.

561
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:41,080
You've become that deadly point.

562
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

563
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,080
Hey.

564
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,080
Are you feeling?

565
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Are you still the same?

566
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,080
Won't you realize the pain for deal with deal?

567
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Well, we've got a dream.

568
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,080
I just can't believe.

569
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:12,080
If I'll fade it out of you.

570
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,080
Yeah, yeah.

571
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:45,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

572
00:39:45,080 --> 00:40:15,080
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, I, oh, oh, no no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, girl, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I, oh, oh, oh, it, oh,more, going. the side again, come, come,

573
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,080
I love you

574
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,080
Okay, so no one's answering

575
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,080
Can't you just let it ring a little long along

576
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:50,080
I love you, I'll just stay with you

577
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,080
Who shadows on the night?

578
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Let it ring for never more

579
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Four days

580
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,080
Let it ring

581
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,080
Do it, do it, do it

582
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,080
Do it, do it, do it

583
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:23,080
Like night, do it, do it

584
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,080
I look you through the sky

585
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,080
I love you, I ain't gonna see you through

586
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
But now, what new world

587
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,080
The little picture finally comes true

588
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm out to let my wife

589
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,080
Give it some time

590
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,080
I'm living in fire

591
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:54,080
I'm out to let my wife

592
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,080
Give me some time

593
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,080
I'm living in fire

594
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,080
I remember exactly where I was

595
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,080
When I first heard that song, I played it

596
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,080
Almost every single night

597
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,080
On my turn table in my room

598
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,080
I was 14 or 15 years of age

599
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,080
Telephone line, electric light orchestra at the end of today's Charlie

600
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:24,080
We are taught that when we die

601
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,080
We move on to a better place

602
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,080
Fill with a bliss of unconditional love

603
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,080
Welcome to those who have gone before us

604
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,080
But some of us never complete our journey

605
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,080
Some of us stumble on our path to the light

606
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:44,080
Some of us remain imprisoned between worlds

607
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,080
Trust not by the living nor the dead

608
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,080
Never wasting me

609
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,080
