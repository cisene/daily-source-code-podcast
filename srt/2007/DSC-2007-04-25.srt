3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Got something to say?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Walk it with your fruit-whip log from GoDaddy.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's go.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's go.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's go.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's go.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Delta.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Serator.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
588.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In a world where TV networks, movie studios and record labels still think they can govern what you see in here.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses and make big media corporations

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
wet their tiny little pants.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
From Poncho, home of the world's most dangerous new content, comes the daily source code with Adam Curry.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We don't need no sticky and crispy.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Honest and kiss and curry.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Tell me, I know, I need you to know.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sometimes now forever.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I need it to say in the impossible way.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sometimes through my window.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I wanted to show how in the kitchen I found the sun.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
While you were right.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And if you want me so.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You better tell me so.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Because I want you to see the call of me that can't let go.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let me know.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I need it to try.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't want to go in by.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sometimes now you need to.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I never can say the way I wanted to say.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But do you ever do?

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So tell me, I know, all the things you've done.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sometimes now forever.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And if you want me so.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You better tell me so.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Because I want you to see the call of me that can't let go.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let me know.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Can't you see the sun?

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Can't only bring you down.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But do you ever do?

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But don't say, I don't stop it, stay.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But don't say, I know, all the things me have to do.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I needed to try as well as going by

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Sometimes now you'll need to

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I've never been saying the way I wanted to say

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But do you ever do you?

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I wanted to show how in the beginning I know

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That someone's not in the right

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And if you won't be so

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You better tell me something

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Because I want you to see the part of me

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I can't let go

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let me tell you

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh man, is that pretty?

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let me know

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Fireings, let me know

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The fun things and not worry

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Which means you can find it at quadshow.com

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Of course you'll find the link to their

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Artist page at

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The show notes for the show

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
DailySourceCode.com

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
By the way, some very cool you can do

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If you follow that link

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And you've registered with podshow

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You can collect all of their songs

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You do it by hitting get it

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And you can put it in your collection

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So whenever you want to hear it

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can go straight into your collection

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's like a bookmark really

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But it's a multimedia bookmark

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And then you can just play all the songs

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You can put it into a collection of other artists

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hey, cool shit

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Anyway, it's DailySourceCode

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Episode 588 coming to you from a very

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, it was a very sunny San Francisco

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Of course the sun is now gone down over the yard arm

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It is the evening, Tuesday evening

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So you're here in this Wednesday hopefully

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm on my west coast recording schedule

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And I'm feeling good

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I gotta tell you, I got to bed on time last night

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
10 30 11 o'clock

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I actually watched a little bit of news

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Which was a ton of waste

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I watched a David Letterman's monologue

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And I passed out

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And I woke up this morning

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Before the alarm clock went off

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Like 7, 10, 7, 15

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's funny

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I can actually program my brain

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And say I want to wake up at 7

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And at like 7

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will wake up

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Maybe 659 or 701

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Do you have that?

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I know a lot of people who can do that

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I wonder how we do that

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Lots of good feedback about the new format

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm so happy you guys are liking it

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And there's of course some suggestions

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And lots of people sign up to be savants

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
In the ongoing series of savants

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
People hawken their family members

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And saying they want to be savants

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Because their experts in a certain field

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This is all fabulous

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Because I'm going to take advantage of every single one of you

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And I've got a couple of pieces of feedback

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Privately and publicly

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And it's almost like a challenge

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You'll never be able to get a single

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I guess on every single day

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You'll never be able to pull it off

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm like

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Thank you

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I really enjoy that challenge

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Because I know I can

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I know that I am no more than a couple of phone calls away

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
From anybody I want to talk to

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm convinced of that

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Now the most people I'm interested in talking to

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Of course aren't famous people

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
They're not the people you see appear on CNN

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Or on MTV for that matter

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You know it's a people from our own world

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Our own savants

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And I love you

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And I will protect you always

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But so that's good

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And I will work very hard

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I'm not quite sure

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I think I still want to keep

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Completely football

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't want to have a guest

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Maybe I'll just do straight music a whole bunch of songs

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You know let's shake it up a little bit

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You guys seem to be enjoying something different

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So that's good

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let me see

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I wanted to thank

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Doxerals again for appearing on yesterday's show

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He of course posted a couple of links on his weblog

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He said that he felt

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He posted that he felt that he didn't do a really good job

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Explaining the issues or what he's working on

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Now the vendor

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What is it called?

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Vendor name system

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I understand because I've been reading his weblog

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So I know what he's talking about

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Basically a way for

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Customers who don't have a vendor yet

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Or who are just finding a vendor to figure out how to pay them

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Something like that

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But when Doc has it up and running

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sure we'll have him back on

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We'll talk about it

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So you guys

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You can't be lazy on me

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay, because I'm out there

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm working the guests

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm getting them in

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm getting them on the show

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And all of a sudden everything stops

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
There's no more phone calls

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Or almost no more phone calls

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
There's no more bits being sent in

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I mean you know

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It has to come

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't be too lazy

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Just be sitting back the whole time

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Do something, say something

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Or I'm going to have to continue playing this annoying jingle

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, I want you to call in

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And let me know what's going on

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Or if you have some feedback on a certain topic

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You know what to do

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm actually walking here

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm trying to pull up

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Where the hell is it?

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Shit

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I hope this is the

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Where do I put it?

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I hope this is the right one

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Only person who called in today

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I had a prolific program

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm here from San Francisco

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It seems that you are coming

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I think you're on Tuesday

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I would love to get into the other way

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
In person

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
In person

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You feel the same way about me

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes, I do

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There for me number is

206
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay, well, I won't play as a phone number

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So this is of course the downside of having all the savants in the continuing series

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Are we done with the number?

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
To see you this week

210
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm available any evenings

211
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
After 4-3 evening

212
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's my home from work

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah, so the problem is

214
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I wish I had time to hang out with everybody

215
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm here, we're so busy

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
My life is completely scheduled around meetings that we have at the office

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And of course a production of the daily source code

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll tell you, I wish I could only work on this show

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And that's the only thing I was doing all day long

220
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But on the other hand, I do enjoy all the other wacky shit that we're getting into

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We're working on some interesting stuff

222
00:10:46,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah, we've been working a lot on lowering our suck quotients

223
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And so you'll be hearing about some exciting ways that you can help us suck less

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And it doesn't matter whether you're a podcaster, a pod safe music artist

225
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Or an audience member, in fact that is in many ways preferable

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Because we need some help

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So that's the stuff we're working on

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And you'll be hearing about that in just a couple weeks

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How to help pod show suck less

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This is the new Jeff Smith jingle that we've rolled out for

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I still have to kind of learn the timing

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't need you to help us suck less

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Jeff, I love it, no

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay, let me see, had a couple of other things I wanted to talk with you about today

235
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, yeah, just regarding Docsurals and the whole web radio

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Link in the comments at dailysourcecode.com

237
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Statement from 365.com

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
About the copyright royalty board, the changes in pricing from music

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And I'm not going to read the whole thing of course I'll put a link to it in the show notes

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
If you haven't already seen it, Brian, no posted that

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But so here was an interesting part here

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Since live 365 aggregates all of the performances

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Stream through our service into a single report

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We will be paying millions of dollars to sound exchange

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
To administer our four quarterly reports when we actually do all the work

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
On top of that

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The new minimum fee would be more than triple live 365's royalty obligation for 2007

248
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And retroactively 2006

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Here comes Yahoo real networks in Pandora

250
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And so I guess we could lump a couple of the names in there

251
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let's just take those three

252
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We'll have minimum fees that exceed $50 million

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Although they're combined 2007 internet radio revenues

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Will not even approach $100 million

255
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So that's like a $50 million deficit

256
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So of course you can add last step

257
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
M to that and a whole bunch of services

258
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And as I reflected a bit more in the conversation

259
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I had with Doc

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It is a shame but not

261
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Because well let me put it this way

262
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I agree with him

263
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That programming music

264
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Very much like a DJ does in the clubs

265
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
A DJ

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's an art form

267
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And that's the art form I grew up with

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The art form I was schooled in

269
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's creating a vibe and of course that works very well with radio

270
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Because your audience is usually

271
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And a local geographical level

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So that's what I grew up with terrestrial radio

273
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So it's raining outside

274
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You play different records and when it's very sunny

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Outside stuff like that

276
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But all these themes and the order that the records appear

277
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's a very very very effective way

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Of creating great entertainment

279
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I just believe that the music industry

280
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Is a shooting themselves in the foot

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
For doing this, for making it

282
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Virtually unaffordable

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And I think it's just dumb

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And if anything

285
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I think that

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
They are

287
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Putting this type of pricing into effect

288
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Are

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Proving a huge disservice to society in general

290
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Because you should be able to hear

291
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This music

292
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It is art, it should you know web radio

293
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
In effect maybe it should be treated like a museum

294
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And maybe there should be some curator rules and stuff like that

295
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You know the shit that's in a museum

296
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Is more valuable than the music we're talking about

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm not saying that one is better than the other

298
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But you know there's a higher price tag on most pieces of art

299
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Than there is on MP3 files of songs

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But I think that music

301
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The soundtrack to our lives because that is one thing that

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Really resonated for both of us

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's important, it's important that that gets passed on

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's exposure and if terrestrial radio

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Doesn't have the bandwidth

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Literally to provide all of this music

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And web radio is one way to do that

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Then I do agree that it's very very important

309
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
For our

310
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
From a social standpoint

311
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Or from a cultural standpoint

312
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Not from a money-making standpoint

313
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
No, I don't know if that's going to help

314
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If we can do anything about it or not

315
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So be it

316
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So we did that one

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, I got this

318
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
A lot of people sent me this link

319
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This is fantastic

320
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah, I'm going to read this is from the BBC

321
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Let me just go to the email

322
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Send this to me Matt

323
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh

324
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You're going to love this if you hadn't heard about this

325
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This is nuts

326
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Singer Cheryl Crow has said

327
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
A ban on using too much toilet papers

328
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Should be introduced to help the environment

329
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Crow has suggested using only one square per restroom visit

330
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Except, of course, on those pesky occasions

331
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Where two or three would be required

332
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
While clearly she doesn't shit like a guy

333
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Are you crazy?

334
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Now

335
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
45-year-old who made the comments on her website

336
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Has just toward the US and a biodiesel powered bus to raise awareness about climate change

337
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I am all for the biodiesel bus

338
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's cool baby

339
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But

340
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This thing about the toilet paper

341
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Hmm

342
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I propose a limitation be put on how many squares of toilet paper can be used in any one sitting

343
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is

344
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You know, I met Cheryl Crow when she had

345
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Completely blown out hair

346
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And she was singing backups for Michael Jackson on the

347
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I was at the bad tour

348
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I was a very different girl back then

349
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
She was one of the band

350
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
She was one of the guys

351
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
She was burping and farting

352
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And she was funny and she was energetic

353
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And she was

354
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Not a girl who would restrict my paper usage

355
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
How am I outraged by this?

356
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
She's got more brilliant ideas

357
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
She's designed a clothing line with what she calls a dining sleeve

358
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The sleeve is detachable

359
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And can be replaced with another dining sleeve after the diner has used it to wipe his or her mouth

360
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So I guess instead of using paper napkins

361
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Actually, I think that's a pretty good idea

362
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Except why don't we use I mean we can reuse the sleeve after we've wiped off our mouth

363
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We can use the sleeve to wipe off our ass

364
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Of course the entire reason I even mentioned the story so I can play the jingle

365
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Let's find a chair

366
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
We got some great savants on the show today

367
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Because we'll be talking about a very hot news story

368
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Which has actually been alive for about a week now

369
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I can't believe we're still talking about it

370
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This is the voice mail that Alan Baldwin left for his 11 year old daughter

371
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And I gotta tell you

372
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The reason why I wanted to bring it up on the Charlie is because

373
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's a little sick of mainstream media and the way they're trying

374
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm like are all these parents so fucking great

375
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
All these parents or oh it never you

376
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You're the parent and you should never talk to your child like that

377
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And I gotta tell you I just it doesn't feel like

378
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Reality is being represented

379
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Regarding the story

380
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let me say it's a travesty this whole thing is taking place

381
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You know for a family to have to go through this that sucks

382
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So I've got some some cool people

383
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And major savants to talk about it

384
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But first let's revisit the voice mail just briefly

385
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You know

386
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You know

387
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You know

388
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You know

389
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You know

390
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You know

391
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You know

392
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You know

393
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You know

394
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You know

395
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You know

396
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You know

397
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You know

398
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You know

399
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I

400
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Know

401
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You know

402
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Before

403
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:37,000
to me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me,

404
00:20:37,000 --> 00:21:07,000
you know me, you know me, you know me, you know you, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know you, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know me, you know you, know me, you know

405
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,520
top's. They truly are savants of the human psyche and I thought the perfect

406
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,080
people to call today about this. Welcome Robin and Suzanne, Maiden of

407
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,800
Insight Works to the Daily Source Code. How are you guys doing?

408
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,600
We are doing great. Very well. Thank you. I'm so glad you guys could make it. I

409
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,000
appreciate you staying up late. You being on East Coast time, but you guys have

410
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,200
helped me in the past with, I said the human psyche, which of course is, that's a

411
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,160
very, very broad description of what you guys talk about. You want just for the

412
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,640
people who aren't familiar with Insight Works, just give us a brief synopsis of

413
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,200
the show and what you guys do on that? Well, we talk about Insight Insight

414
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:01,840
into ourselves and we miss fellow at Horrible in our website name. That's INSYTWORKS.com

415
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,720
and I thought it's like we're at the pocho so you can get it there. But we

416
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,400
talk about depth psychology. Suzanne is an active therapist and she's gone to

417
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,080
the Pacifica Graduate Institute and there's a lot of union work and depth

418
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,440
psychology and I'm just a lay person. I've done a lot of reading and we on

419
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,840
our show talk about how people function and using the depth psychology approach

420
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,840
and the things that are in the unconscious, how that manifests in the physical world.

421
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,440
So, when you hear this voicemail from Alec Baldwin, what was your initial reaction

422
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,720
the first time you heard? I don't know if you were together when you heard it

423
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,160
you heard it separately. What was your first reaction? Oh my god, I'd cringe. I just

424
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,720
cringe. Oh, me too. We have a 10 year old and I just couldn't believe it. Yeah, I mean,

425
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,880
you know, and lightly speaking, and when I say lightly, I just mean some of basic

426
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:07,400
therapeutic standpoint. I mean, it's clearly emotional abuse. There's no

427
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,120
question about that. But I think what you're looking at at a maybe something a

428
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,080
little bit deeper than that, like I'm guessing, and the that be right, is to

429
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,120
why he would do something like that. Well, here's my thought. What really struck

430
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,320
me, and Patricia and I heard it together, and I talked with a couple of my, I don't

431
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:37,560
really have any friends. So acquaintances about it. And I have to admit that in contrast

432
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:44,440
to everything I saw and actually your reactions as well on television, if you kind of, if

433
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:50,680
I look a little bit through the words in the tone, I understood him. And I think that

434
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,280
I too have been at times certainly that pissed off at my daughter who now is almost

435
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:04,880
17. You can't say anything she kicked my ass. But I certainly would have to say that

436
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:13,480
I too have in the past been guilty of speaking certainly in that type of tone, have been

437
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:19,280
that angry, and of course that anger probably was channeled from somewhere else at that

438
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,960
moment, and I think that's what's what's probably happening here as well. But everyone

439
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,640
seems so incredibly shocked, and I'm thinking myself, have the people that I'm seeing

440
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,280
respond to this, never ever spoken to their children like this, because I think I have to admit

441
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,640
that I have, and I've heard other parents say this as well.

442
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:45,240
Okay, and absolutely, and I guess that distinguishing factor is that, and I too have a child,

443
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,720
we have a little boy, and he's actually close to Alex Baldwin's daughter's age, and

444
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,920
have I lost my temper with my kid? Oh my gosh, have I raised my voice of my screen? Of

445
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:03,240
course. But the distinguishing factor is, have you called your kid really ugly names? Have

446
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,400
you been really threatening and intimidating? I don't mean threatening like, if you don't

447
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,680
do a, you're going to be grounded, or privileges are going to be taken away. That's

448
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,600
different. But the distinguishing factor is that he's like threatening her. He's like,

449
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,080
I'm going to come out there and blah, blah, straighten you out.

450
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,680
Yeah, but is that wrong? I mean, well, Suzanne, he was basically saying, I'm going to

451
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,560
get on a plane. The way I heard it, and maybe I'm just hearing it differently, is I'm

452
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,360
going to stop my life and come and straighten you out because you need help. And I've

453
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,680
been through this, by the way, with my daughter, the whole phone thing, where, you know,

454
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:44,240
they reject the call or it's, you know, everyone can, my daughter's on the phone all day.

455
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,000
Everybody can reach her, but when I call, I always get voicemail. You know, it's like, what's

456
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,080
going on with that? And it felt to me like I was saying, I'm going to take, I'm going to

457
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,280
stop everything. I have to fix you, which is, of course, dads are like that. You know,

458
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,520
so kids broken, got to go fix the kid. It felt to me, it, to me, it didn't feel like,

459
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,560
like it was going to go kick her ass or anything, but, you know, sit her down and have

460
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,480
to talk. Okay, but he didn't say we're going to sit down and talk about this. He called

461
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:16,800
her a rude, thoughtful, little pig who had no brain. Yeah. Okay, that's one of the things

462
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,800
that I took out of this was, yes, I get as angry and I have gotten as angry in this

463
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,680
frustrated sounds like you have. And Alex, you know, Alex Baldwin has, but I always go

464
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:34,160
after the behavior, I don't go after the person. And in this case, Alex went right

465
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,040
after the person. He called his daughter names. And I think that's very different than talking

466
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:48,080
about the behavior. And the next level that I'd like to take this to is sort of into what

467
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,720
did this trigger in him? Because it's obviously, you know, a phone call getting rejected,

468
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,400
like you've had done, that, that doesn't merit the response. And that's what people always

469
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,840
get surprised about is how people react to a seemingly small trigger. And that's where

470
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,880
Suzanne and I say it's triggering something in the unconscious. Yeah, this is deep for him.

471
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,040
This is very deep. This is triggering, you know, this type of rage, rage is old anger. When somebody

472
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,160
is fat out of control, rage, that's not new stuff. That's not the event itself. You got to look

473
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,880
back historically. What has gone on with him in the past? I mean, just some of the words that he

474
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,920
used, you know, he was obviously very angry. He was very frustrated. He was insulted. He can say

475
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:40,800
it has to be the last time he humiliated me. Right. So he felt humiliated and he felt attacked.

476
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:48,240
Now, were those things really, you know, appropriate for having his daughter reject a phone call?

477
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:55,840
You know, I think it's from a much deeper wounding from a long time ago, or maybe just a

478
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,560
collection of a lot of experience where he has been humiliated or attacked or insulted.

479
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:09,520
We're letting so out of control in his life that he's asking kind of his daughter to put him

480
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,920
that responsibility almost on her and saying, I'm going to come out there and straighten you out.

481
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,880
And this is going to be the last goddamn time he humiliated me. What else was going on in his life?

482
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,360
That feels so out of control. So let me just say a couple of things about that.

483
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,680
First of all, I got the distinct feeling that this was not the first time that she hadn't picked

484
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,520
up the phone by prior arrangement or something like that. So that could stem some of the frustration

485
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:43,280
could stem from that. I will say one other thing, as it comes to family behavior, our family,

486
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,280
particularly my daughter and I, and Patricia is, of course, completely opposite, which is why

487
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:56,080
our marriage has worked for 20 years. But we're very, we all three of us are very emotional people,

488
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,880
and we talk with a lot of motion, you know, where artists, performers, we're creative people.

489
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,920
And I think I've said much worse things than, you know, I've never called my daughter stupid,

490
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,960
because she's not stupid. But have I said things worse than, you know, then you're a pig? Yeah,

491
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:21,600
probably. And I think that does come down to what, you know, a family, you know, every family has

492
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,720
its own rules, its own behavioral patterns that are acceptable to them and how they speak to each other.

493
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,120
It may not sound nice on the outside, but, you know, I've seen families that have been together

494
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:38,000
very happily who just say the most terrific things to each other. Well, there are definitely

495
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,160
standards within the family, you know, that the people operate under, that to the outside world,

496
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:50,560
have different standards. So, you know, I can agree with you on that. So, and you guys, you know,

497
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,760
have a child as well, so that that makes it a lot easier to talk about this. What do you think

498
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,360
if, well, two things, I guess. First of all, what is a better way to approach these type of

499
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,200
situations with your kids, you know, and I'm not a big believer in huge kumbaya. I have to say,

500
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,120
write up front, you know, like, come on, let's sit down, let's talk about, you know, how, how can you

501
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,080
do that? And perhaps the telephone is just not the right instrument in general. And what should

502
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,120
Alec Baldwin do at this point? Really for the relationship with his daughter and forget everything else,

503
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:34,000
because obviously his life may be very together, but yeah, does he have some problems with his family?

504
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,680
Yeah, obviously. So, on those two topics, you know, what, what comparisons do to not fall into

505
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:48,160
this trap, which I obviously is not going to work, you know, I heard it, I was like, well, you know,

506
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,800
the kid is not going to respond to this. What can you do and what should Alec Baldwin do in

507
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,400
his particular case? Wow, well, let's take a second question first, which is what he,

508
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:05,760
where should he kind of go from here? And I think the first step is just to really talk the heck out of

509
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,760
this, with his, with his daughter. But I don't think that should be, I think there should be some

510
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,040
supervision there. What that looks like? I'm not really quite sure. Should there be a therapist? I don't

511
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:23,520
think it can be in his ex-wife, you know, that's obviously a pretty, um, it's a non-starter,

512
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:31,040
is what I'd call it. Yeah, yeah, that's a show stopper right there. So he really needs to just keep

513
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,600
communications. A third grade, some sense when we work with families like this, we're one

514
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,320
parent is more volatile. We could just email. Really? You know, that's just email each other for

515
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,760
right now, instead of doing the comb-by-offing, because the kid might be too resistant to sitting

516
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,600
actually down with him and talking about it. It might be safer to just do the email thing,

517
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:01,520
so that might be a place to start. Interesting. Then how to respond? Yeah, that's one thing that,

518
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:08,320
again, we recommend, um, in this type of situation. And then how do you even present from getting

519
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,920
there? But, you know, how did he get where he is right now? He hasn't checked his own stuff. He's

520
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:21,200
not a control. That's the thing that I go back to and in, in trying to fix the relationship with

521
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,880
the daughter or how do you communicate with the child at this point? Um, I think that's, that's

522
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,880
even trying to figure out a way to do that is almost a band aid to the, to the bigger problem.

523
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,240
Right, because Robin, this really, this is more of a symptom of a problem. His daughter is

524
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:45,840
not, the daughter's almost an honest issue. Right. I mean, you say, well, maybe with, you know,

525
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Christina, you've tried to call her, and again, she's readable to all of her friends, and then when you

526
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,320
try to call, she's not available. Um, and he had kids do that kind of stuff, of course they do.

527
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,880
And, you know, is there a problem there with that? Well, yeah, maybe okay, but God, his rage was just,

528
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:10,960
so to me, it was very disproportionate to the event. And I, I go back to, she's in and I always

529
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,400
talk about things and try and look at the world in a symbolic fashion. And so, you know, what was

530
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:22,640
the trigger in this? It was the daughter not answering the phone. So, symbolically, maybe, you know,

531
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:33,120
Alec is not getting his phone calls answered, you know, kind of a, in a, in a metaphorical way,

532
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,920
that, that, here he's trying to, you know, maybe get another, you know, another show, another movie,

533
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,440
another whatever, and he's putting this stuff out there, and nobody's calling him. So, that's a

534
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,440
very, that's a great analysis. I like that. Well, but it, I think in a very symbolic fashion,

535
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:59,840
maybe this was just a trigger that he's been waiting for the, not coming. Nobody's answering

536
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:06,320
and he just, and then he calls a daughter who, who maybe has done this also in the past, but maybe

537
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:14,000
he just, you know, it just comes to a head and it's triggering a reaction from all these other things.

538
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,080
And we're not, we're not privy in the news and everything else to all the details of his

539
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,760
environment of what's going on in his life. Obviously, there's a part of him that wants to control

540
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,120
his daughter. And that wants to be heard. Yeah. Pick up the phone, damn it. Yeah, you know,

541
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:36,080
I think you guys really, really nailed it with that one because I catch myself a lot.

542
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,320
I'll be, you know, busy, I'm doing stuff, you know, it can be stupid as like I'm trying to

543
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,880
configure something and it's not working and then someone will come upstairs, ask something

544
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,320
very benign and I'll snap, you know, and then, and now that I'm a little bit older, I actually

545
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,160
catch myself and say, oh, you know, sorry, I was just a complete asshole. That was not directed to

546
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,120
you, you know, and so I and Patricia really taught me a lot about that too because, you know, she

547
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,520
just being senior in years, you know, what already recognized this and she could just easily

548
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,240
shrug her shoulders instead of letting it explode into an event. But I think you're absolutely right

549
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,160
that, you know, it's completely symbolic and we don't know any of the backstory. And if anything,

550
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,400
I think the the Travis de Hairs that this, you know, that this recording was released completely out of

551
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,400
context, I think that's, that's really the most damaging thing that was done here is just to,

552
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,200
you know, to have this on public display to me seems like a really bad thing.

553
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,280
Right. And it's really, it is so easy to take it out of context because there's just so many things

554
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:49,040
we don't know. I mean, we can insert things and look at it, you know, symbolically that,

555
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,960
all right. So the the only thing I guess I just want to go out of this is that I personally don't

556
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,360
think that Alec Baldwin is a bad parent and, and it kind of bugged me, I have to say, you know,

557
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:06,240
just seeing all the news reports and it's, you know, and man on the street interviews and, oh,

558
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,640
you know, how the hell could he ever talk to his child like that and I'm like, well, you know,

559
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,720
I don't think he's a bad guy, but yes, I think he did on the head there.

560
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,680
Right, he's a bad parent and he and he and he and his daughter in other ways might have a

561
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,320
really strong bond and a great relationship. Well, I sure hope they do.

562
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:34,400
Yeah, I do too. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, guys. Well, listen, I really appreciate you weighing in on this

563
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,720
and and hopefully I can call on you more in the future when we have to deal with the

564
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:47,360
issues of the psyche. And everybody's my gosh. Everybody's my gosh. Yes, because there's lots of

565
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:53,520
it floating around. Yeah, including my own. Yeah, including my own. Right on, right on, we've got

566
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,960
baggage and we're proud of it. Damn it. He's hands with Louis Vuitton.

567
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,040
Exactly. I'm black and white. Hey, man, to me, it's indestructible, you know,

Nice, is that?

588
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,320
On the bio, on the pot safe music network, Angelic Kigio, the four-time Grammy-nominated, much celebrated

589
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:45,360
singer composer and performer, began in the Beninese port village of Cotonu, where she

590
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:50,160
launched a career at the age of six, the political turmoil in our country, led her to reload

591
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,360
relocate to Paris, the capital of world music.

592
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
Awesome.

593
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,920
That's really, that was really, really nice.

594
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:02,440
Hey, wasn't it nice to hear Robin and Susanne, I was listening to them speak together.

595
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,000
And they really, what a pair, man.

596
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,480
They fill each other in, and they're almost like a Bob and Ted news team.

597
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,920
Well, Robin, let me tell you, and yes indeed, Susanne, but it's natural, I really like that

598
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
a lot.

599
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,520
All right, so outside is beautiful right now.

600
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:26,520
The sun is completely set, so the city is in that orangeish glow, and like a blue dark sky,

601
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:32,240
it's fantastic, and just perfect for me to shut down the show and go to something else with

602
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
