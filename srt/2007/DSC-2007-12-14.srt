00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Hello, it's Chris Lane here from the Pods Zone. I could play the way, but that's not why I'm here.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,440
Although he's not here at the moment, Nick Cooper and myself would like to wish you, yes,

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,800
you, the one with the ear buds, looking befuddled at this audio bombardment of your programming.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,400
A very very Merry Christmas. If you don't celebrate Christmas, then have a fantastic time anyway.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, I guess I'll be able to be off then, until next time. Bye.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:33,760
Brothers and sisters are reading from the book of Adam, and so it came to pass in the fourth year

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,520
of the Daily Source Code that the podfather did find the numbers that were secret. And the numbers

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:52,480
that were secret were 600 and 4 score and 7 and 600 and 4 score and 8. And the podfather declared

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:01,200
that the numbers 687 and 688 shall be secret numbers and shall not be in the counting of the

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Daily Source Code. And the congregation was confused and such that the counting becomes 700,

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:18,880
but yet it was not 700 for the numbers of 687 and 688 had been skipped. And yet it was not so.

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:27,920
For we did celebrate the 700th episode of the DSC. And low, we give thanks for the Charlie

13
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,920
that the podfather has given on to us. Let us rejoice now for the DSC 700.

14
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:58,960
It is, come on Friday, everybody get ready to sing along. If the anthem that we all know

15
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,920
and put it in the song, right? Send them my names to tell me that you love me. I'll send it

16
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:14,080
in your face and then I'll do. I love to hear you horror lies when I'm between your eyes.

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,760
You blow your way to my face and let my lips embrace you. I'll send them a face and then I'll

18
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:35,760
do. I'll send them a face and then I'll do. I'll send them a face and then I'll do.

19
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,440
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass. Then the next generation radio

20
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,440
content in my ears. I like to think I'm flying into the future.

21
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,080
I pull it up with a million trucks. Look at the smell and the feeling like a million bucks.

22
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,480
Pass the bottle, the heat is on. We're in a hot-a-loss, looking at cheats and sound. What's wrong?

23
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
The club in the movies floor. And I'm looking for a thick young lady to pull. One suicide.

24
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,440
We can't get a matter to pay and take notes to the brand new days.

25
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,960
I need an opportunity to stop. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home.

26
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:42,960
We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home.

27
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:18,960
We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home.

28
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:34,960
We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home.

29
00:04:34,960 --> 00:05:04,960
We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We're not home. We

30
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
We're not home.

31
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:54,960
It's like that, it's like that, it's the perfect match of our round number, like 700 DJs

32
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
on us to do.

33
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,960
It's like a hurricane.

34
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:08,960
It's the first by a massive town bus cop, new to print, sports, warrants, and winger.

35
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Yeah, everybody, how you doing?

36
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
It is the data source code.

37
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,960
I'm back in the curry manner and the affluent suburb of Surinone is Gilford.

38
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
We're on the west side.

39
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,960
Major delays coming in from New York, actually from Liberty Airport.

40
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,960
As you know, Newark Airport has been renamed to Liberty Airport, Liberty Airfield.

41
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
I think field sounds better.

42
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Hey, no problems getting out of the country.

43
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
That's for sure.

44
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Except, of course, for the massive snowstorm that hit the northeast and did give us some snow and some freezing rain and some ice in the New York Metro area.

45
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Actually, that wouldn't have delayed me that much.

46
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,960
We're not that the Virgin Atlantic air crew.

47
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
They did something really dumb.

48
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,960
They had the lost power while we were at the stand.

49
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,960
The external power unit failed.

50
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
And so they had to restart it.

51
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Now, there's one thing that you learn as an airman when you train to be a pilot.

52
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,960
When you're going to start anything, anything at all it has to do with electricity.

53
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,960
So whether it's the engine that's going to be sourcing electricity or if you're connecting an external power source,

54
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,960
you turn off all of the cockpit electronics.

55
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
It's just a rule.

56
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Because you have a good shot of blowing out your radios or some other piece of equipment.

57
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
And I could see them trying to start it.

58
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,960
The plane was literally, it was like they were turning the key.

59
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
And the lights would come on.

60
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Everything would go off and then it would go dead again.

61
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,960
And the captain came on and said he was trying to restart it.

62
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
I'm like, man, I hope you turned off your shit.

63
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
They got the power running.

64
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
Oh, well, we have some malfunctions here in the cockpit.

65
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,960
So now we have to have ground engineering come aboard.

66
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
So they actually had to replace some bits and bobs.

67
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,960
And we finally got off three hours late almost.

68
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,960
And of course, because we were late, there was an hour waiting on the tarmac at Heathrow.

69
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,960
In order for us to get a stand, which was, I guess, a lift ons are some other company taking over.

70
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,960
It doesn't matter because I don't remember anything of the flight except for sleeping.

71
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,960
And I did wake up briefly when we all had to put our seat belts on because of severe turbulence.

72
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
It was kind of fun.

73
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
The roller coaster type turbulence where you would drop.

74
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
And you'd feel a little bit of weightlessness come in.

75
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,960
And you could literally hear people go, woo, woo.

76
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Like we're on a roller coaster ride.

77
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Anyway, it was fun being New York.

78
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
I do miss her.

79
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
I'm going.

80
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Adam Curry.

81
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Adam Curry.

82
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
See one hundred.

83
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
He's your New York.

84
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
This man.

85
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
We all miss you.

86
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Oh, man.

87
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
I wish I knew who you were.

88
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Yaman.

89
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Good times.

90
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
I miss New York myself.

91
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,960
And I left too early because the annual concert.

92
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
How could I?

93
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,960
How could I have scheduled my life not around this?

94
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Hi, Adam.

95
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
This is Jan from theonswell.com.

96
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,960
And many other places on the next.

97
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
I just wanted to say it.

98
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,960
You're still in town on the 17th, which is upcoming Monday.

99
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,960
You should try to go and see if you have it if you want to go and concentrate.

100
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
He's having a concert.

101
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Check it out.

102
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Look at it.

103
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
It's at the time of that comment on that.

104
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
All right.

105
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Take care.

106
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
I love you.

107
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Take care.

108
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,960
And I'll see you at the concert.

109
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Yeah.

110
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Bye.

111
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Grab.

112
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Oh, man.

113
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
That completely slipped my mind.

114
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Second year in a row that I have not made the infamous David

115
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Epilito Christmas slash New Year's concert.

116
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Very bummed about that.

117
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,960
But on the other hand, I am happy to be home with my girls.

118
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Finally, I think I'm going to be here at home.

119
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Through Christmas.

120
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Maybe even through New Year's if we can think it.

121
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:51,960
I've got a lot of response about my, my being on the Homeland Security, TSA, Customs, Border

122
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Protection Agency.

123
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Look out list.

124
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Which means for the next 40 years, 4-0.

125
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Unless we change something in government, I basically will be, well, I can't really

126
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
call it harassed.

127
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Because they're not harassing me.

128
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
These guys are just doing their job.

129
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
It's the computer system that's all fucked up.

130
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
The fact that that exists.

131
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,960
There's an automatic targeting system that gives you a score based upon everything from

132
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Department of Motor Vehicles to the IRS.

133
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,960
And if you hit that score, well, then they've just got to interrogate you.

134
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Lots of comments about that.

135
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Hi, Adam.

136
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
This is Jonathan New York.

137
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Hey, David.

138
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,960
I just started listening to DSC699.

139
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,960
And you were just driving your deal.

140
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,960
You went through at New York Airport.

141
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
And you said you were disappointed.

142
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Disappointed.

143
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,960
I mean, what you've described must be illegal.

144
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,960
I know we have to worry about Homeland Security.

145
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
But this still is the United States.

146
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,960
And your man of means.

147
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,960
And so you should, so I'd like to see the government.

148
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,960
I mean, the ACLU, I think, would love to take your case.

149
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:04,960
It's so obviously a gross trust test on your rights as an American.

150
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,960
And so I, you know, I just, it's not just annoying or disappointing.

151
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
It sounds to me, it's totally illegal.

152
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,960
And so it sounds to me also like with the great test case.

153
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I mean, we've seen over the last several years an erosion of our rights.

154
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Slowly, more and more in the name of security.

155
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
And I think we have to put a stop to it.

156
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,960
And it's been done to you as so illegal that it would make a great test case.

157
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Anyway, hope you do that.

158
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
Thanks to the daily source code, Adam.

159
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
I love you, Adam.

160
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Oh, bye.

161
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Oh, baby, I love you too.

162
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
Send naked pictures.

163
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,960
And I don't want to be a test case of anything.

164
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
I'm sick and tired of being tired.

165
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,960
I've spent so much of my own money on fighting laws.

166
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,960
The most recent one was, of course, the,

167
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:02,960
the attempt and the successful attempt I might add to uphold creative comments as a valid copyright.

168
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
It cost me a lot of money.

169
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
You know, lawyers and fees and all that shit.

170
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Even though I won, I didn't get any damages.

171
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
So I'm tired of doing that.

172
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
I'm tired of it.

173
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,960
I'd rather use this show, which for me is pretty much free.

174
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,960
ACLU, by the way, the American Civil Liberties Union is all over this.

175
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Reading from a post on there on their site, which I'll link to in the, in the show notes at daily source code.com.

176
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,960
It appears that the Department of Homeland Security has violated not only congress's ban on risk

177
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,960
assessments, but also the private, the privacy acts notification requirements said Steinhardt of ACLU.

178
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:45,960
At the very least, DHS has violated the spirit of the law and the ethical obligation to vet a program like this through congress

179
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,960
and through full public and democratic debate and control.

180
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:56,960
So the ACLU has filed official comments calling on the Department of Homeland Security not to implement the program, which, of course, they did.

181
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
So they're all over this.

182
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
They're working on it.

183
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:06,960
And, you know, again, it's, to me, it's not a problem that, that I show up on a score somewhere and they want to question me.

184
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,960
What is a problem is that this happens continuously.

185
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,960
There's no way for them to put into the system.

186
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Guys, okay.

187
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
All right.

188
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
You can kind of trust this guy.

189
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
Kinda.

190
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Because of course, no one really trusts me.

191
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Just take one look at me.

192
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,960
So that's the real, that's the privacy here is, is that you can't get off this list.

193
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
In fact, it's not really a list.

194
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
It is, it's a query.

195
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:37,960
It's a query across hundreds of databases from many different federal, state and even tribal databases.

196
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Whatever the hell those might look like.

197
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,960
And the ATS, the automatic targeting system.

198
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
It's almost like a Google page rank.

199
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,960
You know, hey, I got a high page rank today on the automatic targeting system.

200
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,960
So once again, time to fuck with Adam at the border.

201
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous.

202
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,960
And of course, there should be a way to contest the information that is in these databases.

203
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
That would be a request under the Privacy Act.

204
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
That appears not to be possible.

205
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,960
The only thing you can do is file a freedom of information act.

206
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,960
And of course, under the, I'm sure under the Patriot Act or some other fucked up law,

207
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,960
you're not allowed to actually get that information and contest it.

208
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
So I'll just have to live with that.

209
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,960
But that will give me lots of material for the show for the next 40 years.

210
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Yeah, I'm so Jerry Alexander and Ross Vegas.

211
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,960
I wanted to talk to him just listening to 699 from the daily source code.

212
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,960
And, you know, you just got actually a positive.

213
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,960
You just got done talking about the Homeland Security issues that you had.

214
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,960
First of all, I have, I want to apologize about that.

215
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,960
I think that that must have really sucked.

216
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
You know, you, you are American citizen.

217
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,960
And you have to spend a lot of time getting, you know,

218
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,960
you know, we all know you're not threat the Homeland Security.

219
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,960
But at the same time, I do have some other points that I would like to just kind of throw out there.

220
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:07,960
And obviously not meaning to piss you off, but this kind of sparse some interest in myself, you know.

221
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,960
Okay, well, hold on. First of all, you know, need to apologize, dude.

222
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,960
You know, I'm a young cadudal band, you just like you.

223
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,960
So we're both in this boat together.

224
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,960
So you don't have to apologize on behalf of the American people or anything like that.

225
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,960
You don't live here. You are, you are American citizen.

226
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Let me just say one very important thing.

227
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,960
I pay income taxes in the United States.

228
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,960
I am, I have, worldwide, I have to file my income taxes.

229
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Any money I make and I do make money in the United States.

230
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I pay taxes over in the United States.

231
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Income tax, capital gains tax.

232
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
It's all paid in the United States.

233
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
It's all above board. It's all there.

234
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,960
So whether I live there or not, I am certainly contributing to society.

235
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,960
And of course, I'm paying for some fucking bullets in the desert.

236
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
You do not live in the States.

237
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,960
First of all, that's a little different, I think.

238
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
And I want to.

239
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,960
It's funny because, you know, Steve leads my buddy from the old MTV days.

240
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
And now works at serious satellite radio.

241
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
And we were on the same flight.

242
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,960
He said, oh, well, you know, it's your travel patterns that set it off.

243
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Bullshit. Bullshit.

244
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Has nothing to do with travel patterns.

245
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Well, because you travel a lot, you get this treatment.

246
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
That's nothing to do with that.

247
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,960
I mean, I should be fucking rewarded for what I'm doing.

248
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,960
We have over 100 people in our company that we employ.

249
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,960
They're all working in paying taxes in the United States.

250
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,960
As you get a fucking metal for that part.

251
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
You sort of are different.

252
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,960
And you travel back and forth a lot.

253
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,960
I think those two things alone are interesting enough.

254
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,960
And with, you know, for someone who doesn't know you from Tom Dick or Harry.

255
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:52,960
It would have happened to your huddle masses coming in through through New York, through the island.

256
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Elis Island.

257
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Elis Island.

258
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Elis Island.

259
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
What, what have happened to that?

260
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Where we welcome you with open arms.

261
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Please.

262
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,960
You know, Steve, they would think, okay, with that sort of weird.

263
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
You don't have a business card on you.

264
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
I remember that.

265
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,960
That was the first time I had a business card with me every single time after that.

266
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,960
In fact, this time, they asked me for a business card and said,

267
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Yeah, go ahead.

268
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
You already have five.

269
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
I mean, it's like, these guys aren't doing anything.

270
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,960
And actually, you know, I've replayed this movie several times in my head.

271
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
These guys, they don't, they're just asking.

272
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
They're just trying to assess if I'm a threat.

273
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Something pops up.

274
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Some kind of flag.

275
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
They don't, they just ask and stuff.

276
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,960
They just look in it at all kinds of documentation, you know,

277
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
to see if something's out of order.

278
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
That's all that it is.

279
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
They're not actually doing anything with it.

280
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,960
They're writing stuff down on pieces of paper,

281
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,960
scrap paper with a ballpoint pen.

282
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Eh?

283
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,960
Hello.

284
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
You can tell I'm home.

285
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
So they're writing stuff down on pieces of paper.

286
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
There's no filing system.

287
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,960
They're just doing it just to see if I slip up or say something that they don't like.

288
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
That's all that's going on here.

289
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,960
I mean, I know you know, you see, you're not threat to all that security.

290
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,960
You might get threat to the, you know, to what the agenda of some of the other,

291
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,960
you know, politicians, which is a great thing.

292
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Ah, yes.

293
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Now I think you've hit something.

294
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,960
Isn't it coincidental that ever since I really became a

295
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,960
staunch supporter of Ron Paul that this has started happening?

296
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Is that just coincidence?

297
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
I don't know.

298
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
You might have to read the book.

299
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,960
I think that there are reasons, obviously, that you are getting

300
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,960
chosen to be on this list.

301
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
And unfortunately, that's a pretty negative situation for you.

302
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,960
But what if the guy next to you is on the list and, you know, he is a threat?

303
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
No, that's okay.

304
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Of course, I'm not against, you know, security and checking people.

305
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,960
I am against the fact that I've been checked four times now in a row.

306
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
The so-called random checks.

307
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Yeah, I'm against that.

308
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
Yes, I am.

309
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,960
And it makes me feel very unwell-comb.

310
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,960
So, you know, you have to be able to be approved at some point.

311
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
It just, that capability has to be in there.

312
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,960
I think that you have to have, maybe not exactly what's going on.

313
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
It's obviously not a refined program.

314
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,960
It needs, you know, the bugs, bugs work out of it.

315
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,960
But I got to tell you, man, I, at least are doing something.

316
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,960
And, you know, we're in a pretty pretty fucked up situation here in the

317
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Ivy State, not just with a presidency.

318
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,960
A lot of policies and things of that nature.

319
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm glad you're not doing a political show.

320
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,960
But, at the same time, education for, for everyone here is very important,

321
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,960
especially for people in other countries that think we're a bunch of assholes here in the

322
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
States.

323
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,960
We're not, you know, I mean, there are assholes here, but, you know, there's assholes in France

324
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
and everywhere else around the world.

325
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Not just to pick on France, no French, you don't love you.

326
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
Anyways, sorry about that, dude.

327
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,960
I know that I've got a suck in knowing that you're going to get that every single

328
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,960
time you come into the States that blows.

329
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
So, hopefully, you can get that fixed.

330
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Post some strange, man.

331
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Call, uh, Julie Brown, downtown Julie Brown, maybe she can fix it for you.

332
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Oh, yeah.

333
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Yeah.

334
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Yeah. Oh, that'll help.

335
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Um, look, you know, this is kind of the propagation of the, of the war on

336
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Terri, you know, that there are people who hate us.

337
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,960
That's not really true in my experience.

338
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
People don't hate us, you know.

339
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,960
There's, uh, God knows how this came about.

340
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,960
And whatever we've been doing was fine for the past five years.

341
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,960
And now in the six year, we've got to put this new automatic targeting system in.

342
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Why?

343
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Now, and there is no absolute security.

344
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Maybe a good idea would be not to fucking other people's countries.

345
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Get the fuck out of there.

346
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Maybe that would be an idea.

347
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Maybe then people wouldn't be so pissed off at us.

348
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
Just a thought.

349
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Oh, you remember, um, remember the, uh,

350
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,960
girl slash woman who called in about, uh, her husband having some kind of weird virus

351
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,960
where Amy max voice appeared, uh, or not didn't appear.

352
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Started playing or it was, was audible on his computer.

353
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,960
And, and she didn't know she thought I was a virus or a bug or something.

354
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,960
And, and I, of course, immediately drew the conclusion that her husband was searching for porn

355
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,960
to come across Amy Mac, uh, she's called in now with a response.

356
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Um, this is Eric Teflon, Iowa again.

357
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,960
I'm the one who had the husband that had Amy Mac's voice mysteriously showing up on his computer.

358
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
And so it's a great technique so long.

359
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,960
I've been so far behind on my podcast because I just had my computer shut off.

360
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
I was doing so many other things with the holidays season.

361
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,960
But, um, I have a few different facts on how this happened.

362
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Okay.

363
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
He actually didn't have the internet of all.

364
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
So no, he was in search of the porn.

365
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
Mm-hmm.

366
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Um, he was playing like a video game or something.

367
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Like one of the simulation games or something.

368
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Stimulation games?

369
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Um, that's all he had open.

370
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,960
And, um, you know, I did the virus checking on his computer.

371
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
I had like 40 some viruses.

372
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,960
So I don't know what's one of those, but he didn't even have the internet open.

373
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Um, and I know we've got-

374
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,960
I love these type of bug reports.

375
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Uh, he didn't have the internet open.

376
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Uh, what you mean is he was not using a web browser probably or internet explorer.

377
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,960
Uh, but I'm pretty sure that his computer was connected to the internet.

378
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Because these days, that's pretty typical.

379
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
If you have a DSL or a cable motor, you're not dialed up.

380
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,960
So you are connected and the internet is actually communicating with your computer.

381
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
And any program running on your computer can communicate with the internet.

382
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,960
So it's not just the web browser.

383
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
And it's not that I expect you to know this stuff.

384
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,960
But it's, uh, it just always amazes me.

385
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Uh, how people think this stuff actually works.

386
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Which is fine because you don't need to know how it works.

387
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,960
What we need to, what we need to do is figure out how to get rid of this, uh, so-

388
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
Called virus or bug or whatever.

389
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,960
And are you sure your husband wasn't searching for porn?

390
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,960
You don't even seem to know what game he was playing.

391
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,960
So, um, the wireless in our house.

392
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
So it's always on wireless.

393
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
There you go.

394
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
I don't- I don't know what's tell you.

395
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Since you're really weird and that's really all I have to say.

396
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Um, but since I have been catching up, um,

397
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,960
you did have a caller who called me from New Hampshire.

398
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,960
And I just want to thank you for your shit because Iowa, where I live,

399
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,960
is actually the first, um, of the caucuses.

400
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,960
Um, so, um-

401
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

402
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
All right.

403
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
Finish up.

404
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,960
Really, Iowa is probably the most important, um, state-to-end, um,

405
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
as far as presidential election goes.

406
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,960
But, you know, maybe even a little partial.

407
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,960
Anyway, Adam, um, have a good day.

408
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
And, uh, I love you.

409
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,960
I love it when you say it like that.

410
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,960
I did watch the, uh, a piece of the Iowa debate, which is kind of fun,

411
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,960
because it was, uh, like a PBS, uh,

412
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
hold on a second.

413
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Let me see what that is.

414
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
One second.

415
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Okay.

416
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
I can't take that now.

417
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
No time whatsoever.

418
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Okay.

419
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
So I think I figured this out with the Amy Mac thing.

420
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Um, so first of all, uh, here's what I want you to do.

421
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Now go to the computer that your husband had the problems with.

422
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,960
You might want to pause this for a second, uh, while you walk over.

423
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,960
You at home can do this as well.

424
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,960
It does, I have figured out how this kind of virus thing he works.

425
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Uh, so open, uh, you have to open.

426
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
It doesn't work with Firefox.

427
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Open up Internet Explorer, uh, a way for just a second.

428
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Again, you can pause this.

429
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,960
So if it takes a bit longer for it to open up on your computer now,

430
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,960
I want you to close it, but not by selecting, uh, file exit, uh, whatever it is.

431
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
I want you to click on the closed button on the, uh, in XP, and I think in VISTA,

432
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
it's the big red, uh, red X button.

433
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
Okay. So you've done that now, right?

434
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,960
Now go to your, um, volume control.

435
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,960
There should be a speaker icon in, uh, in your, what they call the task bar.

436
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Uh, down at the bottom of your screen.

437
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,960
There should be a little speaker, uh, icon there.

438
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,960
You want to click on that. You want to, uh, I think right click.

439
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,960
So it brings, uh, no, just click on it. Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

440
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Just click on it. So you get the volume control.

441
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
The volume slider. Okay.

442
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,960
Now you want to, uh, bring the volume down about halfway.

443
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Okay. Now push it up all the way to the top again.

444
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,960
And now click on the desktop.

445
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,960
If you can, as close to the middle as possible, click on it three times.

446
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Ready? One, two, three.

447
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Oh, it worked.

448
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
I hear Amy Mack.

449
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,960
It's a bug.

450
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Hey, Amy.

451
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Hey, Adam, it's Amy Mack.

452
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Today we're going to be standing.

453
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
So go ahead and get yourself situated.

454
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Oh, crap.

455
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,960
I just feel like you're going to be doing a type of jumping jack.

456
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,960
So bring your right leg forward and your left leg back.

457
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Okay.

458
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
And then switch.

459
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
You're also going to swing your arms as well.

460
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
But with the opposite arm going forward.

461
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,960
So right leg forward and left arm forward.

462
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
And then switch.

463
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Okay. Great.

464
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Now 10 quick ones.

465
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Ready, go.

466
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Now you should be lunging just enough to fill your butt squeeze with every jump.

467
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Yeah, I feel squeezed.

468
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Squeeze.

469
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Breathe.

470
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Squeeze.

471
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
And relax.

472
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Great job.

473
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
Well, until next time.

474
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Amy Mack.

475
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
She's not a bug.

476
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,960
She's a feature just one of my favorite women.

477
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Hey, Adam.

478
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
This is the divas from TheDivaCast.com.

479
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
Wishing you a Merry Christmas.

480
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
Happy holiday.

481
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Happy Hanukkah.

482
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Amy, know what the hell?

483
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Happy best of us from the rest of us down here in George Adam.

484
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,960
I don't know if that was sexual or not.

485
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
But I'd like the way you guys laughed about it.

486
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Thank you.

487
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
DivaCast.

488
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Hey, it's episode number 700 of the daily source code, which means we're celebrating.

489
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Nothing, you know, I don't have any like, you know,

490
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
I didn't bring any brownies or cookies or anything for you all.

491
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,960
But I did bring something very special that comes from our friend in Holland.

492
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,960
Because it also is another...

493
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,960
Jesus Christ.

494
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
Shut up.

495
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Go away.

496
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,960
It is also another special occasion.

497
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,960
Today marks the 100th episode of Young Pullet's Hit Test.

498
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
Play along.

499
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
Adam Curry.

500
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
I Adam.

501
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Who are you ready to be stumped?

502
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,960
Because he used a good test with Young Pullet.

503
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
Hit Test.

504
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Number one.

505
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
One, one.

506
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
One hundred.

507
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Hey, Adam.

508
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,960
This is the anniversary episode of the Hit Test.

509
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Sure is.

510
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,960
It's number 100 and it all started almost three years ago on January 22, 2005.

511
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,960
And those three years many things have happened.

512
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,960
If you talk about me producing and recording the Hit Test,

513
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,960
then I've done that from three different studios in three different homes.

514
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,960
I've done it from our location.

515
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,960
I've done it from a train and I've done it in a plane.

516
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,960
If you look at the people I've done it with, then I've done it with match.

517
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
I've done it with Peter.

518
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
I've done it with Adam.

519
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Me feel an Alexander from Curry and the crew.

520
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
I've done it with Kevin, the announcer guy.

521
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,960
I've also done it with Dave, the voice of the Hit Test.

522
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Quite a list there, Young.

523
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,960
And there's also a lot of stuff themed.

524
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
There's been a lot of themed hit tests.

525
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,960
I've done it with 70s, 80s, a few artists, a lot of stuff.

526
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,960
And, well, of course, this one is themed as well.

527
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
I hope you figure it out.

528
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
We're going to start with intro number one.

529
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,960
Ross out.

530
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Here we go.

531
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
Test number one.

532
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
One.

533
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
One.

534
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
One.

535
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
One.

536
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
Off.

537
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Oh yeah.

538
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
Know it well.

539
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,960
That would be a 50 pound.

540
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,960
Me and Mrs. Jones.

541
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
I wonder what the theme is, Young.

542
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Me and Mrs. Jones.

543
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Number two.

544
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
That's a hard one.

545
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
Crap.

546
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
I have to give up.

547
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
And number three.

548
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Oh, easy.

549
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
Boom.

550
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Boom.

551
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
That's Andy Gold.

552
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,960
Never let a slip away.

553
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Talk to my baby on the television.

554
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
What is it?

555
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Mub songs.

556
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
And I know you have them all at them.

557
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
You should have at least.

558
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Kind of.

559
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
What was number two?

560
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Well, this one, like I said, is themed.

561
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,960
There's one person behind these three songs.

562
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,960
And that is Lady Patricia.

563
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
It's a favorite song.

564
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
You're wife.

565
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
She selected these three songs.

566
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960
That's right.

567
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
And the first one.

568
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,960
The first answer is from when it all began between the two of you.

569
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
Oh, just.

570
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Number one.

571
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
One.

572
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
You're talking to my wife behind my back.

573
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Billy Paul, one of those guys.

574
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
And it was still very secretive.

575
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,960
Me and Mrs. Jones.

576
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,960
Me and Mrs. Jones.

577
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
Yeah, that's right.

578
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
These are our songs.

579
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Mrs. Jones.

580
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Mrs. Jones.

581
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
Mrs. Jones.

582
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,960
We got a thing.

583
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Go in on.

584
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,960
The song from 1973, me and Mrs. Jones.

585
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Billy Paul.

586
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
I mean, you played it song for her.

587
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Yeah, I'm ready.

588
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,960
You've got a thing going on.

589
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
What was the second one?

590
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
And this is answer number two.

591
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Oh, Roger Stewart.

592
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
Ten more in the first one.

593
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Watch to it.

594
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,960
I don't know what day it was when you walked to the room.

595
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
You're in my heart.

596
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
You're in my soul.

597
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
You're in my heart.

598
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,960
You're in my soul.

599
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
You're in my heart.

600
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,960
You're in my heart.

601
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
You're in my best friend.

602
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
You're in my soul.

603
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
It was just kind of hard to get in the intro.

604
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
First of all.

605
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,960
That's right.

606
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,960
That's right.

607
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
That's right.

608
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Got it.

609
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,960
Watch the words.

610
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
You're in my heart.

611
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
That's cool.

612
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
The final acclaim.

613
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
And this is the final answer.

614
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,960
There's another one.

615
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Classroom number 138.

616
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Some from 1978.

617
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,960
And the gold never let us slip away.

618
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,960
The song you both like.

619
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Yes, right man.

620
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Very much.

621
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
I'm told.

622
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
That's true.

623
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,960
And the gold from 1978.

624
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
And the gold from 1988.

625
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
And the gold from 1988.

626
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
And the gold from 1998.

627
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,960
The gold from 1998.

628
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,440
Gold from 1978's and never let her slip away and whenever you hit a song

629
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,120
Patricia told me we got in your day cannot go wrong anymore and that's it for

630
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,760
this anniversary episode number 100s I know you had them all at them at least I

635
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:11,440
really loved to create 100 more of them so next week I'll be back for the next one hit

636
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,200

679
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:57,440
well if anybody is in the rally Durham area and wants to attend this party they can go to reaching

680
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,760
for the city dot net and there I'll have a link to instructions on how to get to the party and what's

681
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,320
going on at the party and things like that it should be fun and a lot of support for doctor

682
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:15,360
Ron now I had a little bit of a downer with this as well and after I was asked to protest this event

683
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:24,080
my mother called and of course I was not always a downer so I told her and I could almost steal

684
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,760
for eyes glazing over which he said Ron Paul who's that that's supposed to mean something to me

685
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,440
oh no and at that point it hit me that we have a long road ahead of us in getting Ron Paul

686
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,520
even to the nomination my mom represents for better or worse a large portion of the voters out there

687
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,040
that really can only tell you the the front runners that they hear on the news i'll tell me

688
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,760
can probably tell you about Hillary or Obama or Romney and look at how close if she even knows who

689
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,800
hook it is I don't know I did try to educate her a little bit and at that point she told me well

690
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,520
you know I really have to go to Walmart so I didn't get very far obviously but anyway we got

691
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,560
a long road ahead of us but the money the support we're seeing it grows so got to got to

692
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,600
stretching along there got to keep going forward with that but anyway yeah if anybody

693
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:17,280
that listens to the DSC is in the Raleigh Durham area on Sunday December 16th please come out there

694
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,920

695
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,560
situation and remember reaching for the city dot net I had to link there to the information

696
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,360
the party so with that Adam Curry keep up the good faith and I'll talk to you later man

697
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,960
alright man thank you so much and thank you for for participating in in the drive for Ron Paul

698
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:46,960
that's right this this coming Sunday the 16th of December it is the anniversary of the Boston

699
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,760
Tea Party so we've got a Tea Party going on on our own we're gonna we're gonna show him what

700
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,440
was boss you know I'm saying Tea Party of seven dot com or you can find it from Ron Paul

701
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,200
2008 dot com and we want to drop another money bomb we only really need about two two and a

702
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,000
half million dollars more of course we'll be fine to make the twelve million dollar milestone

703
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,360
for this quarter which should be more than enough to just blast out I mean I think that what hasn't

704
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,080
happened yet is they haven't started really using the money on advertising so they're they're

705
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,120
getting ready to do that I would believe I got an email from a Jonathan the finance director

706
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,560
with the campaign so I got to call him I'll see if I can reach him today and find out how things

707
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,320
are going and of course you'll see me posting all the way up until and through Sunday to remind

708
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,080
people this is the perfect opportunity to support Ron Paul and I know exactly what you're saying

709
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,360
because I did have the TV on the hotel room while I was in New York and even in the in the opening

710
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,560
graphic montages and what we call a leader in the bills you're the leaders when they're talking

711
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:56,560
about you know the debate or anything about the the presidential race essentially and they'll show

712
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,120
you know some candidates and you're right Ron Paul has even show up in those and notice how could

713
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:08,560
be by the way I'm telling you everything in my body every bone says they're setting that guy

714
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,000
up for a humongous fall I'm not quite sure why I feel that but it just feels like it

715
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,840
so and also isn't the Ron Paul blimp how we do on that did they did they get enough mud yes

716
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:29,920
here you go we're flying 923 a.m. Friday December 14th this is fantastic

717
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,520
and let's see thanks everyone for your support in reaching our first goal of $200,000 the

718
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,000
blimp will fly for the tea party as the next step we need to receive 400,000 total sponsors

719
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,880
by December 21st to keep the blimp in the air through the New Hampshire primaries. Wow this is great

720
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,040
this is going to get a lot of news and and it looks beautiful I'm not quite sure how big it is let me

721
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,920
see are they they're not broadcasting yet not yet they have what is it just in TV set up on this page

722
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,880
Ron Paul blimp.com what a fantastic idea this will definitely make some noise and get some exposure

723
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,360
and you know it's it's going to be very interesting to see these elections remember

724
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,760
it just posting about this stuff just sending in money it's not enough you actually have to

725
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,440
get up off your ass and you have to go and vote so if you're not registered as a Republican

726
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,320
or if you need to change your party affiliation there's deadlines for that stuff you can find

727
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:33,120
that information quite easily the Ron Paul's website but that is what it actually takes and I

728
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:38,080
have to believe that you know the amount of people that actually vote the percentage is so small

729
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,720
anyway that we actually might be able to pull something very interesting off and boy wouldn't that

730
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,680
wouldn't that really surprise the mainstream media wouldn't that wouldn't that turn some heads

731
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,480
I think it's I think it's absolutely of course I think anything is possible

732
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,120
but I do I do believe it is possible that we get this guy elected so hey I'll put a link in the

733
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:05,280
show notes to to all those things as well before I forget if you're looking for a fantastic

734
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,720
set of headphones you've probably heard the the spot in front of the daily source code it's

735
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,880
big recommendation from the network to check out the new Sony headphones it's Tony dot com slash

736
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,760
headphones they've got wireless headphones they've got noise reduction headphones and people

737
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,080
really seem to be liking them I'm getting a lot of calls about it so check that out for sure

738
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:34,480
and let's play this comment first hey Adam it's Kevin Crossman the proud scruncher from

739
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:42,000
pack podcast.com man with a bummer coming back into the country again I do appreciate you continuing

740
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,880
to keep this issue alive it's seriously fucked up just like you said I have a couple ideas

741
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,960
first of all obviously need to follow that paperwork and we want to know what's happening with that

742
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,480
maybe we need to you know credit new domain name free Adam Curry dot com yeah now you're talking

743
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,120
I'll perhaps have a new tagline podcasting is not a crime or how about don't send me to get

744
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:11,520
mo don't send Adam to get mo dot com and of course if you are gonna register a domain like that I

745
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:18,800
highly recommend you use my promo code dsc3 and you'll get that domain for $6.95

746
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,280
all right one more comment before we roll out the last song for this food bar Friday

747
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:31,120
hey Adam this is Dave and Colorado this is in regards to bringing back control of the masses

748
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,320
I think that's a real good idea a couple months ago my wife was talking to me and

749
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,920
sure before you continue let me just remind everybody this is basically the idea of slowing down

750
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,360
the most powerful force in the American economy which of course is us the consumers just by slowing

751
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,520
it down and letting the government know that we're slowing it down because we are actually in control

752
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,400
and we will keep control and it's not that hard it doesn't mean you have to stop buying stuff all

753
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:06,160
together maybe if you stop buying 90% of stuff stuff that you probably don't need anyway so okay

754
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,200
so you and your wife were talking about what happened if we didn't do or if we didn't buy Christmas

755
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:17,760
oh man and that's hard it was kind of thinking I don't know how good that would go over with the kids

756
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:24,880
so we decided to do it and we brought it up to the kids and say we're all for it you know

757
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,680
they have everything that they need or they don't have everything they want but everything that

758
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,960
they need and that's really good man shit I don't have everything that I want

759
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,320
not by a long shot and if you have everything you want and there's nothing left to wish for

760
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:47,440
and of course I have more than anything I need so that's a good good point right there not

761
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,440
and wow big up to you my friend for talking to your kids about that

762
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,680
we're talking about the kids not having medical care or food in other parts of the world so

763
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,920
we're going to take all the money that we spend on Christmas not only for our kids and our family

764
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,520
members but all our guests together and we're going to help build a church in India

765
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:17,440
there's other places that you can spend your money you can do like half our international

766
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:25,040
which is farm animals for family in Africa you can drill wells for people who don't have

767
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:32,240
clean drinking water or so on and I was just thinking that you can stick it to the man and

768
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:38,960
you can help out your community whether it be here by where you live in the same country or around

769
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:51,040
the world and my kids are all for it and I just think it's a good idea we can stick it to the

770
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:56,240
man and say you know we're not going to fight your stuff and in a matter of fact we're going to

771
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:03,520
help out our brothers and sisters throughout the world and that's all I was thinking but anyways with

772
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:10,320
all with all love and respect go fuck yourself out now thank you you know as you were talking

773
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:17,280
there I was thinking of myself okay so it's clearly possible and it seems like we're all willing

774
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:23,040
to participate in slowing down our spending for a number of good reasons or at least not spending

775
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,240
them on stuff that we don't need so spending it on like you just said you know helping out

776
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:34,160
your local community or or other countries that's fine too just to make it easy I'd say let's

777
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,880
work on the United States for the time being but it doesn't work it's you know all you get then

778
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,880
if we if we really are successful at propagating that idea all you really get is that you know consumer

779
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,440
spending will go down and that will be bad for the economy or that's a bad indicator for the

780
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,240
of the American economy and of course if no one knows why that's happening then we fail so we need

781
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,880
some kind of you know some kind of campaign and as you were talking I was saying why don't we

782
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,520
write a declaration of independence a declaration of independence from the United States government

783
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:14,720
and instead of saying we the people we would start off with we the consumers and then we could

784
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,320
essentially because that's where the declaration of independence was it was a letter to King George

785
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:26,480
of England saying we the people over here in the new land you know we're distancing ourselves

786
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,680
from you so now we don't of course you know we can never distance ourselves from our own government

787
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,160
but we can send a very strong message equally as strong as the declaration of independence

788
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,080
and starting off by we the consumers would anyone mind taking a stab at that you know go look

789
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:48,320
at the existing declaration of independence the existing one you know that one and let's do a modern

790
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:57,840
day version of it trans trans mortified if you modified if you will to this campaign that we the

791
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:03,040
consumers of the United States of America have decided that we need to separate ourselves from the

792
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:08,480
way you are running the economy something like that I'm a little too fine to think about it right now

793
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:18,000
but please think about that register domain name for that it this could be a pretty good idea

794
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,960
I have so many ideas just not enough hours in the day to actually execute and thanks to Jersey

795
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,560
Todd for sending me this track man Alice Smith she's on the pod save music network she's beautiful

796
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:38,640
inside and out this is woodstock not works safe which makes me like even more

797
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,800
really stop dreaming I just let it slip away thinking about all the bills I've got to pay

798
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:03,520
I think I have my Trinity my back on with a date 10 days and it won't stop taking anything

799
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:12,080
so please excuse me because I'm feeling quite dead and imagine it was 10 days and it won't stop

800
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:20,480
taking anything fill them out like a cello going in and what the season say how stupid it's

801
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,760
for me

802
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:33,360
why man what a sunny day I can't wait to get out and play walk down those city streets

803
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:40,960
laughing at our old city creeps say I got a lot to organize I have a lot of thinking to do

804
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:46,320
another day is gonna be out another day is how it will be

805
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:52,320
10 days and it won't stop taking anything so what the season skills me

806
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,840
because I'm feeling quite dead and imagine it was 10 days and it won't stop taking anything

807
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:07,520
fill them out like a cello going in and what the season say how stupid it's for me

808
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,800
is that

809
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,960
It's been 10 days and it's time to take it any day

810
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,960
So what do you think this gives me?

811
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,960
Because I'm feeling quite sad and I'm happy again

812
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,960
It's been 10 days and it's time to take it any day

813
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,960
I'm feeling a little like a cello

814
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,960
Go in and pull out the sleeves

815
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,960
Just say how it's gonna fit this

816
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,960
It's been 10 days and it's time to take it any day

817
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:24,960
I'm feeling a little like a cello

818
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,960
Where's this girl being all my life?

819
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,960
How do I can that sound?

820
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,960
Alice Smith from the pod tape music network woodstock

821
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,960
She got another track of their called dreams

822
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,960
Nice!

823
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,120
Like the sound, it's like the vibe, it's a different, awesome.

824
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,920
I was just looking at the flight plan for the Ron Paul Blimp

825
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,920
in the Rally North Carolina, I guess, just about now.

826
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,640
Greensboro, later this afternoon, Charlotte,

827
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,920
and then landing at 6.30 at Chester Airport.

828
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,280
And then Saturday all day flying from Chester Airport

829
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,640
to Greensville, North Carolina to Columbia, South Carolina

830
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,760
back to Chester, and then, of course, the Tea Party of seven

831
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,880
in the Columbia area on Sunday.

832
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,400
And I guess we've got to get those guys more money.

833
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,720
This thing is cool.

834
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,400
It's a serious blimp, you know, with like, guys,

835
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,720
like pilots flying it.

836
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,040
You know, there's, you know, one of those little cabins

837
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,880
underneath.

838
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,080
This is a great, this should get some news.

839
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,960
This really should, let's pay attention.

840
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,320
I mean, there's no reason why it shouldn't get news.

841
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:30,000
And maybe now people will understand who Ron Paul is.

842
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,120
All right, my peeps, don't forget your last chance of dance

843
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,840
for this quarter for Ron Paul, Ron Paul 2008,

844
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,800
please donate money.

845
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,440
Let's get this guy elected.

846
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,360
Can't be much worse than we have right now.

847
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,440
And I endorse him, and, and I'm just a disc jocky.

848
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,200

And, of course, you can email me at him at podshow.com.

850
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,200
It looks like I'll be here all the next week.

851
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,000
Of course, I'll be in an out of the city,

852
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,600
doing crap just before the holiday is really kicking

853
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,120
to full gear.

854
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,440
