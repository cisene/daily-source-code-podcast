1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey Peter, can I ask you a question?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yes, do you?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Who would you say our calls important?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
After 20 minutes of being on hold, I'd have to say now.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Please continue to hold.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Your call is important to us.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, it's very correct.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's very important.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then we'll hold music.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Unif I turn the cations.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Or I'll buy Cisco.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now there's the DSC533 without Splenda.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Um, yeah.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, I hate it.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hate it.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I hate it.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Then there's the DSC533 with Splenda.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I love that show.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I love that show so much.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And not, yeah.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But of course, we all love the DSC533.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Food Bard.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Anyone can suck off my pipe anytime.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You never know what you're going to hear on the Charlie.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Kick up the music, AC.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm just kidding.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's a hat in the curry.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
One hit.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Three.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Got it.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Got it.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Got it.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Got it.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Got it.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Got it.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Got it.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Got it.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Get up.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Get up.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Get up.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Be beep, beep, beep.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Got it.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Got it.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Got it.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Got it.

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Got it.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Got it.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I like it.

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Been alive.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Come on, Patty, I'll post

Take all right in my, but we got nothing to hide

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,920
Friday Thursday night, but I'm getting so many messages that people really love in the fact

101
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:34,160
that the show is ready in the morning almost all over the world except for Australia.

102
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,520
We've already been through that. Oh man, I'm so ready. I got some great tunes. I did the show

103
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,640
prepletive the office today. I did that for the last couple of nights. It's kind of nice.

104
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,800
You know, around six o'clock and I plug in the speakers and you know, people come in and

105
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,880
out and we're just playing tracks and people are commenting. It's cool. Andrew Grumman was

106
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,200
hanging out with me at this evening. And once again, you guys have done it. You've put

107
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,520
together the entire show for me. I don't have to do anything. In fact, all I have to do is kind

108
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,520
of move it along because there's so much to talk about. A lot of good emails, too, which of course

109
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,760
have to do with free Trinity. And by the way, I want to thank Doug, the originator of free Trinity,

110
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,320
for reminding me about Stingray, one, four, three. Of course, that was mentioned in audio

111
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,200
comment earlier this week. And of course, Stingray, I've played them, they started the cowbell

112
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,360
revolution. They revived it for me. So I've got a couple of things to just run through

113
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,200
quickly. Stuff we've been talking about this week. Then we're going to get into, um, let's see,

114
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:39,760
the naming of the new abode. And of course, free Trinity. Yeah. So let's, uh, well, here's something

115
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:46,240
new fresh. Hey Adam, this is Jen from Bucket. Now part of the pod show family at BucketSouthBodShow.com.

116
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,480
Anyway, I was just calling you about reality TV shows. I heard you say this, you like American

117
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,320
Idol. I know it's not about the singing and all that, but kind of feel that you're my people now

118
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,040
because I love, I love that. Anyway. So I know you're in a big brother. So I just saw it that I would

119
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,000
tell you that there's this show being talked about. I think it's coming out of the Netherlands,

120
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,160
actually. It's another reality TV show. Um, it's a reality dating show for visibly

121
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,920
district-figured people. So the idea of the show is that people who have visible handicaps,

122
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,720
it's going to be a dating show for them. I just, um, I just had the call you and tell you,

123
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm going to, I haven't said to the link when I get to my computer. I'm in the car right now.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,600
But um, you just, you have to look at this. I, I love to hear you talk about it. Anyway,

125
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,040
take care and I'll talk to you later. Hi. Not Jen. Thank you so much. So nice. Yeah. Isn't

126
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,160
a nice to be part of the family? Have I initiated you yet? I don't think so. Richard Brueher

127
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,760
will be calling you about that. Yeah. So let me, uh, yes, it is indeed a, uh, a show that's

128
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,440
being produced in the Netherlands. I've read about this too. I haven't actually heard about it

129
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,240
from any of my Dutch contacts. You know, we're on very different time zones. But I'm sure I'll

130
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:01,840
hear more about it. Um, two things about that. One, the Netherlands is extremely open about,

131
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:10,640
particularly visual handicaps. And I remember this, when we moved to the Netherlands in 1972,

132
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,560
I was a wee, a wee young boy, come on up on Grandpa's knee. I'll tell you a story, okay?

133
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,800
I we, uh, we moved there. And I remember there's a couple of things that really stood out about

134
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,720
the Dutch. Uh, the first one was they ate French fries with mayonnaise.

135
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,320
And that was pretty freaking weird. Something else that we noticed over the course of the

136
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,440
first couple of years and of living in the Netherlands, the Dutch have their wind their curtains

137
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,840
always to open push to sides. You can look into their window. Their windows are always

138
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,040
impeccably clean. I'm generalizing, of course. But that, that pretty much was the culture in

139
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,440
1972 to 75. So I'm sure some of that has lasted throughout the years.

140
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,520
And they love for people to look in and their window sills. There's always nice things displayed

141
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,600
and it's part of the culture. And we also noticed that there was no, and I, and I really recall

142
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,600
my parents talking about this. Uh, the Dutch don't hide their handicap the way other cultures do.

143
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,560
And I think probably, I think probably then, uh, we realized that, wow, the Dutch are

144
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,760
very more open or at least we see a lot more severely handicapped people. You know, just like

145
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,000
disturbingly so if you're, particularly if you're a kid, now that that was in 72. So hopefully

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,160
kids don't witness it that way anymore. That's kind of hard for me to judge. But I think the

147
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,880
Dutch really mean this. It's part of their DNA. It is part of their, of their, their cultural

148
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,200
to display this. And they're not going to be making fun of it. That's the piece that I believe

149
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,640
is being misunderstood. You know, it's like, hey, let's, let's give the, the lowest, the lowest,

150
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,960
uh, hmm, what am I looking for? The Dutch liked losers, complete losers in life to win.

151
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,040
And lots of cultures like that. You know, but this is more than the underdog. I think it's a very,

152
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,680
you know, that they truly mean it. Like, yeah, let's, let's have them hook up with a date. That's

153
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,600
pretty fucking cool. It's not going to be to be to make laughing stock out of them.

154
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,320
Now the other thing I wanted to say about that is we've been talking a lot about reality shows in

155
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,040
the past week. You know, I, I subscribed to a couple of RSS feeds, it's like motivational quotes of

156
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,880
the day and quote of the day. And I, and I always read all kinds of interesting quotes. And I'm always

157
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,880
thinking, well, I wish I could come up with a great quote that would live on forever. And I think

158
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,200
I have one. I think I've got one. And it relates to what we've been talking about

159
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:43,040
in the past week about reality shows and about the racism, a legit racism being portrayed in big

160
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,440
brother, celebrity, big brother in the UK and all this back and forth. And I was kind of

161
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,440
realizing that, you know, it's who we are. These are reality shows. The whole point is to show

162
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,480
you reality. And, and usually, and I'm just repeating myself, usually when people see themselves,

163
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,040
when they recognize themselves, they pretty much hate it. People who really hate reality shows,

164
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,240
I think they're probably seeing some of them, of themselves in those shows. So here was the quote.

165
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,960
I hope makes it into the history books as it be nice. No, Adam Curry. Reality is pornographic.

166
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,920
And that come on. That's a pretty cool quote, isn't it?

167
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,360
Adam, it shows in London. Nice talk. You haven't spoken to it at all?

168
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Hey Charles, Charles, our drunken lunderer. Ah. Hammered again, Charles?

169
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,280
Is now Thursday, about 9.30 in the morning. God damn, I just got off the tube.

170
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,200
Apparently, he's had the tube in his vein now.

171
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,800
Now, wine, the tube winds up everybody. But, uh, not me. I keep kind of zen.

172
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,120
Oh, okay. It's not that kind of tube I get. I try to be a nice passenger,

173
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,800
but someone in just gets juice. And the fact that they put the prices up this new year,

174
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,040
George Dan, 27 pound 50 for a weekly 1-3 don't card.

175
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,920
Holy crap, that is a lot of money. What was that? It's quite some of this, uh, like 58 bucks a week,

176
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,680
just for a 1-3 zone card. I mean, can you even,

177
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:21,280
how far do you can even get that far with a 3-zone or can you? Yeah, that is very expensive, Charles.

178
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:28,480
My, George. Anyway, that's a little winch there. It's so weird how you seem to have

179
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:40,560
women call you in again. Hi, my name is Janet. I'm sexy. My, George, what a awful, awful radio voice.

180
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,680
Yeah, I want more of that. I want more women calling in talking really sexy. Shut up, Charles.

181
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,240
Please podcast. I can't even anything worse to listen to a middle-aged woman tell me about her

182
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:59,760
bit. It's been for yourself, Charles. Anyway, okay, first of all, you know, probably fourth point

183
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,880
by now. Sorry, family. Um, all right, racism. Regardless of whatever you think about the situation,

184
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,920
it's, I think, I agree with you, Jennifer should be applauded. This is, uh, opening up a bag of

185
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:22,560
worms, the cannerworms and no one talks about the institutionalized racism in the UK. It's always just

186
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,880
sort of accepted. If you're not around someone who's black or in the, you know, Asian or

187
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,160
of any sort of color or creed, that isn't political occasion. If you're not in the presence of

188
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:42,400
those people, it seems to be okay for whitey, just sort of mock. And, um, only, it's a very,

189
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,960
very, very few people have either come across to do this. But, you know, what, where does it,

190
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,000
if I ever met one percent of people that are done, that means that that's one percent of the

191
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,040
country that they're about. And, you know, if I was to do my own stroke, you know, I think every

192
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,200
culture, everybody marks some other way of speaking. It's just the way people talk and sometimes

193
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,360
it's funny, come on, lighten up already. Uh, you think that's not happening. And, but, you know,

194
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,960
look, I'm not insulted that people make fun of my accent and, you know, people do the same thing

195
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,200
with Madonna, by the way. Uh, you know, that is, if you're going to call, what's happening,

196
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,560
what happened to Shopa or it's happening to Shopa Shetty. If they're going to call that racism,

197
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,640
they can call it, it call everything racism, lighten the fuck up. It's realized that we're

198
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,840
doing it and looking how stupid it is. And then maybe next time, maybe next time, you see someone

199
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,560
like a Jade Goodie doing that, you know, like, damn, man, I don't want to be that person. I'm just

200
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,480
not going to do it. I think that's the point. And I think that's why Charles is agreeing with me,

201
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,760
the channel 4 and the mulch will be applauded when you see more of this stuff. Show it.

202
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,120
I don't, I truly do not believe it will be an example and people will start doing that, too.

203
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
I think it's just so embarrassing when you see it and it's not acted when it's real.

204
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,640
Reality is pornographic. So I'm in full full agreement. This shit makes me stand out, bullshit.

205
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,200
And I don't want to be judged for any reason, let alone my color. And I have actually been

206
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:26,240
the victim of racism despite being a blonde head blue-eyed. What do you remember?

207
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,000
Who's called a corn said? I don't know. I'm not as English as they come, of course, not because

208
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,760
being English makes us all hybrid just pretty much every European and international country.

209
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,480
In fact, there was a program on recently how English are you and people are saying that that's

210
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,000
people are talking about how they think they're English. And when they were actually

211
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,920
their genes were researched, it turned out they're far from it. Anyway, my other point was Trinity.

212
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,240
Where could you talk about it? I wanted to drive from San Francisco. I'm going to drive from San Francisco

213
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,560
down through like all of your nice, uh, difficult, high weight that 101 I think. I'm not sure.

214
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,120
Right. So then it cut off. You know, it has like, you can only talk for three minutes, Charles.

215
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:23,520
Okay. I should be enough, dude. So it feels like I've touched some kind of nerve, not like

216
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:29,520
a sensitive nerve, but I like it in the way Charles is explaining that. Is it for all I know?

217
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,080
Indian people could be making fun of Pakistani people's accents. I'm sure it happens, you know?

218
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:42,960
So look and learn. And by the way, when I say reality is pornographic, that really stems

219
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:52,480
from the thought that pornography, you know, people having sex. And, uh, I guess viewing that

220
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,560
pre-recorded or in pictures or whatever, that's pornographic. Well, isn't it just reality?

221
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,120
What we're seeing? Doesn't everyone hope they're having sex like a porn star?

222
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,240
I sure do. Hey, Adam. This is Chris Daley from the Pod Music Countdown. And I just got

223
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,680
done listening to this on the DSC. I know. It's something about, uh, well, you know, it's the

224
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:25,040
whole candle and night time vibe. Mains urban out or something like that. At least it's pod safe.

225
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:32,560
If not, unpronounceable. I want to be with Angelina Jolie. I want to be a word that touches

226
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,400
her lips and music divine that sounds in her mind.

227
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,640
What the hell was that? Come on, Adam. Here, I have a saying for you. Repeat after me. Friends,

228
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,760
don't let friends pick out music when they're stone. Wow, that song was terrible. It reminds

229
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,520
me of another friend of mine who every time he gets wasted, he breaks out the Ronnie James D.O.

230
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,080
albums over and over and over. That's all he plays. Bad idea. Adam, the next time you're stone

231
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,800
and you need some music for your show, do the right thing. Pick up the phone, give me a call,

232
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,080
I'll steer you in the right direction. And hey, if I'm not available, there's always the official

233
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,760
musicologist, Jersey Todd. Keep it real, Adam. All right. How about this one, then?

234
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,280
Questions of the daily source code are explicit in nature and not meant for sensitive ears.

235
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,080
And then you fight me.

236
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,520
I kind of like this life that spits me. I want to feed that hand that fights me.

237
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:35,360
I want to fuck you when you fight me. You want to fuck with this mask.

238
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:09,120
You want to fuck with this mask a kiss. You're in over your head, you're in over your head.

239
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,560
Show me what you got. I get here a worthy competitor. You want to fuck me. You want to fight me.

240
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:26,720
I want to fuck you when you fight me. I kind of like the boy that's fight me.

241
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:51,920
I like to feed the hand that fights me. I like it when it hurts.

242
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:04,880
Show me what you're worth. Show me. I'll feed this shit out of you.

243
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,160
Yeah. I want you to know that Andrew's ramen and I we talked it over.

244
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,160
So yeah, only because it's a good one, you know, I'll be doing it out of you.

245
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,440
I like it when it hurts. Disturbing.

246
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,200
That is so disturbing. It really, really is. Rachel can K-A-N-N fight me.

247
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,600
That's been to my playlist for probably two months. I've been looking at that song saying,

248
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:52,640
I don't know. I just don't know. Anyway. So I've been looking for a new name for

249
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,040
our new house because we had the curry cottage. Didn't really feel right to call the new

250
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,920
place the curry cottage as well. And I've received a lot of suggestions. Unfortunately,

251
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,160
most of them buy an email, which kind of sucks because, you know, I don't mind reading a couple out,

252
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,960
but it would take a whole lot of time to, you know, to really sort through them so I wouldn't

253
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,360
do a whole bunch of doubles. Let me just give you a couple. With this from John Glasscock.

254
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:25,360
Curry Kasa Curry Shelle Curry Ossedy Curry Favor Curry Crash Pad Curry Krakow's things.

255
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:33,840
Curry Curry Cave Curry Comerancy, which is a short-term dwelling, Curry Cabin.

256
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,560
Nothing really hits me there. A couple others. I added a mixture in from London just to get

257
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:49,040
back to the naming of the new curry residents in Gilford. Just a fool, but if you compare to drop

258
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,400
me a letteration, I'd pass it to an Indian restaurant the other day with his name on it and

259
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,680
thought my pursuit was called the Curry Villa. How does that sound? Curry Villa, I think that's pretty good.

260
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,640
You know, I take air, see you soon, bye. Yeah, it sounds like an Indian restaurant, you know?

261
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,240
Exactly what it was intended for. No, that doesn't sound right.

262
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,240
Yeah, I don't, I'd like the obliteration bed. I'd like the cook.

263
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,400
Of course, there's also a cook pit pit pit pit.

264
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Hi, I'm David calling from Sunny Perth, West and Australia, but I think I'm just listening to

265
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,360
episode five to nine. It'd be one of you guys, sorry about that. You're talking about name

266
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:41,280
the new abode in England. Oh, I had a bit of a brain storm. Come up with the

267
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:47,760
pack, Palace, that's P.A.C. Patricia, Adam, Christina, the pack, Palace. How do they grab you?

268
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,000
Anyway, I'd rather all do well, love the show, keep listening. And I hope by now you've got

269
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,240
that bloody internet sort of had in the in the conduct. I'll keep listening and I'll hear from you soon

270
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,880
and I'll put you in my pack, Palace. Yeah, it sounds like a bad arcade game, you know?

271
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,880
I appreciate it though because that does kind of bring in, you know, the Trisha Adam Christina. That's

272
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,880
kind of cool. It was one that I liked. Let me see if I can find it. Who was this from?

273
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,840
Is this from Dave Pond Rios? Pond Rios? Hi, Adam. I figured with the connectivity

274
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,200
fun you're having at the moment. It would be better to shoot you an email rather than a voice mail.

275
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,000
Oh, well, yeah, I guess that's kind of right. When did you send this January 20th?

276
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,680
If you're still out for suggestions to Navy new place, how about Adam's Adam's attic? Adam's

277
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:50,240
attic. That kind of has a ring to it and he also suggested the curry crib. I think those two

278
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,240
names are kind of working for me. Love the show, keep of the great work. I think we'll stop with

279
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,960
Metro sexual moments. Yeah. Yeah, I think we kind of were kind of over that. But he's a quick one.

280
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,080
Check out the boss skin product line from Hugo Boss. While it may not be quite cheap enough for

281
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,760
daily use, it's great for a little pamper now and then that us guys so deserve. Plus, the ladies love

282
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:21,040
the subtle scent of it. Dave. Dave Pond Rios. Deep pan, he says. Okay. Yeah, man. Adam's attic. I don't know

283
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,080
the kind of my work. That does have a vibe to it for sure. Oh, well, let me let me let me just

284
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,840
live with it for the weekend in the trip home and I'll tell you on Monday when I think about it.

285
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,680
Okay, put your hands up if you go to movies. We go to a lot of movies. This is Robert and Toronto.

290
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,880
Hey, Adam, this is Doug Pilgrim. Oops, that's the wrong one. Oh, man.

291
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:19,120
Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry about that. Oh, yeah. How could I have messed that up? I thought I had it.

292
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,880
Oh, I hate myself when I messed it up like that. I was ready to get into the segment. You know,

293
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,280
we got the theme songs, so I might as well queue it up and intro properly. It's time to talk about everyone's

294
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:38,880
darling driving across the USA. I'm hoping to make a good time today. I'm feeling

295
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,440
I've been watching you go letting everybody know that this is going to be the better way.

296
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:55,120
Trinity, Trinity, the quintessential luxury, Trinity, Trinity left the bio diesel set

297
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:03,280
you're really, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity. Free Trinity save the world, win valuable prizes.

298
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:12,000
Trinity. We are attempting to figure out how to gain some attention for the bio diesel movement

299
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,120
because it's not an industry. It's a movement. What did I see? Did I see an actress last night on

300
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:25,120
Letterman? I think talking about the fact that she drove on bio diesel in her, in her, I didn't,

301
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,760
I just kind of caught the last the tail end of the interview. I think that she was on Letterman.

302
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,280
And she was talking about putting bio diesel in and that she was really sold on the fact that it's

303
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:39,920
smelled like a Korean restaurant, something like that. I don't know how she could tell. It was a Korean

304
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,960
restaurant. But, you know, it's, it's bio diesel. It's kind of getting some attention. You know,

305
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,160
people are talking about it in all walks of life. Hey Adam, it's Chef Mark here with Jennifer.

306
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,560
We've been following the free Trinity thread with great interest and wouldn't you know,

307
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,800
while enjoying chukru at the famous lay-all restaurant in New York City last night,

308
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,600
we found a great source of fuel for Trinity. Yes, we actually got to speak with

309
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,440
Philippe Lajoni, the owner of Lail, and I asked him about their recycling of cooking oil

310
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,360
from the stick fleet in the kitchen to pair bio diesel gals like our beloved Trinity.

311
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,440
So very simply, this company comes to the restaurant once a week. They collect all our oil

312
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,400
from our fires and they clean it up, they filter it, and then they use it for cars and

313
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:35,600
trucks that are diesel and they can run on oil. In fact, when I opened Lail in Tokyo,

314
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:42,880
in Japan in a few years ago, I had met a person who owned over a hundred Kentucky Fried Chicken.

315
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:53,120
So he was turning over a lot of oil. That's right, and he was doing a lot of

316
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,920
deliverings and pickups, and the entire fleet of vehicles was running on his own oil.

317
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:06,160
And he would not spend a dime on the oil yet on gas. That works all of the trans fat

318
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,360
problem in New York too. Yeah, that is great. So that's awesome.

319
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,800
That is like a furniture even doing it now. Yes, the oil, the clitorious.

320
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:27,520
I'm going to be funny if you just said that. I don't mean can you save the world and when

321
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,760
valuable prizes, you can also feed your car biodiesel from one of the top restaurants in the land.

322
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,360
Listen for the full interview on an upcoming food philosophy podcast.

323
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,400
And Mark will also have more audio from the Chukut Hall of Fame dinner on Remarkable Palette.

324
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,440
Be sure to include New York City on that free turnity tour at him because we can feed

325
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,400
her some top shelf biodiesel. But we're saving the Chukut and stick it for ourselves.

326
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,240
Ah, mercy, Jennifer.

327
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:06,320
I wonder if you put, uh, I guess depending on whatever was cooked in the oil, it may indeed smell

328
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,000
different. We should do some of these experiments. So, oh, man, let me, a lot of this came through

329
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,080
email, of course. So it just takes me a little bit longer to get through everything. But

330
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,520
I got a lot of these from Thomas Crosslon who writes at him a couple of things. How about having

331
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,720
Trinity stop to attend potsafe music gigs along the way? Although you just tuning into the

332
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,760
into the conversation about free Trinity, we're trying to figure out what to do here.

333
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,560
Doug Pilgrim was kind enough to offer to fly out with this son to San Francisco,

334
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:46,080
drive the car back, do a podcast every day during a week. And this is really sparked a lot of

335
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,360
response. And people, a lot of people would like to help along the way, a lot of people have a small

336
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,480
biodiesel based businesses that they'd like to promote, which I haven't all for, you know,

337
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,720
as long as we can document it, as long as we can, you know, actually create something. And I'm talking

338
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,360
small size things, you know, maybe three to five minutes, nothing too long. And, you know, the idea

339
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:18,320
of having, excuse me, I really didn't want to burp out loud. I wouldn't do that. That was a really

340
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:26,400
disgusting line. Okay, either stop to meet a podcast or attend a potsafe music artist concert.

341
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,800
And here's a map of biodiesel stations across the U.S. are already, you know, we've got mapping

342
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:36,160
information here. And these guys may be able that might be able to help you pin Trinity,

343
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,600
where does that love craft biofuels? Hold on, I haven't actually clicked on that link yet.

344
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:47,760
Let me see, what does it look like? Oh, they pimp, they pimp out. Oh, nice. Oh, man, the community of

345
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,240
people who are into biofuels is so incredibly fun. They just look like a bunch of fun. And they're

346
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,280
not all tree huggers, you know, it's just fun people who are just doing some amazing stuff. Okay,

347
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:09,600
so here's Doug. And thank you, Doug, so as I said, Doug Pilgrim reminded me that stingray, I've

348
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,320
actually paid a plate of a couple times. And he says, hey, Adam, how are you good evening? Here's the

349
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,360
here's the URL for the hemp car you showed interest in. Yeah, thank you. Second, passing Trinity

350
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,000
from podcast to podcast or sounds like a very cool idea promoting alternative energy, alternative

351
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,720
content, alternative independent music all at once. Wow, independent media about that, huh?

352
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:37,120
Independent media, independent oil, fuck, sounds good. It reminds me of the little white

353
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,360
bike project that was attempted in Amsterdam in the 60s before your time. Not actually the white

354
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,840
bikes, I think we're still around. They were just just about all the last of them. We're still

355
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,520
in Amsterdam when we got there in the very early 70s. Check with the suits first before you go forward

356
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,320
liability issues with all those non-employee drivers. Oh, yeah, luckily we got a suit, Brian.

357
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,720
These, he's been out sick for a couple. You know, a lot of people have been out sick.

358
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,960
It's like a flu bug going around, but it seems like two different versions of it. I think I've been

359
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,440
very lucky. I see people get really stuffed up, sniffly, start sneezing. Maybe that's what I had

360
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,720
the last time I don't know. And some people get a really, really hard, bad stomach virus, bad stomach

361
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:32,240
flu, moody. What is moody? Moody is SVP of production and programming. His daughter, like

362
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:39,520
for five days, is at high fever and severe stomach cramping and stuff. Yeah, it's crap, man.

363
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,600
It literally, it's crap. And yeah, you come home, you flip on the television. There's all these

364
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,920
commercials for like, what does this cold medicine bring down that high fever fast for kids?

365
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,920
Are these people shooting shit into the air? Or something that they know?

366
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,640
You know, they're media buys. They're pretty fucking on the money, aren't they?

367
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,480
Ah, third, how about going to podcasts or houses? I'm back to the Doug Pilgrim's email. Go from

368
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,480
city to city across country. Each night, going to a different club where a pod sick musician would play

369
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,800
a gig and all your listeners from an area could come together. Damn. Trinity could be parked

370
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,600
outside. Swag could be given away. Live music from the show could be played on the podcast the next

371
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,560
day with videos sound and interviews from the show are kind of rolling pod fest 2007, 10 days,

372
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:28,320
10 cities, 10 concerts, one big promotional bang all ending in say New York with brother love playing

373
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,880
CC Chapman, Jersey Todd as the MCs. If you dig this, you would like me to propose this as an

374
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,120
audio. Oh shit, man. Of course, you got to send this in his audio. Don't make me read this.

375
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,280
Well, Doug, first of all, I really appreciate the fact that you're willing to explore. You

376
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,440
had a damn cool idea to start with and it's really grown into something else. And so I appreciate

377
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,640
you being open to, you know, you're not being all pissed off about the fact that we're taking

378
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:03,200
your idea and morphing it into something else. That's cool. Paul Savi, Adam, I work with a company,

379
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:10,080
skyships. We make vehicle tracking devices that you glue onto the roof of a vehicle. The

380
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,720
device is completely self-contained, solar powered, no wiring or battery required and contains

381
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,440
a GPS and GSM mobile module, which period of who transmits the vehicle location by SMS text.

382
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,720
Small company based in town. What is it? Chowmsford? Chowmsford, I guess, in the UK,

383
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,640
whose main business is remote controlled airships. What is it? Skyships.co.uk. Paul, very interesting.

384
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,720
That's exactly the type of thing I'm looking for. I think I'm looking for something a little bit

385
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:48,000
more advanced and not necessarily, although SMS is, of course, freaking bulletproof, isn't it?

386
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,000
You know, I'm trying to get Nokia into the game here. Maybe they could trick out one of their

387
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,760
camera phones. So it could send multimedia messages and me look. Come on, someone's going to be

388
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,040
able to put this together. The guys who've got the box are Nokia, but we're going to charge them,

389
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:15,120
obviously. Otherwise, yeah, I'd like to promote skyships. Let's see, there were a couple more

390
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,800
audio things. Let's see, what else do we have here? Hey Adam, this is Dawn, just a listener from

391
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,480
San Francisco Bay Area. About the free Trinity thing, you know, instead of a strapping app,

392
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:34,400
I might want to try Google Earth. I'm much more interactive. I know there's people who've

393
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,480
done overlays and stuff on it. Let's check that out. Yeah, you know, right,

394
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,640
our man, how silly of me, of course. I do like the fact that we can show an image as well,

395
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,920
so we can get an image from Google Earth into a web page, and that's cool too. But yeah,

396
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,560
absolutely, because that'll give the mainstream media something to some graphics. They can,

397
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,160
yeah, they can, they love doing that. I see that all the time now in television. They zoom in

398
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,160
somewhere and you can see it's, it's usually it says Google Earth right there in the corner of the

399
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:12,000
screen. So, you know, we'll be able to give them actual rolling video of the path that Trinity is

400
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,360
taking. And by the way, why limit this only to the U.S. of A? Hey Adam, it's all in here. I'm driving

401
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:26,800
in just near the egg in the traffic jam, and I was listening to your, uh, the source code by Trinity.

402
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,560
I think it's a fantastic idea to bring it from one coast to the other. But why don't you put

403
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,680
it into a global initiative? And, uh, Shiverdale would have Europe as well. You can hand out

404
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,680
it with a car from Port Gostom to Port Gostom. We all think it's for this thing, rather than the

405
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,360
bonding between two people, what you do, bonding between hundreds of people, make it around the

406
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,720
room with any space. Why not? Good luck. Right on. Okay, that's the kind of stuff I'm talking about.

407
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,520
I'm sure we can find someone with a, with a container and we can stop, you know, just push

408
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,640
right into a container and then, uh, retrieve it on the other end. Absolutely. I know we can do this.

409
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,000
So, here's what I think we got to start organizing. We've got to start organizing a number of

410
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,400
stops starting in San Francisco, and we want to take it all the way to, uh, I guess you're good in New York,

411
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,040
and then we go New York to Boston. We could ship it out from Boston. That'd be kind of a nice

412
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,240
sendoff. We've got a lot of people in the Boston area. And along the way, we, we, so we need bio fuel,

413
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,680
and so we need, or, you know, and also people doing interesting things with, just bio

414
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:45,280
crap, let's just do the, it's Trinity, free Trinity poop tour. Um, so we need that, um, we want to,

415
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,160
this is a, this is a, this is a pretty big project. I'm game for, if we're organizing

416
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,240
it, if we can really get some people who are motivated enough to work on this, I think it's,

417
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,320
it's primarily tools, you know, if, if we can track this, so that's why I said frapper map,

418
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,600
just because it's easy to do. You can probably import something from frapper into, uh, into Google

419
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,640
Earth anyway. Let's just set up a frapper map, so we can start putting, you know, start mapping out a route,

420
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,960
a more or less logical route, and it doesn't have to be straight across the US. We can go up and

421
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,240
down, let's know, problems, visit a couple of states while we're on what we're doing it anyway.

422
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:23,440
And so, as I was working through all that, I get this email, now I really got excited.

423
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,640
This is from, uh, Michael. Adam, I really like the father, Sonny wants the podcast

424
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,240
from driving across the US. The concept reminds me of another amazing accomplishment that

425
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:40,000
started with telling a story about a journey. I'm a cyclist. I've written across Iowa on

426
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Ragbry, which is an acronym, and it's a massive crossstate bicycle race across Iowa that is well-known

427
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,920
throughout the US and the world. The R-A-G-B-R-A-I, Ragbry, is an acronym for Registers Annual Great

428
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:01,680
Bicycle Ride Across Iowa. Does any points to a Wikipedia article about it? I started in 1973

429
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,600
when a register columnist wrote that he was going to ride across Iowa with a friend. He did,

430
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,400
and he wrote about it daily for a week. During the ride, his readers love the story so much

431
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,800
that they did the ride the following year and invited anyone to join. The ride went from a few

432
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,000
to a few hundred. In a few years, it grew to over 10,000 and attracted riders from every state in the

433
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,640
US and many from around the world. Okay, so that's basically his setup. Here's his pitch.

434
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,000
How does this relate to Trinity? Well, how about if you give Trinity to the nice father, Son podcaster

435
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,440
and let him lead the first cross-country drive invite anyone with a bio-fuel vehicle to join

436
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,320
even if it's a short segment near where they live. And of course he's thinking, Michael says,

437
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,880
I think the media would jump on a cross-country trek of bio-fuel vehicles that provide heaps of

438
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,920
personal interest stories with blogs, audio, video, participant interviews, background stories,

439
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,120
what also advocating the use of bio-fuel. So my humble suggestion is to apply your podcasting

440
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:06,800
in media ingenuity. No, I love that. In distorting the first podshow annual great bio-fuel drive

441
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,200
across America. Well, I think we can come up with something snappy other than that. Free Trinity.

442
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,680
Yeah, of course he says, you can find a better job at finding an acronym. Probably good luck.

443
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,000
Hope this can help promote the awareness and use of bio-fuel. Michael, I'm loving that idea.

444
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,440
And you know, when I'm hearing that, I like, yeah, man.

445
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,520
You know, I want to be there for at least a part of it. That's going to be a frickin' party.

446
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,840
So okay, so when you buy a few vehicles that stop off along

447
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,880
route that is tracked by a frapper map, and hopefully also tracked with some kind of mystical box

448
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,960
that brings us pictures and video and GPS positions, it's just cool if we can do that.

449
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:57,120
Come on, we're geeks. So when people, places to stop off at who can help us with bio-fuel,

450
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,440
have bio-fueled vehicle might want to ride along. And the evening, of course, we want to wind

451
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,960
up at a pod save music gig. So that, that'll take a map. We got to coordinate this so we can see if we

452
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:16,000
can really get people together. And then what else do we need? And enough, I think it's a good start.

453
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,080
Okay, we got the weekend to think about it in a lot of people are behind, but let's see if we can

454
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,720
get this together. And you know, whatever needs to be done, poncho is going to do it because

455
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:52,000
this is just too much fun.

456
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,880
Yo, what's up, AC? It's Jersey Todd, the official musicologist of the Chacha.

457
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,800
Yo, big man, this is why you absolutely need to keep me hanging around the source code.

458
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,200
Dude, I heard you playing Jeremy Roe yesterday. All right, that's fine. But this song in line

459
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,760
to die, that was put up this past summer. People don't come to a food bar Friday to hear the

460
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,240
same old stuff, they come to you the new stuff, the fresh stuff, the stuff that absolutely kicks

461
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,880
ass. Man, oh man, oh man, the people are just not going to stand for that. Let's see, I'm going

462
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,480
to need some help with this. Yo, Jeremy Roe, where are you out today? Dude, can you help me out with

463
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:29,680
this? Hey, Adam, this is Jeremy Roe. I'm just sitting here on a Fubar Friday, drinking a cup

464
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,880
of shitty raw sewage coffee, but you know what, it actually tastes pretty good because I've got

465
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,920
ten packets of splendour in it. Anyways, I just wanted you guys to hear my new single

466
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,160
in the shadows off of my new album, Where the Truth lies, which is up on the PMN,

467
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,080
Podsafe Music Network. So here it is, check it out.

468
00:44:46,160 --> 00:45:03,920

Take safely how it goes

472

Sometimes I'll own my country

473
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,920
That's it, take it, I will
