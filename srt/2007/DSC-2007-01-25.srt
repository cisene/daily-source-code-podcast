1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey Peter, can I ask you a question?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yes, do you?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Who would you say our calls important?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
After 20 minutes of being on hold, I'd have to say now.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Please continue to hold.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Your call is important, do I?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, it's very correct.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's very important.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then we'll hold music.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Unified communications.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Or by Cisco.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hello, Mr. Kerry.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is Ed Schwartz with the properties on as association in your building.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Mr. Kerry, I know you only hear once a month.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And so it's easy to get over the smells.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Like the French fries smell in the parking deck.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And the incense emanating from Yacondo.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We can put up with the noises.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
All hours of the day, something about as a sizing.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But if you wouldn't mind Mrs. Ebstein, down the hall,

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
is having some friends over for tea.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And she would like to know if you could remove your laptop

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and your router from the hallway.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She's afraid some of her friends might trip over it.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Thank you, Mr. Kerry.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We'll show you understand once you finish with the DSC 532.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You can remove your equipment.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Thank you.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Today is the next generation radio content in my ears.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is Delta Cia Charlie 532.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A podcast of Adam Kerry, the potpimp,

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
who gives job, money, and condoms to many potpards.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Isn't it carefully?

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
One day, the May-Begravity's hall too.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is Delta Cia Charlie 532.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000

This is Delta Cia Charlie 532.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is Delta Cia Charlie 532.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is Delta Cia Charlie 532.

Next are Delta Cia Charlie 534.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is Delta Cia Charlie 536.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's live on these because I know they'll be back

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
One eye open in case of attack

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If I make it through this, I'll never do it with this again

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And let's roll my new nail

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And let's bring my nail

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And let's roll my new nail

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And let's roll my new nail

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And let's roll my new nail

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And let's roll my new nail

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And let's roll my new nail

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And let's roll my new nail

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And let's roll my new nail

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And let's roll my new nail

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And let's roll my new nail

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And let's bring my new nail

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And let's roll my new nail

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I think you joined the hotseam music network in June of last year

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I think I've played this song but it showed up as a remastered version today

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, yesterday, like, oh man, he came back with a vengeance

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
God, that kicked so much ass

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Everybody, how are you doing?

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Daily source code episode 532

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Coming to you from Northern California, the Curry condo

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And I'd like to say right off the bat

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Whatever they're growing here in California, it is of excellent quality

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Much better than we're getting back home in old blighty

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I've had another, well, state a pretty late last night

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Because, of course, I've shifted my schedule

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm staying up, you know, doing the show

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Anyway, between 10 and 11 o'clock at night

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Getting up a little bit later, the normal, but still around 3 o'clock

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The jet lag just come with hits me like a ton of bricks

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And, um, at the day, of course, was no different

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I actually did wind up staying until, like, I don't know

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
7 o'clock or something like that

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But at the end of the day, I was so punchy

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I just had my, my Napster open

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And I was playing every single 80 song imaginable

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I hooked up some speakers

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And people who were in a meeting with me

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They could stay, you know, and talk more about whatever it was

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Only if they could guess the, you know, like a hit test

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If they could guess the, the artist and the song title

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Then they could stay and talk some more

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It just, I was tired

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So it came back tonight and, uh, wow man

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
American Idol, two hours special

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I just got done watching it, so what is it now?

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's about 10, 25

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I love that show

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I love that show so much

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And not, you know, not for the singing

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Because I really don't care

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sometimes, like, well, you know, there's someone who can really sing

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But it is just the, the emotions that are shown

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
On that television program are so beautiful

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Unfortunately, they're only of one variety

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, yeah, mostly there

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, that's not entirely true

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But it is either extremely sad or extremely happy

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And unlike any other reality type television format

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You know, they can do a lot of editing to make their story

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Which they obviously do

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But, you know, just to see someone

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can't act that, you know, that's real life

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And in fact, any actor who can act

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Like those people is a damn good actor

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Ah, it's just, it's beautiful to watch that

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And, you know, I've been thinking about reality shows a lot

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Because they've become so commonplace

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And, you know, there's so many different distinctions

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Really between, for instance, American chopper

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Tuddle, Paul Tuddle, senior, Paul Tuddle, junior

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's one type of reality show

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Big brother is a whole different type of reality show

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
American idol is yet another type

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But, but the, the point is

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The reality part of the show is there

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The things that are slipping through

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The things that we're seeing

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Are these intense moments of emotion

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
One way or the other, some type of emotion

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That we share because we understand exactly what that emotion is like

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We have been there

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Is that identification with ourselves that makes it so incredibly addictive

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And yet you hated it at the same time

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Because, of course, you hate a lot of the behavior that you're seeing

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because you recognize that in yourself

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And there's a lot of deep shit going on here

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So, this is a common point

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Because it's a very deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's a good point

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't even know what's really true

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's a very strong point

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, good on what it is

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's a very good situation

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's a very good situation

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's a very good situation

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's a very good situation

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's a very good situation

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's a very good situation

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's a very good situation

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's a very good situation

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's a very good situation

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's a very good situation

168
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's a very good situation

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's a very good situation

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's a very good situation

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So, it's a very good situation

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Whenever a person says

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If anyone wants to stay healthy, you need to understand

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
A lot of people, people else are excited

175
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I've heard that the people on stage will enjoy it

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Sometimes you don't have a consensus

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We can speak softly

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And outside there, the people are not afraid

179
00:09:46,000 --> 00:10:01,200
What news papers are you eating, your fish and chips out of? Come on. They've canceled

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,000
her perfume line. She's had to go on every single show and do every newspaper interview

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,440
she possibly could to pour it on to apologize. You know, she's totally being scapegoated

182
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,560
here. Because that's what's going on. I think that truly is what's happening. People are

183
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,520
recognizing a lot of what they're seeing in themselves and projecting that on to Jade Goodie.

184
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,480
And again, it's not just the UK. It happens everywhere. It happens in every culture. I think

185
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,680
we need to get over ourselves a little bit. Just a teeny bit. I come out. We can make fun of people's

186
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,640
accents. You know, and bullying it happens all the time. It's what humans do. Don't forget. You're

187
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:52,640
watching a reality show. Key word, root, real reality. This is the real life. And you know,

188
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,640
let's not go blame, uh, endable and channel four. Take a look at it. You know, don't forget. This is

189
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,480
not completely baked up entertainment. There is something real stuff going on here, which is

190
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,360
really, really human. Let's just not forget that. It's important. Study it. Learn. I find it, you know,

191
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,520
this. I love it. I'm a student of this shit. I love it so much. I'm jazzed in general today because

192
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,680
I've got so many responses to the free Trinity idea. We're going to get to that in a little bit.

193
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:33,760
I mean, just take the sky as anything else. I think she already did that. I think that,

194
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,760
now, first of all, you're probably right that she lost big brother. I was wrong. It doesn't matter.

195
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,720
If she comes out and people still know her several years later, she won big brother somehow.

196
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:51,840
She won something. I think people go into to win fame in general. But I think the

197
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,600
Indian trip, I think, I think that just added insult to injury because she had done that

198
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,960
previously. I think that's an old trip that you're talking to.

199
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,160
I'm so much tougher. I'm so random, I'll also be able to be racist because I can't

200
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,680
another girl on this trip so much together. I think it's kind of simple. I could be

201
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,760
correct. Problems, I think we're seeing that. I don't have any problems with what five

202
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,680
months before we've been playing, so we watched a lot of them. I think that's a lot more

203
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,680
slavery. You see.

204
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,880
Ah, come on. We all know Lesbians are sinister. They're sinister because they taunt me on all

205
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,360
these websites yet they never show up here at the door of the condo. That's sinister. That's evil.

206
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,200
Stop it. Leave well Lesbians. Don't do that.

207
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,120
Come on, Lesbians. It's a couple of times here. That's a nice little bit too.

208
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,600
It's all up to people's voices. It's a silly thing.

209
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,480
Well, exactly. Except when a comedian does it, it's funny because that's a quote

210
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,600
appropriate circumstance. We're geared up for it. We're keyed. We've been conditioned to

211
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,080
know, okay, this guy is about this and here's what it's going to say and we're ready for it

212
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,360
and we're going to just let our emotion go. We're going to rebound that in laughter.

213
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,040
Sure, but it's based on reality because real life is funny. It's great.

214
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,960
I Chris, thank you. He was so afraid. I wasn't going to get that comment to email

215
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:54,400
it to me five times today. Okay, so I would say that I'm all for it. Put it all on television.

216
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,200
I think things have to get just a little bit worse before they get better. It's okay, you know,

217
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,440
but let's just face it. This is the, in fact, I think it will reduce racism if if you show it

218
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,080
because everyone, when you when you hear or see racism or very inappropriate behavior or bullying

219
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,520
or whatever whatever it is, when you see that and it's a real life situation, it's shocking,

220
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,640
but it's shocking to everyone. There's not a single person who's going at that very moment

221
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,480
we see some shocking video. Believe me, there's no one in the world that looks that that

222
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,720
and goes, cool man. That was fucking awesome. That's not their immediate reaction. Maybe

223
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:41,840
after 30 seconds or after 30 hours. So it'll help us understand. We can't cover it up. It's real

224
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,160
life. It's called reality for a reason. My own reality is I miss my girls. I want to go home.

225
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,920
I can't wait for the new schedule to kick in. I stayed a little bit longer this time because I

226
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,320
didn't want to just leave midweek because I arrived midweek, but I want to try and stay a week

227
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,840
seven days. And it's been seven days. And it would be absolutely perfect to be on my way home right now

228
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:09,040
on a, you know, like a Saturday, arrive Sunday, hang out. And I talked to Patricia today and

229
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,280
everything's, you know, great. They're having a good time. And it's funny because, you know,

230
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:19,520
she's definitely, you know, well, she's, I think she's almost done with everything that she can

231
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,120
do at the moment with the house. So, you know, she's now, she's chilling out. So she doesn't have

232
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,120
a hell of a lot to say. And when I talk to her, you know, it's like, I've only slept while she was awake.

233
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,480
So I have nothing to say. I got completely nothing to say. So it's really hard, you know,

234
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,560
and we just, so we just talk a little bit of shit. Maybe you have 15 minutes a day.

235
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,000
And then I got this comment and I was like, oh, man, I really wish I was there.

236
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,960
Hey Adam, Kevin from Cambridge just letting you know that, uh, over here in old blighty,

237
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,200
we're getting snow coming down this morning, uh, since you're over there in San

238
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:04,000
Trent, you miss an hour. Wanted to let you and the DSC listeners know, it's beautiful.

239
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:14,240
So, talk to you later, folder out. You know, it just felt like, oh, man, finally got some snow,

240
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,880
but she was telling me about it. And I, it didn't really register until I heard this call,

241
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,640
and then I could really visualize what the new house must look like. And of course, I missed that.

242
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Although they say they might get snow again tomorrow, but I doubt this going to be, um,

243
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,120
I doubt that it's going to be snow when I get home on a Sunday.

244
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,720
I haven't flown for six or seven weeks, mainly due to weather, of course.

245
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,040
And by now, you know, with all the moving and everything, I haven't had sex in

246
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,800
the wild as well. It's getting desperate here at the condo, my friends. And then to know that

247
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,440
this is going on, meanwhile, back in Guilford, Roger Smalls is completely off as rocker

248
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,400
and he's organizing some kind of, you know, I'm just going to play his latest podcast. It's

249
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:04,080
only a couple of minutes, but this guy is unbelievable. You know, it's, so I've let's see

250
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,720
as be comic strip blogger, you know, yelling at me on email that, you know, I'm an asshole because

251
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,800
I won't do an interview with him in person. And you know, he doesn't want to interview me

252
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,560
in his, and he's angry and I'm, I'm a horrible person and I come on and then, and then this

253
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:24,640
from Roger Smalls. Hello everyone, Roger. Hey, yeah. I've got some announcement to make. I'll just

254
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,480
give you a brief history lesson first. Two years ago, European immigrant, Mr. Adam Kerry,

255
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,880
fled Belgium, and moved to England for tax reasons. He settled into a house in Guilford where

256
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,480
he spent many, a few years in what he calls the Kerry Cottage. So that doesn't think to find

257
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,560
work as a sister, the electricians, stripper, or bricklayer, like a lot of people from Europe.

258
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:54,000
Adam got a job as founder of the multinational podcasting company post-show and then

259
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
bought a car pad by two. Recently, however, Adam running some more tax problems and this time

260
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,200
with his car. So to keep one step ahead of the authority, he's been forced to change his address

261
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,760
yet again. So it's moved out, which means out of this weekend, the Kerry Cottage remains empty.

262
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,320
And I'm proud to announce the new business that I'll be launching along with my friend who's

263
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,920
an estate agent who was used to remain anonymous. Yeah, just a second here. I'd just like to say that

264
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,640
for those of you who may not know about Roger Smalls, I mean, I've never met this guy. He's gone through

265
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,440
my trash. He knows where I live. He lives in Guilford. I think he works for the NHS. That's the

266
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,560
National Healthcare Service in Britain. And please, don't take like what he's saying there about

267
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:51,680
why I moved. I just had a really frightening thought. I have to go for a physical.

268
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,080
Wouldn't it be horrible if you know, what hospital does Roger work at? I got to make sure that I

269
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:06,640
don't go to wherever he is. Anyway, so I check out this commercial he's got for his tour of the

270
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,080
the former Kerry Cottage.

271
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:20,080
Gilford Helmet first has to, in this unique 20 minute guided tour, you'll be able to experience what he's

272
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,240
like to be. Adam Kerry in his old house. You'll be able to see firsthand the luxury space

273
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,400
attached family home with ample of road parking. Where Adam has broadcast his groundbreaking

274
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,360
shared for the last two years. Based in a rural setting in the Surrey area,

275
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,240
nearly a short walk away from local amenities. You'll be able to look at the mirror laid

276
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,240
an ensuite bedroom where Adam used to make love to the lady Patricia. Although it's now an

277
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,440
empty house, there are still some remains of the legendary park caster that used to live there.

278
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,760
Imagine if you will the opportunity to fund the door knobs that have been grabbed by the

279
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,280
very saying show bit hands to touch Michael Jackson on the body. And if that's not what it's

280
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,560
the 1000 pound entry fee, then I don't know what it says. You'll be the envy of all your friends

281
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:15,120
when you tell them that you've used the same toilet as Malina Epocasting Tycoon, Mr. Adam Kerry.

282
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,640
Although it will cost extra to use the toilet, due to the water's been shut up and it's

283
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,000
described as hassle getting one down after. He wants to know what he's like to walk through a famous

284
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,320
person's living room, sniff their seat, so just lay on a discarded sponge mattress in the garden,

285
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,320
and this door is for you. You're interested in taking this once in a lifetime tour with your family

286
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,440
than email me, Roger and the school's small and I hope mail, okay, that you can. You have to

287
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,600
access to this property, we'll soon be occupied again, which is we do like it to remain a broadcasting

288
00:20:51,600 --> 00:21:02,960
history museum, sadly it isn't. Back to now, Roger. Guys, unbelievable. Roger, what are you doing,

289
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:13,360
man? Before I forget, big love to PD love the Daddycast Daddycast.com for the opening there,

290
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,000
for the Properties Owners Association. I PD loves always sending cool shit, man. I'll

291
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,080
open up the show with. Okay, a couple things before I get to Trinity and the free Trinity campaign.

292
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,360
Even though everything's been solved, you know, Comcast, rejigled the wires, so Lord knows how

293
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,800
long it'll take for the wires to come undone. I will say though that the telco closet is still open.

294
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,520
The guy was nice enough to insert my piece of cardboard again so that I can get access to it.

295
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,080
I'm pretty sure that it was just a loose coax. But anyway, I was complaining about

296
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,520
not being able to connect anyone's Wi-Fi anymore because, you know, the Wi-Fi's are all closed up,

297
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:00,320
no one's leaving their boxes open. And I received an interesting comment from the man.

298
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:07,040
Hey, Adam, this is David. I'm listening to episode number 529 and I'm calling in regards to your

299
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:15,600
comments about leaving access points open on wireless. Adam, I'm a sheriff's deputy at a agency

300
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:24,560
in Southeast Texas. And I could say that leaving your wireless open, your AP's is not really

301
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:32,240
a good idea because we had a local family that had done that, you know, they bought these

302
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:40,240
with the router from Best Buy or For Eyes or something and took it home and fired it up.

303
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,400
And, you know, Woo-hoo, we're on the wireless internet out of the good old time. Well,

304
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:55,280
unknown to them, the person was downloading child pornography from their AP and it was tracked to that

305
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:03,120
internet connection. And so, lo and behold, the police show up that they're door and discover, you

306
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:11,600
know, I was in a Wi-Fi and a kid, then obviously none of that going on. They had their computer

307
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,400
checked and it turned out okay. Well, what was happening was someone was using the wireless to

308
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,600
get that sort of stuff off the internet. So anyway, there's not a better reason to lock down your

309
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:33,040
AP out on the what is. So anyways, just my two cents worse. Joy to show. Thank you very much.

310
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,040
We'll see you. I just realized I'm completely hammered listening to the deputy talk about child

311
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:47,840
pornography through wireless access points. Just kind of hit me funny. Your deputy. Appreciate it, man.

312
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,640
Yeah, obviously that can happen. But, you know, I think there's a lot more we can do for society

313
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,280
by leaving him open that seems like, you know, and particularly when I get to the Trinity project,

314
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:04,080
which I'm getting to, folks, you understand why. What's going to say something about that,

315
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:11,440
which of course, no, oh yeah, deputy. Hey, man, you know, send back a comment or call in again.

316
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,720
And tell me where you listen to the show, do you listen to the show while you're on the

317
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,960
beat while you're in the cruiser? I want to know, seriously. That's pretty cool.

318
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,320
Okay. Well, we're getting very close.

319
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:41,520
But first, it's a combined sponsored content message. I had it. It's all from the fire of items.

320
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:49,440
Potwork.potshow.com. I'm sitting here at my favorite coffee shop and I'm in myself a couple of

321
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:59,200
letting. And I just got to think about these, the sponsor of yours. Splendid. I can't find it anywhere.

322
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,360
I tried to buy it on Amazon, but the computer says now.

323
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:12,800
And, um, let me try to buy it on eBay, but I ended up buying Cubans.

324
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,960
And later found 50 pieces of French vanilla and 50 pieces of hazelnut and no markers. I don't want to

325
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,680
buy 100 pieces and not get all flavors. So, I got a suggestion for you.

326
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:37,600
Ship Trinity to the fire violence and filler with Splendid. Have a Splendid day and I'm

327
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,800
quite a way music used in the intro and outro is stingray with the song last night and you find it on

328
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:52,880
music and watch other. And one last thing folder here. Stingray? Okay, I got to check it out.

329
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:03,200
I hadn't actually caught that the first time I listened to during show prep. That was his music.

330
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,040
So I'll have to check that out. I'll play it for you dude. So that was just one of the many

331
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:15,520
suggestions that came in. Of course, what came in the other day was a dog. I think his name is Doug.

332
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,880
Once it takes his 18 year old kid or 19 year old son on a drive across country and

333
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,720
in Trinity from San Francisco to Boston. And everybody pretty much loves the idea.

334
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,800
There's been just like the end of the day and I even got I haven't got some some emails from

335
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:38,720
people inside HQ who also came up with a similar concept. Obviously, this is from

336
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,000
Yorus from Flanders in Belgium. He says, wouldn't it be cool to have her Pendle coast to coast

337
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,040
and back for a certain period switching drivers at each coast? Trinity could promote biodiesel as

338
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,920
well as the podcasting along the way with interviewing, I'm reading it for beta, obviously,

339
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,440
with interviewing or giving interview to from all kinds of people. Maybe you can draw attention to

340
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,200
the stunt by traditional media to get the podcasting biodiesel known in a far greater group of people.

341
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,040
Also, great promotion for Podshow and very nice content too. For example, daily or weekly

342
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,520
updates in DSC and how things are going besides the Trinity feed of audio video content made

343
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,480
by the drivers of the project itself. So I received a lot of things just like that and

344
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,080
I still want to explore it and I don't want to anyone to get their hopes up. It's just on a

345
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,360
kind of exploratory phase here. But I think this could turn into something reasonably big.

346
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:46,800
What if we did kind of a version, a podcast version of tagging someone or passing the baton that

347
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,440
you see on, I don't participate in them anymore. Someone tags you and then you have to,

348
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,480
what's the latest one? You have to blog of five things and nobody knows about you.

349
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:05,920
Yeah, it's like okay. I haven't had time for masturbation. I'm gonna go write five things about you.

350
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:14,640
Yeah, there's one. There's one of my five things. Okay, so I think we could work together and

351
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,560
the more we work together, the cooler this would be. So what if we started in San Francisco? And this

352
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,080
is I'm just ideating here. We started in San Francisco and then we said okay, we're going to get

353
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:33,440
across the United States in 100 mile increments. So whoever is driving Trinity from San Francisco

354
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,560
to 100 miles east essentially northeast or southeast, that's okay too. We don't have to go in a

355
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:45,280
straight line. You know, there's an agreement with someone else down the line who preferably

356
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,880
is a podcast or knows how to podcast or the person who was driving over is a podcast or you know,

357
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,880
so we can kind of hand it off, introduce new people to the concept. And I want to have it in video.

358
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,480
Audio is great too. I love to, I mean, I'd love to have an audio and a video version.

359
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,480
We could really, really keep this going. And then I thought to myself, well,

360
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,680
maybe if we pimped her out just a little bit with some, with some help from some friends

361
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:18,560
of the show, I'm looking at you, Nokia. What if we put some kind of device, right, if we

362
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:25,200
put some form of mobile device that was bolted on to her, you know, the could not be removed,

363
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,560
you know, always had power, even if she, if the battery were dead, there was still, you know,

364
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,880
like have a solar cell or some kind of backup, you know, a real geeky piece of hardware,

365
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,480
something just go, you know, something that you'll, you'll put on make dot com later on,

366
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,400
you know, because it's so fucking cool. And of course, it has GPS capability, it has

367
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,880
GPS or 3G, whatever, connectivity through cell connectivity. You see where I'm going with Nokia,

368
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:59,600
right? And it has a camera. And so it's basically report back to base at some, you know,

369
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,040
predetermined frequency with their location, which we display on a frapper map. So we can track

370
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,520
Trinity's progress. And we can, of course, plot out where she's going to go next. And then when you roll

371
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,040
over, you know, you can listen to the podcast, see the video podcast that was uploaded. You see where I'm going.

372
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,880
So I would really want to, you know, I would love for, for Pod Show to step up to this. It's a big

373
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:27,680
project if we want to do it right. But if we can get a couple of, uh, a couple of developers to, you know,

374
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,560
to put together some thoughts. And it's fun. The reason why I come up with Nokia is because

375
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,760
you've been talking about them a lot. And I like this new N800. The N800 might actually with a

376
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,520
little bit of love from some developers might actually be a perfect device to do this with in

377
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,200
in conjunction with some kind of, you know, cell phone for connectivity. But, you know, it's based

378
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,320
on Linux. So it's pretty much bullet proof as a, as a mobile platform. You know, it has great battery

379
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,160
life. It has a built in camera. There's, you know, it's a shitty, there's no application that

380
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,080
really does pictures properly yet. It has just like a three megapixel camera. And it looks like

381
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,800
crap when you, with the application that comes with it. So, you know, let's fix that. Doesn't seem

382
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:16,320
like it should be too hard. And we'll get Nokia to, you know, pay for, uh, for Pod Show, uh, to

383
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,960
put some full-time people on it. You know, it's called, uh, doing something cool and making someone

384
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,560
else pay for it. And if not, then we'll do it in our own way. And we'll get as much done as we can.

385
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:34,320
But of course, my job would be to find some kind of sponsor like that. Now, the real point here

386
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:45,040
would be to show that we do care. Now, come on, Trinity stands for something. Trinity is a symbol

387
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:53,040
of, um, independence from big oil. And obviously, she's going to be driving coast to coast

388
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,200
back and forth. It just could go on for years. There's nothing to say. You know, and if she breaks

389
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,080
down, we've got to work together. We got to, you know, figure out what we have to do. Right now,

390
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,640
I've already started. I mean, she was a tote off today, uh, getting a complete overhaul,

391
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,720
getting ready for the trip to wherever she goes. And totally, it's got to be saved the world

392
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:22,000
win valuable prizes. Free Trinity.com. I love that so much. And Doug, I'm, I'm, I'm not completely

393
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,960
sold on any idea yet. I'm just trying to get something going. We can get some people who really want

394
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:35,280
to work on this. I'm game. I really am, because it could be incredibly cool. But, you know, if, if I,

395
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,200
if I tried internally to say, okay, let's build this device, you know, it would take forever,

396
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,840
you know, it says, we're busy. We go through a whole bunch of process.

397
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:54,560
Man, those engineers we have are so unbelievable. Again, so much shit done. So much. And I got, like,

398
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:01,840
a million fucking ideas. Anyway. So, so there's no way I could, uh, I could do this internally in

399
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:08,720
pod show. There's no way. But I think a couple of guys, I can get either box. That's, that's no problem.

400
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,760
But look at the benefit for Nokia. Nokia towards a greener future in America.

401
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:26,880
Nokia and Trinity for a greener America. I, in a world. Yeah.

402
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,640
All right, so if you want to participate, I'm game. I'll definitely get someone, you know,

403
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,720
helping me out to coordinate all the shit. And we'll make a real, we'll make something cool out of it.

404
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,480
I swear, I had another email. Let me see if I can find that one last second.

405
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:58,640
Oh, man, I hope I saved that. Oh, crap. Oh, I'm, I'm sorry about this. It's just so much that

406
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,320
that came in, but there was this one. Oh, why can't I find it?

407
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:15,200
All right. Well, I'm sorry. I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, it was so well set up.

408
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,920
Anyway, believe me, people are ready to do this. There are companies that want to jump on board,

409
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:27,520
the one sponsor, and besides all that, the pure sheer energy of Trinity has brought the Jeff Smith

410
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,680
back to the daily source code. Yes, Jeff's okay as predictor. He's just been really, really busy.

411
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,920
With his dueling pianos and his podcasting business.

412
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,880
Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, free Trinity, save the world, win valuable prizes.

413
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,400
Jeff, I love your man, fantastic. Look, we got a theme song. So, you know, when you got a theme song,

414
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,320
you're practically there. You're on your way. Stuff is already happening.

415
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,960
All right. I got to compose myself, Sandra Huxbergon. He sent stuff in before that he's created

416
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:39,680
home. He's got a new company called podcast studio podcaststudio.nl. And he will produce podcasts for you.

417
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,920
He'll put stuff together. He'll come out with creative concepts. He's starting a business.

418
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,360
And he's sending us, I guess, his wears to show what he can do.

419
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,880
Anyone's in suck off my podcast anytime. Oh, that'll make a nice outtake for someone somewhere.

420
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,720
Grab him. Took a candle's lid. I got a little incest's got incense.

421
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,520
I'm frustrated. He won't pay me 20 bucks. I said that I did for free.

422
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,680
Well, as long as he kissed the ring of your bitch.

423
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,120
I need my laptop in the bathroom and I'm listening to something. I'll take it a shower.

424
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,520
I need a couch. I need a kitchen. I need to be able to watch the morning bed, you know.

425
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:23,920
I need bandwidth coming through. I can't be restricted to one spot. This is the sucks. Oh, baby.

426
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,080
I'm doing my probing. I'm probing around. I gotta tell you, I really thoroughly enjoyed myself.

427
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,920
It was, it's working for the girls. I'm a kind of knock-in-eat.

428
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,240
We're there. We're not as candlestick. They creative juices are just flowing and anyone can suck

429
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,840
off my podcast anytime. And by the way, what happened to humanity? No one's leaving their

430
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:52,640
wife eyes open anymore. Oh, that's so sad. I said that I do for free. As long as he kissed the ring of the

431
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,920
your bitch bitch, it has a crisp, cool, cool kind of feeling. I need bandwidth coming through.

432
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,760
I can't be restricted to one spot. This is the sucks. I grabbed my laptop. I plugged the laptop in

433
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,440
and I'm telling you, I had like super fast internet. These are the nights that I really love.

434
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,320
It's a honder. I should have prefaced that this was under the title. Should the daily source

435
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,480
code be explicit or not? I was so into that whole thing about Trinity, I totally forgot about

436
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,640
the serious satellite stars. One, two listeners. And I don't even know where it caught off. So

437
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,480
Peter, I was going to hate me. Although he loves me, I know he loves me just a little bit more these days

438
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,640
because when he gets up at six o'clock in the morning and he already has a show that he can put

439
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:48,640
into the line up. I know he loves that. All right, one last song. I know something about, well,

440
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:56,240
you know, it's the whole candle and night time vibe means urban out or something like that

441
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:04,480
at least it's a pod safe, if not unpronounceable. I want to be with Angelina Jolie, I want to be

442
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:17,520
would be happy together forever. I go to bed and I wake up with a dream in my head. I pass you the

443
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:27,920
cream and some bread as we're having breakfast together. With Peter singing birds flying together

444
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:42,320
I'm carrying you on my wings first storms and that weather. We share our dreams while sleeping together.

445
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,960
We share the same thoughts without speaking, never a word.

446
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:18,960
I want to be with Angelina Jolie, I want to be a word that touches her lips and music

447
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:28,000
divine that sounds in her mind. With Peter singing birds flying together

448
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,360
I'm carrying you on my wings through storms and that weather.

449
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:48,160
We share our dreams while sleeping together. We share the same thoughts without speaking

450
00:39:48,960 --> 00:40:04,400
never a word. I want to be with Angelina Jolie, I want to be. We'd be happy together forever.
