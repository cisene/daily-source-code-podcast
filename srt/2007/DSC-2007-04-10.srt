4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You're traveling through another dimension.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
A journey into the wondersland whose boundaries are that of imagination.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You unlock this door with the key of imagination.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Beyond it, another dimension.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A dimension of sound.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A dimension of sight.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A dimension of mind.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance of things and ideas.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There's a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is the dimension of imagination.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's a signpost of a head, your next stop.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The Delta Sierra, Charlie.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Five, seven, nine.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm just in here as a free.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So I can play the role of the world.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're safe, you're right, you're right.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're inside, yeah.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're mine, you're the loyal one.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're down, down, and I won.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're mine, you're blue.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm so down and down, and I won.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I promise that I've got to try and quit.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're watching me just my way.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're me, me, me, me.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Plus a thousand million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're playing those little monsters, hey, hey.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm lying down and down, I won.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're blue.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The world is the world

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Showdown in the sky

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The world is the world

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The world is the world

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Made in the world

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're the world

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And I know all

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The world is the world

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And I know all

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The world is the world

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And I know all

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sometimes a song could just say it all

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Can it?

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Back on the way

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's bubble

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hey everybody how you doing

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Coming to you from

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Beverly Hills

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
California

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's right

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So Cal for a change

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's the Daily Source Code

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Episode number five

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
179

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Nowadays it's for you

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's Tuesday

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's Tuesday

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
April 10

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
An extra day added to my

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Stay out here

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In California on the west coast

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Wasn't quite prepared for it

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Which of course means

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You know I have everything timed

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
All right

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Running on empty my friends

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If you know what I'm saying

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Very low

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We're down to seeds and stems

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Once again

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh boy

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Sorry about yesterday

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Typical typical

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh man

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It started on Sunday

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We had a video project

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That the fabulous fat man

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Was working on

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
With the

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The Boise Mafia

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In Idaho

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Believe me it's all code

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That people at Pod Show

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And he felt ill

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Which sucks

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Sucks ass

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Because something in his inner ear

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And it's like vertigo

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And it's really hard to do video editing

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
When you're not

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
When you get queasy

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And just from breathing

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So that meant that we had to gather

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
All kinds of assets

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Burn them on a DVD

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So most of Sunday

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Was actually spent doing that

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Didn't get to tell you about

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
About Saturday

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Went out and bought some clothes

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Do you know how

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hard it is to find

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
34 waste and 36 in scene

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It is almost impossible

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The only thing available

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Is either

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Custom Taylor made

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Which

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't know

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm not looking for that

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I just want some cool pants

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You know

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What are my other options?

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They did have

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
36 34

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That was presented to me several times

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Finally

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I did find a store

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What was the name of that store

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Which I threw the bag out

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If you're in San Francisco on market

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You go past the mall

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You go past the house

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A blue jeans and you go past

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Like all of a sudden

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The neighborhood changes

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And the street kind of gets a little smelly

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And there was like

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's a men's designer

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I hung a left right in

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And I was in the middle of

144
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hip Hop heaven man

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I tell you

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So I scored me some pants

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That I'm sure Patricia will never let me wear

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Never let me wear

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And so not in my suitcases

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There's 75 pounds in weight

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's just unbelievable

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Anyway

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Flu to Los Angeles

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Sunday afternoon

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Got in

156
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And of course

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Because of all this mess up

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Had to start downloading stuff

159
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Have you ever

160
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Try to rely on a hotel network

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I mean even the Beverly Hills hotel

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Which is

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Where we usually stay

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
When we're in

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
In LA

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It just sucks man

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I know that after midnight

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
When finally

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Whoever was downloading porn

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Stop doing it

171
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I was able to download a lot of stuff

172
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Pretty quickly

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I had

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Ten

175
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I think at least

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ten

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Fifty megabyte files

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I was downloading simultaneously

179
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And I know that

180
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I was crunching the whole hotel

181
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That works

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So it was a little bit of

183
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A little bit of revenge

184
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That I got

185
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But oh man

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's so horrible

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
When by the time you're done

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's like three in a morning

189
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Get up at seven

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We got our first meeting

191
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And

192
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I will tell you about

193
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Some of these meetings

194
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Rather interesting

195
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
These are all upon

196
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Invitations

197
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But first

198
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
An email from Cassandra

199
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Hey Adam

200
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
On

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Daily source code episode

202
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Five

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Seventy-eight

204
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That was the Fubar Friday

205
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
From No Cal

206
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You said it

207
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And I just had to send it to you

208
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Haha

209
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's right

210
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
How did I

211
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
How did I

212
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How did I start

213
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh that's right

214
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It was the word phenomena

215
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I kept saying phenomena

216
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And then phenomena

217
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And then I went into phenomena

218
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Or was it

219
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Manamana

220
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hit it

221

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This makes you happy

223
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Doesn't it?

224
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
A day just starts right

225
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Manamana

226
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
When you hear this song

227
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I know you know the lyrics

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let's go crazy

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000

Banana.

252
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
Come on.

253
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,740
Yeah.

254
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
Banana.

255
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
Banana.

257
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,740
Banana.

258
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,740

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,740
Banana.

264
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740

267
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
Banana.

268
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,740
Banana.

269
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,740
Yeah.

270
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,740
The Muppets, the Minamena, saw him.

271
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,740
Wonderful.

272
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
Bravo.

273
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,740
I love that.

274
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,740
I'll find the song on YouTube for a cell phone.

275
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,740
I'll put a link in the show notes.

276
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,740
To be found at dailysourcecode.com.

277
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,740
It was awful.

278
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Come away.

279
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
Boom.

280
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
Boom.

281
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,740
I missed those two old guys.

282
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,740
Yeah.

283
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,740
Sorry for breaking the podsafe code of conduct.

284
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Oh, speaking of which.

285
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,740
I just saw that today.

286
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,740
The famous A-Lister.

287
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
Tim O'Reilly.

288
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,740
Let me just see if I can find this link for you.

289
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,740
Actually suggested a, you know, this thing that's been going around ever since the Kathy Sierra.

290
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,740
Configuration.

291
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,740
He suggested a code of conduct.

292
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,740
And this thing just it literally had me rolling.

293
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,740
About the things we we should and should not do.

294
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
Which include don't say anything online.

295
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,740
We wouldn't say in person, please.

296
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,740
We connect privately before before we respond publicly blah blah blah.

297
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,740
When we believe someone is unfairly attacking another we take action.

298
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,740
This is like it's like the king is dead.

299
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
Long live the king.

300
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,740
You know, it's like what happened to the the anarchistic part of the web.

301
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
Believe me.

302
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Believe me when I say, oh, he's never even as a badge.

303
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
Civility enforced.

304
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,740
It's pathetic, dude.

305
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,740
This is not the way it's going to go.

306
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,740
It's going.

307
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,740
I keep saying it's going to get a whole lot worse before gets any better.

308
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,740
Because we're just exercising these muscles would just figuring out that the old

309
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,740
added really is true that the pen is much much

310
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,740
Mightyer than the sword and free speech.

311
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
You want it.

312
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,740
Dude.

313
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
You've got it online.

314
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,740
Now, of course, that doesn't mean that you can go and threaten people.

315
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,740
But this is what happens.

316
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
What happens when you get your 15 minutes.

317
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Everything is going to come true that these guys predicted from Andy Warhol.

318
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,740
Right down to the the pen is Mightyer than the sword.

319
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,740
Who wrote that?

320
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
Mark Yoshimura Namkov.

321
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
I think.

322
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,740
So I have to DJ here from Australia.

323
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Hey.

324
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,740
All my songs are up on the pod save music network.

325
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,740
And whenever a song is played on a podcast, I download the show that it was played on and have a listen.

326
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,740
And I'll often subscribe to that show.

327
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,740
Well, is one that came through just a day or two ago.

328
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,740
Have a listen to it.

329
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,740
Interactive issues.

330
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,740
Yeah.

331
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,740
Yeah.

332
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:20,740
I don't know what language that is, but it's not Russian, but sounds very similar.

333
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,740
But made me think of you.

334
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
Anyway, have a good one.

335
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,740
I do.

336
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,740
I sounded like a Italian.

337
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
I'm not sure, but that burp.

338
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
I definitely influenced that.

339
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
And I'm damn proud of it.

340
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,740
Listen, because the guy actually he burps.

341
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,740
And then he says something something podcasting moment.

342
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Which can only mean that this is a true sign of a real podcast.

343
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,740
Turn this on.

344
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
Do it.

345
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,740
Let's hear it again.

346
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,740
I'm a dickie.

347
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,740
Yeah.

348
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,740
podcasting moment.

349
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,740
podcasting moments.

350
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Funko popular.

351
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,740
Fantastic.

352
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,740
I got nailed it to airport security.

353
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Gosh, it's been going so well with my lighters.

354
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,740
I don't know if you heard me lighting up the match.

355
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,740
Beverly Hills Hotel, man.

356
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,740
They give you like a book of matches, which is really fancy and stuff.

357
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,740
But it only has like 15 matches in it.

358
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,740
And they're really high quality.

359
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,740
Yeah.

360
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,740
I usually put my lighter behind my creative labs.

361
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,740
PC, PCI.

362
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,740
I was a PC card, which is my external sound card, which I plug into my via.

363
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,740
Whenever I'm going to record a show, which of course leads into cast blasts or

364
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,740
does all that beautiful stuff.

365
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,740
Because when you place the lighter behind a piece of electronics, they can't really identify

366
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,740
it.

367
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,740
And that's been working for me for a couple of months.

368
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,740
And they'd certainly nail me at SFO on the way to LAX.

369
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,740
And they knew it, man.

370
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,740
From the minute the scan happens, like, lighter.

371
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,740
Oh, shit.

372
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,740
So not only down to stems and seeds, but down to wood and sulfur, it's getting pretty bad.

373
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,740
So we were here upon invitation.

374
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,740
And we're staying an extra day because there's a number of people we want to meet.

375
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,740
By the way, the last I forget at the top of the show, Sharon Bam.

376
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:19,740
You know them as the producers and share, of course, as the host of the Rock and Old TV show with the song Holly

377
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,740
would down and out and Hollywood man, just perfect song.

378
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,740
I love with those guys.

379
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,740
They do it under the Moniker bubble.

380
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,740
There's a link in the show notes to that at dailysourcecode.com.

381
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,740
So I'm here in my room.

382
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,740
And if you can hear it, I don't have the my normal processing stuff.

383
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,740
So you can, you know what?

384
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,740
I have quite a long wire.

385
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
We haven't done this in a while.

386
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
Let's see if I can take it outside.

387
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,740
I'm carrying the hot.

388
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,740
Now this is about as far as we'll go.

389
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,740
The high LPR 40.

390
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,740
I'm now standing on the balcony.

391
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,740
See if I can pick up any sounds for you.

392
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
So quiet here.

393
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,740
It's fantastic.

394
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,740
I'm overlooking the tennis court.

395
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,740
You can hear a little bit of road noise off in the distance, but just barely.

396
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,740
It's really nice.

397
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,740
I'm on a good side of the hotel this time.

398
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,740
So despite no ban with this pretty good.

399
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,740
We hear an invitation from two talent agencies.

400
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,740
Creative artists.

401
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,740
Agency and the William Morris Agency both.

402
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,740
Want to represent us.

403
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,740
And you got to understand how Holly would work.

404
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,740
The guys that do the packaging.

405
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,740
So it's not like we're going to get an already fly shirt type agent who's going to

406
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,740
run around and teels for us.

407
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,740
But let me explain how it works.

408
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,740
So a company like Creative artists represents represent a lot of people.

409
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,740
They represent Steven Spielberg.

410
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,740
They also represent Hasbro Toys.

411
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,740
And what they do is they'll say, let's see.

412
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,740
We've got Hasbro Toys.

413
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Hasbro, what do you guys have coming up?

414
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,740
We've got this, this, you know, we've had this pretty successful line of toys.

415
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,740
It's called a Transformers.

416
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,740
Oh, that's what we got Steven Spielberg.

417
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,740
Why don't we do the Transformers the movie?

418
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,740
And then they go and they get the script and they get the writers and the readwright and

419
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,740
they get the funding and they put it all together.

420
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,740
And so the things that that we've been talking about.

421
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,740
Really threefold, I guess.

422
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:20,740
One is how can we help our shows and our producers.

423
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,740
They can't export and syndicate into other avenues.

424
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,740
And how can we get some of their clients?

425
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,740
And they have between the two of them.

426
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,740
They have just about everybody in Hollywood.

427
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
How can we bring them into our world?

428
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,740
Because we know they want to come and they're telling us that.

429
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,740
Not not not not the Hollywood celebrities and superstars.

430
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,740
And I'm not talking just about actors and TV host.

431
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,740
I'm talking about authors, comedians, people who are on the talking circuits.

432
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,740
I mean, there's just tons of people who are extremely interesting and

433
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,740
really want to break into independent media.

434
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:02,740
Realize that the kind of money they may be used to or they think that they can

435
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:08,740
command in the traditional world is at this point probably not possible.

436
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,740
And independent media, but they really want to go for it.

437
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:17,740
They just want to go with a company that's got their shit together.

438
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,740
And so it really surprises they call us.

439
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,740
And tomorrow at tomorrow we're just going to hang out and meet with a couple of people.

440
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,740
I've been trying to get a whole of these g-living dude.

441
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
Have you ever seen that show?

442
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,740
G-living live?

443
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
This green stuff, man.

444
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,740
It's really, really taken off.

445
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,740
That's such an incredible industry in the green living space.

446
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,740
Speaking of sucking.

447
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,740
Comic strip.

448
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Comic strip.

449
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
Comic strip.

450
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
Comic strip.

451
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,740
Comic strip.

452
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,740
Comic strip.

453
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,740
Comic strip.

454
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Comic strip.

455
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,740
I found the jingle again, can you tell?

456
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,740
Hello, I'm Kerry.

457
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,740
Hello.

458
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,740
Here is comic strip.

459
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
Blogger from comicsstable.com.

460
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,740
You know, you know it very well that you are surrounded by escises, brown noses.

461
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:15,740
And these people are blinding your view to the reality and the real problems of podcasts

462
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,740
and so on.

463
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,740
And also everybody is sucking up to you.

464
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,740
Yes.

465
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,740
So I have to tell you.

466
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
Fuck you.

467
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,740
If you're kind of helping in this issue, this issue is there.

468
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,740
Let me tell you.

469
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,740
This is the approach that my parents taught me as well.

470
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,740
This is the way to get things done in life.

471
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,740
You set someone up and say, look, your ass is being kissed.

472
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
If you don't help me, fuck you.

473
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,740
You've got my attention.

474
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,740
I have purchased a domain for a new podcast that I would like to make.

475
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,740
And I have sent you the name of this domain.

476
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,740
And also I have sent a question to the support of Podshow.

477
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,740
So shortly speaking, I have a domain, internet domain.

478
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,740
Something something something cast.com.

479
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:04,740
And now I would like to host podcasts on Podshow.com.

480
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:11,740
Your service, but I would like to have this podcast to be on your own domain.

481
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,740
Something similar to your daily source code.com.

482
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,740
Daily source code.com is serviced by Podshow.com.

483
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,740
And I have sent the DNS service for this domain to ns1.com

484
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,740
and ns2.potshow.com.

485
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,740
And in the control panel in Podshow.com, I have sent the two children to this domain,

486
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,740
but it is not working, please.

487
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,740
Please help me out.

488
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,740
You help me.

489
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,740
See you on May 8th.

490
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,740
Hopefully after I've helped you.

491
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,740
And at the time, show it to me this day.

492
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Yeah, I do.

493
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,740
I think that's going to work out CSB on May 4th because the lady Patricia is going to be going

494
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
all that week.

495
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,740
So I know I'm going to be in the UK.

496
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,740
I'll just have to clear it with the lady Christina with the pod daughter.

497
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,740
Let me just check this man because that's supposed to work.

498
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,740
I'm not sure what the problem is.

499
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:07,740
But from the very beginning, we made sure that you could map a domain name to your podshow

500
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
show site.

501
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
Let me just see.

502
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,740
Is it under show info?

503
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
I think.

504
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,740
Let me just check.

505
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
Yeah.

506
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,740
I think you're not supposed to point the domain name service to our servers.

507
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
I think.

508
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,740
Let me just see if it says anything about that basic information.

509
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
And description.

510
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
I know it works.

511
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,740
Oh, here it is.

512
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,740
Do you have a shit.

513
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,740
I'm sorry.

514
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
Just click the way from it.

515
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,740
Let me just read what it says.

516
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
Here we go.

517
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,740
Do you have an existing website for your show, indicate the full URL here, and then you

518
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,740
have to add a domain.

519
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,740
I'm pretty sure you have to point it to our servers, but not to our DNS servers, CSB.

520
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,740
But I am looking at this.

521
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,740
I know when you sign up.

522
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,740
And when you create a new show that it is explained.

523
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:02,740
In fact, you can even buy a GoDaddy domain name with a discount when you sign up to podshow.

524
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,740
And it'll map automatically.

525
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,740
But I can see here that you're right.

526
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,740
The askcissors have done a horrible job.

527
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,740
What they have not done is they have not made it clear when you go back and want to add

528
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,740
a domain name.

529
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,740
Okay.

530
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,740
I'll look into that for sure.

531
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,740
And we've got this big move coming up.

532
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:27,740
I already hear the data slip that was supposed to be the Friday, the 13th, the 13th of April.

533
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
This coming Friday.

534
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:34,740
The day coincidentally when I go on vacay, leaving for Tanya Rifei going on vacation.

535
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,740
It's slip I think until maybe Monday.

536
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,740
So everyone's crazy busy.

537
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,740
They really are.

538
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,740
And you joke about it CSB, but these people are really fucking smart dude.

539
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,740
And you'll meet a couple of them in the UK on May 4.

540
00:21:52,740 --> 00:22:05,740
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip.

541
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,740
Have you ever heard of the whispered Peroles podcast Michelle?

542
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,740
As Blasque I think, host of that show.

543
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,740
It's a very sensual, very erotic show.

544
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,740
She has a fantastic voice.

545
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,740
And she's really, really made my day.

546
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,740
Hey Adam, she writes an email.

547
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,740
What's this crap about you never receiving naked pictures?

548
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,740
Obviously the ones I sent you never reached you.

549
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,740
So here they are again.

550
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,740
As I said previously, now you've seen all the nipples from the whispered Peroles girls.

551
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,740
Hopefully this will brighten up your LA trip a bit.

552
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,740
Cheers from Michelle from whispered Peroles.

553
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Michelle, this did not only cheer up my day a little bit in LA.

554
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,740
This told me that podcasting has arrived when I can create a show on my

555
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,740
Dinky laptop and get naked pictures and return for it.

556
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,740
This is true.

557
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Showbidden this baby and I'm loving it.

558
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,740
And what we need now to end this Charlie is a Hollywood ending.

559
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:10,740
She's gonna come through, but you can spend your whole life pretending it.

560
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,740
Gonna go let me for you too.

561
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,740
Cause only you.

562
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:27,740
I'm gonna go let me for you too.

563
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,740
Cause only you know our secret heart.

564
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,740
She doesn't need to be unkind.

565
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,740
And the waiting is not so hard.

566
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,740
What's a little more.

567
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,740
Time.

568
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,740
We are.

569
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,740
For this was something.

570
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
I'm smarter than this.

571
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:06,740
Oh, swallow whatever you like.

572
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,740
We are.

573
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,740
For something.

574
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,740
She's your loveiest weakness.

575
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:24,740
She was my longest goodbye.

576
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,740
Hey, I know just where you are.

577
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,740
It up, every last word.

578
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:42,740
And you swore you never let it get this far and you never get hurt.

579
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,740
Hey, I know I can't change your mind.

580
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,740
Like you can't change your heart.

581
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,740
Hey, I know the cliché.

582
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,740
Love is blind, but whom it could be so dark.

583
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,740
We are.

584
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,740
For this was something.

585
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,740
I'm smarter than this.

586
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:19,740
Oh, swallow whatever you like.

587
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,740
We are.

588
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,740
For something.

589
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,740
She's your loveiest weakness.

590
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:37,740
She was my longest goodbye.

591
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,740
A heart is trying.

592
00:25:49,740 --> 00:26:08,740
Don't you just love Hollywood and day in the naked tire.

593
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:14,740
She's gonna come through but you can spend your whole life.

594
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:24,740
She's gonna come through but you can spend your whole life.

595
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,740
She's gonna come through but you can spend your whole life.

596
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,740
She's gonna come through but you can spend your whole life.

597
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:38,740
She's gonna come through but you can spend your whole life.

598
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:48,740
She's gonna come through but you can spend your whole life.

599
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,740
She's gonna come through but you can spend your whole life.

600
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,740
She's gonna come through but you can spend your whole life.

601
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,740
She's gonna come through but you can spend your whole life.

602
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,740
She's gonna come through but you can spend your whole life.

603
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:13,740
She's gonna come through but you can spend your whole life.

604
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:20,740
Forstants of today's show brought to you by Tylenol P.M.

605
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,740
Sorry.

606
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,740
But you're done.

607
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:36,740
You're done.

608
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,740
It's off the hook.

609
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,740
It's like I know that we've been promoting it and promising it for months and months.

610
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,740
We should do that more often.

611
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,740
We should just delay the release because man, everyone just jumped on this thing.

612
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:58,740
First episode is a smackdown between the satellite repairman, PW Fenton and CC Chapman, a fantastic episode.

613
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:07,740
And the sponsor, the prize sponsor, no surprise for the prize, is Nokia and the winner of the Bond contest.

614
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,740
Walks away with a Nokia and 800 Internet tablet.

615
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

616
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,740
Do you heard how that came together?

617
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,740
Christian Leonard Quail said, Adam, I've had my N800 for quite a while now.

618
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
I simply love everything about it.

619
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,740
I could give you a list over why I love it but that list is getting too long these days.

620
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Without you I'd never have heard about this fantastic product.

621
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,740
I felt it owed to you to say thanks even though we can contribute to cluttering your mailbox.

622
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,740
Love the show keep on rocking Christian.

623
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,740
No man, I love it.

624
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,740
Thank you very much.

625
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,740
I appreciate it so much.

626
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,740
And as do our sponsors.

627
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,740
There you go.

628
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,740
Nokia, playing with us.

629
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,740
Thank you guys.

630
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,740
That's it for the Daily Source Code for today.

631
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,740
I'm not quite sure.

632
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,740
Yeah, I'll be doing Wednesday's show when I get in.

633
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:53,740
I think I'm getting in a little bit later than usual but we'll definitely crank out a show for you.

634
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,740
So tomorrow as I said, just some meetings and then then I'm off.

635
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,740
By the way, if you go to acurry.com, I have a little Twitter box there.

636
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:12,740
And I'm basically using it as kind of a broadcast mechanism and letting you guys know where I am in my in my travel.

637
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,740
Seeing if how that works for you if you get kind of a reality vibe, you know, some kind of connection.

638
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,740
Now that you know what my days are like.

639
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,740
And then you can actually follow along where I am.

640
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,740
So that's it.

641
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,740

642
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,740

So I'll crap it went out.
