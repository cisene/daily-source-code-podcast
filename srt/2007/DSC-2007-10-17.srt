Got to share Charlie 674.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Not say for $60 billion worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000

I know you feel like it.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I know you feel like it.

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I know you feel like it.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I know you feel like it.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I know you feel like it.

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I know you feel like it.

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I know you feel like it.

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I know you feel like.

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I know you feel like it.

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I know you feel like it.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I know you feel like it.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I know you feel like it.

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There you go. What you got to do is a half. I'm waiting for it. Just tell me what's the play.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
SuperLoxist Tokyo. Of course on the Pod State Music Network.

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll link to that in the show notes at DailySourceCode.com.

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's the show you're listening to right now.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Episode 674. Everybody, how you doing?

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Boy, I love this new trip we're on about F-Uing me at the end of every single comment.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Everything you send in, you know why? Because it's a social experiment I've been doing.

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And it works so well. I've discovered that if you encourage people to give that burst of energy at the end of a comment,

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
they fuck you, which of course is a perfectly acceptable term, perfectly acceptable language on this show.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And after nine o'clock on the BBC as well. It's perfectly acceptable, but it gives you such a buildup.

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You can just, ah, you can feel it in the comments. There's so succinct. It's really working.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And then one day eventually we'll be able to take off the F-U and we'll be great at providing feedback to each other.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
After of course, I learned how to do it in German.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hello, Adam. I just listened to 672 and I want to bring some personal advertisement for you.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, nice. In Germany, we say, thick day.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have thick day. That's FOXTRA in the Yachali Kilo.

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay, thick. Delta in the Yachali Hotel.

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hey, say, yeah, me, thick, thick.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hey, hey, hey. Everybody now. I hope that helps for you.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And I might come in Andy for your negotiations for the poster.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, yeah, that'll help.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So whatever you're going to do, I want to keep this caution because this building is a strong representation of your emotions.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And should not be used in a humorous way or to fire backwards, definitely.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's it for today.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And, um, and folder.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And, y'all.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, they're thick meat.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
All right.

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can just see me using that over in Germany. That'd be pretty funny.

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The noise you hear in the background is the heater.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I've got to cranked up, uh, you know, just to put a little blast of hot air into the attic.

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's even though the sun is shining, it's one of those beautiful autumn days where we've got blue skies again.

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, so nice.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, England gets such a bad rap for its weather, but it really has been just spectacular.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The leaves are turning color and it's a nice, crisp, cool atmosphere outside.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's a little bit behind today.

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm going to, uh, into the city.

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm staying overnight in the city, uh, because I got a couple of early meetings Thursday.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Um, had another meeting at, uh, at Unilever yesterday.

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I told you, which I have to say, uh, went very well, man.

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If we could, if we could reel these guys in, oh, they could do so much for our network.

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And we could do so much for them.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Uh, of course, as Patricia says, you're just staying overnight in London so that you can sleep with your girlfriend.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Adam, it's Mike UC from the UC radio pod show.

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, speaking of girlfriends.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And it was great to meet you out in Ontario, California at the, uh, PB and Jay, whatever the fuck they're calling that thing now.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You got to tell you, you're not as tall as Nemcoff makes you out to me.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But I guess when you're only five foot four, everybody's tall.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So that explains his perspective on things.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The, uh, reason I'm calling is there was a guy named Parkie that called it on show 672.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Uh, he's talking about gun control and all that and you blew it.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But you said that the boom town rats on was about a shooting that took place in the UK.

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Uh-huh.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It was actually about a shooting that took place at the Cleveland Elementary School in San Diego in 1979.

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
When they arrested the chicken, I think her name was Brenda Squires or Spencer or something like that.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They arrested her.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
After why she didn't, she said, I don't like Mondays.

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And a little fun fact used to live right down the street from that school.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Hey, listen, uh, the one last thing.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There it comes.

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Fuck you.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No way.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Wait.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Fuck you.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Nice.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hang on.

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hang on.

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You feel so motivated.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's what I get up for in the morning.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah, I blew it on that one, didn't I?

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
A couple of people emailed in about that.

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That was clearly a mistake.

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But I think the point, at least it was a well-made, that no one is immune from death by gun.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ah, they're flying today.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You know, jealous of you guys.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There's been a couple of comments about the second amendment of the United States Constitution, which, of course,

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
is kind of this trip I've been on since I found out about presidential Republican candidate,

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Dr. Ron Paul.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't think I've ever voted Republican that I can recall.

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I may have.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't know.

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I guess I have to think about it.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But it's certainly not the party I turn to.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's being the party of Bush.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But this guy, who, of course, is being labeled as, uh,

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
you by the mainstream media as a cook, internet phenomenon, et cetera.

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The cook who has been delivering, uh,

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
children to the world all his life who's, uh,

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
been in Congress for, uh,

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
10 terms or something crazy like that.

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He is, of course, uh, he's labeled, uh,

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
in Washington as Dr. No, because he always says no to everything.

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Uh, mainly things that he believes are illegal according to the Constitution.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So let's just examine this.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And I don't really want to dwell on it too much.

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Although I certainly will be talking to, uh,

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
to Dr. Ron about it when he calls into the show.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Where's that further on that, by the way?

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Just read the email.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Uh, so I got an email back from Don.

187
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Remember, I played his voice mail.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Uh, Adam gave your contact to info to Jesse Benton,

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
our communications director, Oops, hand off.

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We are very interested in Jesse assures me that he will be contacting you tomorrow.

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Thanks so much for your support, Don.

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay. All right.

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So still hopeful.

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Uh, if that campaign is really together, uh,

195
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
then I think they'll get in touch with me.

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I've reached out.

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I did what I was asked to do.

198
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So, um, here's a, is a pretty decent comment on, uh,

199
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
on what the second amendment means.

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Uh, and again, this is the rule book that was written for the United States.

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Only 220, some years ago to it in 25 years ago.

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Um, and it was, you know,

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
we have founding fathers.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Uh, it's, it's very traceable.

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This was the rule book that was written.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Uh, these, uh, you know, the, the Bill of Rights,

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
the amendments, the kind, the, uh,

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
uh, the Constitution, uh,

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
very much set in stone,

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
but not always, um,

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
interpreted the way it was intended.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Of course, everything's open for interpretation.

213
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Check this out.

214
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Adam Curry still wants to even San Francisco.

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I said a little bit of light on this gun thing.

216
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's going on.

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's good to talk about, um,

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
the accounting fathers had a debate.

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They were not letters to each other during the time

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
that they were creating constitution.

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And so, and we have those letters.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You can go and actually see what the context was.

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, that's nice.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Make sure you send me a link of the letters.

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'd love to read through those.

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes.

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sure we do have the context around this decision.

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's great.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Very great.

230
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
For instance, about the, uh, the second amendment.

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And what these guys were talking about at the time was

232
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
if you're having a debate between the idea of having you standing on me,

233
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
like we do today, um, or not.

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You know, why would you not have a standing on me?

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Do you fear explicitly that in the past standing on me

236
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
had been used against the citizenry of the countries

237
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that they were supposed to be protecting?

238
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So the little eerie doesn't it?

239
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Like, you know, we're kind of close to that.

240
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But the guys who, who were against the standing on me,

241
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
what?

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The compromise was, okay, here's how we're going to have an army

243
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
because we don't have to defend.

244
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What are we going to do?

245
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, we're going to let everybody have guns.

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And if we get invaded, it's kind of awkward to say.

247
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay.

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Well, there's your army.

249
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's every able-bodied man with a gun.

250
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oops.

251
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I had the mic close there for saying, yeah, which I think is,

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I agree with that assessment.

253
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And of course, that changed.

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And it would be interesting to know how a standing army

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
was put into place.

256
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And if that, she, I guess if that, the question is,

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
is that was that constitutional at the time,

258
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
fascinating stuff this, fascinating.

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'd love to read those letters.

260
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
There's your army.

261
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's the militia.

262
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's what they call it.

263
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And that's why it says, in the amendment itself,

264
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
that a well-on militia is necessary for the protection of the United States.

265
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Now, I'm not trying to see that's a caveat.

266
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The assessment will longer true.

267
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You don't have the right to be a gun.

268
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, actually, I think that it's specifically states for enemies

269
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
from outside or within.

270
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And of course, if you have the government controlling the army,

271
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and even worse, if your vice president is certainly very closely linked

272
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
to the war machine, that would be the companies that receive the money

273
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
to create weaponry.

274
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You know, that's a very, very dangerous conflict of interest situation.

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't you agree?

276
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And look at the guys who've been called, look at Donald Trump's felt.

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You know, look at the guys who've been calling the shots with,

278
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
with arm militia.

279
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Or, I guess, would say, with our standing army.

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Just might not have been such a great way to go.

281
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Tough, tough stuff this.

282
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Okay, let's go.

283
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But it's important that I think to understand what these guys were thinking.

284
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And it wasn't just, you know, we didn't say anything about going hunting.

285
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm sure these guys hunted, and I'm sure they have no problem with anybody else hunting.

286
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That wasn't what they were talking about.

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They were talking about, should we or should we not have a standing army?

288
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Context is changed.

289
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It makes the whole issue a lot more complicated.

290
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't think they saw this one coming.

291
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But this, I realize this doesn't change anything with that.

292
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It keeps to the base.

293
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But I think it's important to understand the context.

294
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Fuck you.

295
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Fuck you in the hearts you rode in on.

296
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Fuck you, Adam Curry.

297
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No.

298
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yo.

299
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
All right.

300
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah, you know, I think there are, so yeah, thank you very much for the comment.

301
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And I would love to read the context of that and understand how we made the transition from

302
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
an armed militia, basically every able, body person having a gun to protect from outside and within,

303
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
to a standing army.

304
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'd love to see where that transition was made purely from historical interest.

305
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I think there is some confusion, though.

306
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And I guess what the best thing for me to do is post a link to the constitution of the United States,

307
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
which is really important document.

308
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The documents are always important.

309
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So important, in fact, that both the Netherlands and France voted against the European Union constitution,

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
because they did not agree with what was in it.

311
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Probably very, very visionary menopped be the right word.

312
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But, you know, I think they were smart.

313
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
They read the document.

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And by the way, the European constitution for the European Union is quite a document.

315
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's not quite as simple as the Bill of Rights and the amendments and the U.S. constitution.

316
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's a real tone you have to get through.

317
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So people take this shit very seriously because it is the foundation of law.

318
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And so when I get this email from Ed, Ed Shubban says,

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Adam, I agree that Ron Paul seems like a candidate because he has several popular positions.

320
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I agree with many of those libertarian positions, and they do sound good.

321
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But think about these positions, no department of education, welfare, health care for children.

322
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
These are services.

323
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The government can and should deliver.

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
They improve our country and make it better.

325
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Probably wasn't when the constitution was written.

326
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I remember you describing a while ago how the NHS and Britain provided several benefits

327
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
to children such as parade, paid prescriptions.

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Right.

329
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So the point that I believe Dr. Ron is making on this is that this should be handled at a state level.

330
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
State level, not, and that's really a lot of the message.

331
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But the state governments are extremely important and should be providing for their immediate community.

332
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Makes a lot of sense.

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It really does.

334
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But that the federal government should stay out of people's lives.

335
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And that is essentially how the constitution was written.

336
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So there are many, many ways that we can provide health care for those that don't have it.

337
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And still stay within the boundaries of the original rules.

338
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And of course, it's got to be a huge transition period.

339
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And Dr. Ron's point.

340
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I just got a call on Dr. Ron.

341
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I can't call him Dr. Paul.

342
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
His point is that if we close all of these foreign bases that we have pulled the troops out of other

343
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
countries, we will have hundreds of billions of dollars to do this with to make this transition

344
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
possible and really set some goals for us to getting back to the basics of the foundation

345
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
of the country.

346
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And the idea that I can choose as to how I want to live my life is good.

347
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
No Department of Education.

348
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Again, what is the benefit of the Department of Education?

349
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What are they really doing?

350
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Do you agree with everything?

351
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Do you have kids?

352
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Have you ever had kids in public school in the States?

353
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I have.

354
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I got some to say about that.

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I understand he opposes the current military actions, but I think he would also have opposed

356
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
US support of World War II.

357
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
No, this is what your misunderstanding.

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He's not against going to war.

359
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He, quite clearly states, we are illegally at war.

360
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If you want to go to war, you have to declare war.

361
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Congress has the right to declare war.

362
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And then you point out your enemy and you go kick his ass and you come back.

363
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And there's got to be a lot of good reasons in that process.

364
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So this war is on an undefined enemy, namely terror.

365
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Well, that could be just the terror you witnessed on a rollercoaster.

366
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So there's no clearly defined enemy.

367
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Believe me, no one is saying it's the war on radical Islamists.

368
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
No, it's the war against terror because that's an undefined enemy.

369
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This can go on forever.

370
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You can be terrorized all the time.

371
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That part is working quite well, actually.

372
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So we have that.

373
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And then the fact that there was no congressional declaration of war.

374
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So the president basically assumed all of these powers.

375
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Patriot act, go and read it.

376
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And he declared war on terror.

377
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And we all followed its illegal and an unconstitutional war.

378
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I believe we actually declared war through government, through Congress, for World War II.

379
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If not, then please correctly.

380
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But I would be quite surprised if it didn't work in the proper manner.

381
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So that's really what it is.

382
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I think it would be important just to read through.

383
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's a very short document, this constitution.

384
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It really is.

385
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And that's where his stance comes from.

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And it's a real American thing.

387
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And I've just gone back and re-read it a couple times over the past week or so.

388
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And like, yeah, yeah, you know, if the country were actually run like this,

389
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
it would be really freaking awesome.

390
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And we do away with a lot of the shit that we're in right now.

391
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
All right, back to some bubblegum for your brain.

392
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Hi guys, it's Matt from Game's Weasel here on this week's show.

393
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We're reviewing Ratatouille on the week.

394
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Also the legend of Zelda, Phantom Outglass for the DS.

395
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We've got a development diary of Assassin's Creed.

396
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And you can win over £100 of goodies, courtesy of me.

397
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
All that against Weasel.beteepotshow.com.

398
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Show Matt Coddle.

399
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Thank you very much.

400
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Hey, some fantastic news.

401
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I think by the time you hear this show,

402
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
it will be official news.

403
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So doing it now, kind of breaking the NDA,

404
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
but I think I can live with the danger of it.

405
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Nokia is announcing a brand new internet tablet today.

406
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The N800 and 10.

407
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And so they're doing it at this swanky party in San Francisco.

408
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So I guess what is it?

409
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
9 a.m. San Francisco Time is the one.

410
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So if you hear this show before 9 a.m. San Francisco Time,

411
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
you didn't hear it, okay?

412
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Obviously, it's the next generation of internet tablet

413
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
beyond the N800.

414
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I think it'll be available sometime in November.

415
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This thing looks awesome.

416
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The main change is that now has a slide out keyboard.

417
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
This was actually rumored.

418
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I think I saw a picture on and gadget or one of those geeky blogs.

419
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And I think it actually was the correct image of the new device.

420
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The Nokia is doing some other interesting things.

421
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Another story.

422
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
They may even be announcing that today that they're coming out

423
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
with a tactile touch screen for a new device.

424
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So when you touch the screen,

425
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
it actually gives you some form of tactile i.e. feedback.

426
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You can feel on your finger.

427
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So you know that you're hitting the keys properly.

428
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I personally really like a physical keyboard myself.

429
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But I'm pretty excited about that.

430
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And of course, I'm already begging the candy man to hook me up.

431
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'll happily buy it.

432
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But if I can get it through him faster, that's all the better.

433
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Adam, any moose and orange bell telephone.

434
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I want to say thank you for everything you've done so far.

435
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
We're talking about Ron Paul and the other Republican candidates.

436
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm actually registered as a libertarian.

437
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So I can't vote in this primary.

438
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But right now, I'm looking at the Charlie 672.

439
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And I'm just leaning from year to year.

440
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Just listening to you talk about Ron Paul and how you believe in him.

441
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And you know what?

442
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's firmly to just research.

443
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It sounds from what I've heard on your show that I'm actually one of those forms.

444
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So you're already changing minds and sparring interest.

445
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Wait for him?

446
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yeah.

447
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Wait for him?

448
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'll talk to you.

449
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You're fucking big character.

450
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Adam Curry.

451
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Love you.

452
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I mean it.

453
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Ah yes.

454
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah.

455
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And look, this isn't a awakening for me.

456
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
People who are writing in sending emails, sending voice mail saying,

457
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
you've changed.

458
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What's going on?

459
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I feel pretty alive actually.

460
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I feel pretty vibrant.

461
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Finally, there's someone I can stand behind and say, you know,

462
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
it's not about these individual issues.

463
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's going back.

464
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The guy stands for something.

465
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Let freedom ring.

466
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
He stands for the Constitution of the United States.

467
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And look at all of the debates.

468
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Not a single candidate can re-but this guy's argument.

469
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You know, he just takes over the stage.

470
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's a 70 to 72 year old guy.

471
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You know, that's if there's anything wrong with Ron Paul is like,

472
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
you know, another old guy in the White House.

473
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You know,

474
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
although I know, you know,

475
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Bill Shattner's also 71 or 72.

476
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So you know, you can be pretty vibrant 70 year old.

477
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But it's, you know, he's not out there running on,

478
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
on little issues or big issues on issues individually.

479
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
He's out there on a platform.

480
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And the platform is one of the most powerful ones ever written.

481
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The United States was built upon this platform.

482
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And all he's saying is, let's return to the basic routes here.

483
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Because we got a little bit out of control.

484
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
She'd like this happens all the time that happens in all kinds of

485
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
organizations and companies.

486
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And, you know, of course, countries.

487
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And I think it's time for a reboot.

488
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And I think that's the message that is coming through.

489
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And it's coming through to young people.

490
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Young people online.

491
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You can vote when you're 18.

492
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
My daughter is in, you know, in shit.

493
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
My daughter will be able to vote in the upcoming elections.

494
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Can you believe that?

495
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
She does no shit about anything.

496
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yes, she's in her teenage moronic stage.

497
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But now, you know, so I think what's happening is her peers are catching on.

498
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
They're reading about this thing called the constitution.

499
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You know, they're reading about, you know,

500
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
they're just reading some different messages.

501
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's catching on, you know.

502
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So we could be very surprised by what happens if we get young people out there

503
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and voting.

504
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
They certainly seem very motivated online.

505
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Of course, it's a big step from behind that your Facebook account to the,

506
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
to the polling booth.

507
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I have it not everybody thinks he's going to make it.

508
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Hey, I'm curious.

509
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Nick Jackson from the Bay Area.

510
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I just wanted to call in with a little bit of stuff about the

511
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Ron Paul.

512
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I got to talk about.

513
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I think there are a couple of issues with Ron Paul becoming president,

514
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
not the guy himself, but him ever becoming president.

515
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I just, it sucks.

516
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But I honestly, I know I'm some skeptical man,

517
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
but I don't think it can happen.

518
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And there's a few reasons why.

519
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Because when you look on the internet, he's actually,

520
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I've heard from a few sources that he,

521
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
that he is one of the most talked about and read about,

522
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
discuss subject in the blogosphere this whole year,

523
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
which is pretty amazing.

524
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So I mean, it shows the popularity of the sky.

525
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But then when you look at polls and stuff,

526
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
the guy and he's tramming behind, he's often all the way

527
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
in last place amongst the Republican.

528
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And let me just say something about polls.

529
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Who cares?

530
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Polls are samples taken by commercial companies.

531
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The outcomes are always manipulated.

532
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
In some polls, he's actually done quite well

533
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
and the polls have been hidden.

534
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
The polls are just as accurate as,

535
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I don't know, as television ratings, I guess.

536
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And by the way, how accurate is our voting system?

537
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Now, I think it's more about the ideas.

538
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
If we can all start thinking more like this,

539
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
you know, Ron Paul doesn't have to become president,

540
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
but just thinking about the constitution

541
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and calling our Congress on these issues,

542
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
time and time and time again,

543
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
which of course is the real way to change anything.

544
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You know, it is a democratic republic.

545
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The whole point is, I use your congressmen

546
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
or congresswoman to make change.

547
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I think we're perfectly capable of that.

548
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
We're just starting to flex these muscles online.

549
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And people are just starting to wake up

550
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
to this very clear message,

551
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
which is, I think, just a great platform.

552
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Let me see.

553
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Add one more about another website you want to check out.

554
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
This is more about the financial side of the story

555
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
about the federal reserve and IRS and income taxes,

556
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
which is all interesting by itself.

557
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But to me, more important is war and killing people

558
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and stopping that insanity.

559
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Hey, Adam, this is Tracy and San Diego.

560
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm a new caller following the Ron Paul news,

561
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
like a shark after blood.

562
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Anyways, I listened to a couple of your podcasts

563
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and they're great.

564
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I hope you're able to handle the massive traffic

565
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
for Ron Paul, who are getting into power.

566
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Anyways, since you and your dudes are pretty savvy

567
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and after the US constitution,

568
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'd like to recommend you look into goldmoney.com.

569
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's a perfect bridge between our fiat monetary system

570
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and a gold-based monetary system,

571
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and actually hold a lot of gold right there in London.

572
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Anyway, I don't curse, so go curate yourself.

573
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Go ahead, laugh at that.

574
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Alright, let's backslash on all this stuff right now.

575
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Let's get back to, let me think.

576
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What can we talk about?

577
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Oh, of course I know.

578
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
If you have nothing left to talk about,

579
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
there's always pussy.

580
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Cats, a chorus line, laymates,

581
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and now a new light shines on Broadway.

582
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Look at me.

583
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Think of me naked.

584
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
The Seattle Gazette Review calls it the feels warm

585
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and also good musical of the year.

586
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The body may be failing.

587
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But pussy's still on my mind.

588
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You can feel the heat before the curtain's part,

589
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
says the Okanogan Free Quest.

590
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Oh, I love you don't it truth.

591
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If you're a douche, this shows for you,

592
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Barney Finkel, the Evanston Day.

593
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I miss your pussy.

594
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's sad for truth.

595
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I miss your pussy,

596
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
but I can't say I miss you.

597
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Nominated for a Tony Award in the category of loose game musical.

598
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000

White pussy black pussy red pussy yellow pussy

600
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Maybe there's even some kind of green pussy.

601
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Cosific coast hell way presents.

602
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Pussy the musical and audio book.

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Only a pussy the musical.potcho.com.

604
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Everybody comes from there.

605
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah, well there you go.

606
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It is, I guess pod shows answer to high school musical too.

607
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm so proud of the work we do.

608
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That's right, saving the world.

609
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
One crack at a time.

610
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Nothing like a little bit of monk to wake you up

611
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
with it makes the world go round.

612
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
There's something great about this old world.

613
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Oh yeah.

614
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The whole earth is full of every type of girl.

615
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Short and tall, large and small.

616
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Quiet and loud, nervous and proud.

617
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Everywhere he goes, made it here.

618
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
One thing is awfully clear.

619
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Big pussy little pussy hair,

620
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000

Maybe there's even some kind of green pussy.

623
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I could go on the days about that little pubic mound.

624
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Cos the world's made up of all kinds of pussy.

625
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Cos he sure makes the world go round.

626
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Yeah.

627
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah.

628
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah.

629
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
In every city and every town.

630
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Oh yeah.

631
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
There's something I want to show you.

632
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
When you are around.

633
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You don't know if you're in slow and just stop instead.

634
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
All the way in.

635
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
From now you down here.

636
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I got an interior.

637
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's all more than clear.

638
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Big pussy little pussy hair,

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Maybe there's even some kind of green pussy.

642
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I could go on the days about that little pubic mound.

643
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Cos the world's made up of all kinds of pussy.

644
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Same pussy.

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah.

648
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
There is France, Bangladesh, India.

649
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
New York, Lisbon and Berlin.

650
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
London, Melbourne, Mexico City.

651
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah.

652
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Let's go to Tokyo and try to get out of here.

653
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
My heart is overwhelmed with the joy that I have found.

654
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Cos the world's made up of all kinds of pussy.

655
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I say make the world go round.

656
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
From pussy the musical.

657
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You can find it at pussythemusical.potcho.com.

658
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Big pussy little pussy hair,

659
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
pussy sweaty pussy loose pussy tight pussy oh yeah.

660
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I got to tell you.

661
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I find it highly appropriate.

662
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
This topic because it feels to me a bit like we've all become big pussy's.

663
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,000
We sit around on the internet and we bitch and we mone and we complain and we get into groups and we bitch and we mone and complain some more.

664
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And it's time to do something.

665
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Let's get to work.

666
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Let's stick our hands out.

667
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Let's do something.

668
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm going to do it.

669
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm off the London.

670
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Do something.

671
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I think.

672
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Suzanne Vega is definitely doing it.

673
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
She's caught onto the podcast music vibe.

674
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
She is just released a track on the podcast music network.

675
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
A link of course in the show.

676
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's a daily source code.com.

677
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
If it's right in with a theme today.

678
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It is the pornography's dream.

679
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
The lovely Suzanne Vega.

680
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
She's a pornographer's dream.

681
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
He said, I knew what he meant.

682
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But it made me imagine what kind of a dream he would have.

683
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That hadn't been spent.

684
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
What he still dream of a fire.

685
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
The flash up on high what he saw.

686
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So much of.

687
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Wouldn't he dream of the thing that he never could quite.

688
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Get the touch of that of his hands over his head.

689
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Out of his reach.

690
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Under his real life.

691
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
He didn't know me.

692
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Covered and sick.

693
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Dreaming of what he might be.

694
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
He made his hands over his head.

695
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Out of his reach.

696
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Under his real life.

697
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
He made his hands over his head.

698
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Dreaming of what he saw.

699
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
He made his hands over his head.

700
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Pretty page, he's still the rage with her voice.

701
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And lover.

702
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
She turns to tease the camera and pleas-o-scat.

703
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
We let her lose to love

704
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Watch your shoulder for soul

705
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We let pleasure

706
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
If what she reveals and what she can see as is the key

707
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
To our pleasure and our lives

708
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
We're our help

709
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Out of our reach

710
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Under Chris real life

711
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Dreaming about what we need

712
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Out of our reach

713
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Over our hands

714
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Out of our reach

715
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Under Chris real life

716
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Dreaming about what we need

717
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Dreaming about what we need

718
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Under Chris real life

719
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Dreaming about what we need

720
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Under Chris real life

721
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Dreaming about what we need

722
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Under Chris real life

723
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Suzanne Vega

724
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Poor Niagara First Dream

725
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Munching on a bit of bacon here

726
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I lovely wife just came upstairs

727
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Had bacon and eggs for me on perfectly toasted English muffins

728
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
A little to realize that I just ate a huge breakfast before doing the show

729
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Ah, that's so horrible

730
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm munching on a piece of bacon

731
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Gah pork needs him

732
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
All right

733
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I had this whole train of thought

734
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
That is not completely gone

735
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
That doesn't matter

736
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Okay, no show tomorrow

737
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Definitely on for football Friday

738
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Can't wait to talk to you guys

739
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Maybe we'll have Ron Paul on

740
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
We'll see what happens

741
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Hey, enjoy your freedom, William

742
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Another poncho podcast
