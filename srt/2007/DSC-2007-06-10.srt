00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You said you'd meet me now it's harder to do

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I know I'm hiding but I'm still on you

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And I get to fact it talking to you

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I tell my family and you may sit around

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not in a jealous piece, I'm not looking like a clown

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think of you every night and day

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is my one, I can't think of my brother

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I guess myself from the middle

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Can I break free from the things that you do

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I want to walk, but I got back to you

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's why I ain't myself, but I ain't you

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm not looking like a clown

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But I'm dreaming about the love I knew of you

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm only in vain, I'll be happy with you

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But you can't keep me right

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You just don't know what you was missing this night

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I want to see you play, you said, but get it just goodbye

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I think of you every night and day

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is my one, I can't think of my brother

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I guess myself from the middle

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Can I break free from the things that you do

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want to walk, but I'm only in vain, I'll be happy with you

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's why I ain't myself, but I ain't you

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm thinking of you every night and day

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,400
Keeps up my heart, and it's a part of the way, yeah, yeah, yeah

33
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:49,400
I sell for loving you, and bring free from the things that you do

34
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:57,400
I wanna walk, but I run back to you, that's why I hear myself from loving you

35
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:17,400
I ain't no better way to kick off a brand new week

36
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,480
Brand new week of the Charlie Hey everybody, hi, I'm Bill and did you sure start episode number six one six

37
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:30,520
Joan Jett and the Black Hearts clearly follows the golden rule meaning if I have a golden record of the artist

38
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,280
I can play the song on my podcast. It's only fair

39
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,720
I think I've done my part of the equation on it's in

40
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:48,440
I hate myself for loving you

41
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,400
Joan, you don't need Joan, you don't need Joan, you don't need Joan, I wonder how she's doing

42
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,800
She's just on a picture not too long, I look pretty good

43
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,720
Everybody how you doing, this is a whole week coming to you from the Curri condo in San Francisco in

44
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,040
No Cal, it's of course it's Sunday night, it's Monday more more eastwards

45
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,600
So it's already Monday morning, by the time the UK is up and of course down under it

46
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,800
Australia, we know that till you already celebrating Wednesday afternoon

47
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,720
But Sunday night for me late, time to to catch up a little bit on what happened over the weekend

48
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,240
Of course, I still spend most of Friday in New York

49
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,840
And yeah, I just I just got done watching the

50
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Season finale of the sopranos

51
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,920
Much, much, much, much hyped

52
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,280
Yeah, this was supposed to be the hour of television that everybody was going to watch tonight in America

53
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,440
And I'm sure everybody did watch and let me tell you because you know traveling back and forth between the UK and

54
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,200
New York and San Francisco I really haven't had time to catch you know to really follow along with the sopranos

55
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,200
For some reason they're on a delay, I think they're on delayed schedule on sky or whatever

56
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,400
But I can never figure it out, I set some of those you know like a record the whole series and I wound up

57
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,280
Recording all of last year's series or the series five or whatever it is

58
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Now luckily Comcast here in in the condo has then on demand service, which is where they call it the

59
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't know if they even call it the catch-up service, but it's on demand

60
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,240
So I was able to catch up during yesterday and today I watched

61
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,120
Seven episodes of the sopranos back to back because I wanted to be able to be completely up to speed with the whole story

62
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,600
For the finale this evening. I saw I watched four episodes yesterday

63
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,080
I were just I was a three or four that I watched today

64
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,640
Yeah, so it was almost like like this massive massive movie that I watched a big big mob movie

65
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:52,920
Which was only interrupted every 60 minutes by the necessity for me to find the next episode and for a quick bathroom break

66
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,400
And so I was ready for it ready for the big season finale this evening

67
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,600
I don't know if you saw it or not

68
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,400
What kind of ending was that it was like the most disappointing thing I've ever seen in my life

69
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,560
I'm sorry if you're in the UK

70
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,520
You know you should turn it off now or skip ahead if wherever you are if you haven't seen the

71
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,480
The ending spoiler alert here

72
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,800
It was that I mean or to speak with the sopranos the fuck was that

73
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,640
I mean you want to end the gangster movie you know you

74
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
You want to you want to be something like this

75
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,440
That's what you want say hello to my little friend

76
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,160
I don't know man. I think what they just trying to leave room for uh for you know to come back anyway

77
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,480
And next season. I don't know it was completely unsatisfying to me. I

78
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,480
I really didn't do much much else this weekend although I have been looking out the window. It's I'll see if I can take a picture of that

79
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
y'all on the on the

80
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,560
You know in the upper 20 floors on uh in this building here the curry condo and I have a 180 degree view

81
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,680
So I have a view of the bay the bay bridge and of course the tower of death which by the way

82
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,520
I now actually have to

83
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,360
Squat down to be able to see the top of this thing through my window which is a ceiling to floor window

84
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,280
This is out it is literally the towering in front of I was been built next to the condo

85
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:29,000
On the other side I can see a straight down. I guess that's the moscone center which I never really realized because I see this huge

86
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,600
Apple logo. I believe it's the worldwide developers conference

87
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,360
That is taking place. I guess this week and so there's lots of people in town have been receiving emails from people

88
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,760
Who know I'm in town and want to hook up and so it's gonna be a pretty busy week. That's for sure and

89
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,840
I believe they're not once again. It seems like that just might be a Los Angeles trip

90
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Got to go to show biz town

91
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,760
So I'm hoping to be able to hook up with with a couple of people

92
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,840
While they're here and I wonder if there's anything exciting going on at the

93
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,640
Is there a Steve Jobs keynote? Is there something planned or not? You know, I should actually check that

94
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Usually apples pretty good about

95
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,680
We just say so you don't have to do it at home. I'll do this for you apple.com

96
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,720

97
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Anything about to

Introducing iTunes Plus once the do ads. Yeah, man if you've seen the iPhone and

99
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
I gotta tell you

100
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,360
Even though I've been a windows user fork or I keep what isn't now the better part of a year

101
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,560
I'm still at heart. I'm a I'm a Mac fanboy. No doubt about it

102
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,720
Here we go. WWDC 07 June 11th 15th San Francisco Explore new highlights

103
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,320
Excuse me unwind from Angie B brought you by Tylenol PM

104
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,720
You know, did I am I like completely stupid or am I just now figuring out that the PM

105
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,920
In Tylenol PM doesn't actually stand for post Meridian like you know like like evening time like sleepy time

106
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,680
I think I finally figured out it stands for something else than that

107
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,040
And I'm not kidding you. It really took me a long time to figure this one out

108
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,160
The best laid plans

109
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,320
Sell them become the desired outcome in a perfect world of business

110
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Alex controls every situation

111
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:27,480
But when agreements fall to pieces and associates are winding up dead and new world emerges and the bitch within

112
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,320
I'm new life to complete the final plays of the game

113
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:40,360
Relying on the pure powers of sexual persuasion the rules have changed and the lines are crossed between business and the art of

114
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,960
Sex and the realities of bitchiness from the imagination of Terry Woodard

115
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,960
ASB the art of sex and bitchiness

116
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:57,560
We're nothing is safe and the easiest way to be friend of foe is absolute sexual enticement

117
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:04,840
Coming exclusively to pod show this summer the art of sex and bitchiness the erotic murder mystery

118
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,680
That will make you second guess who you get into bed with

119
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,200
I can't wait for that a lot of these a lot of these audio novels are just so awesome

120
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,000
There was another one. I'm sending these all to Mark Yoshimo to name cough

121
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,720
Because although it's not officially announced yet. We're coming out with some very cool

122
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,960
Podshow press

123
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:30,440
That's all I'm gonna say about it, but this format and this is a format that is very very specific to what we're doing

124
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,640
It is not all like audio books like audible by the way

125
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,280
Autable who have closed down their pay for pod casting service. Gee guys that was a great one

126
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,960
I'm not forget Doncats that you tried to weasel me into that trying to endorse that

127
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,160
So that didn't pan out

128
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,640
But this is you know it's it's this thing is it's exciting you know I'm I'm listening to these

129
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,800
Books and I'll listen to a chapter and only they're only released a chapter at a time and it's almost like sticking the needle in you know

130
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,200
Because what is a chapter like five minutes maybe ten minutes you know it's like I want more

131
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,760
I want more than you have to wait until the next episode and by the time the next episode comes you know you listen to that thing

132
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,200
You're hooked and then you're hooked to this whole thing and then of course you want the book

133
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,240
It's as very exciting to me. It's very much the same principle as the pod safe music network and I am loving it

134
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
I got a lot of email from people

135
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Telling me I was pretty stupid about saying that

136
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Let the sunshine in

137
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,440
It's from the soundtrack to hair not the Jesus Christ Superstar

138
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,760
Was that last Friday that I said that now that that wasn't indeed pretty stupid

139
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,480
But it came from the first gen iPod, you know, so what can you say?

140
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Friday before I left New York, let's see

141
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,240
Oh, yeah

142
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,040
So I had a nice well of course I did the show Friday morning

143
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,880
I was relatively early and then I had a lunch and this was really nice. I had a lunch with

144
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,600
Brenda Brenda was one of my mom's best friends who I remember

145
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,200
I think I must have been maybe six years old or something like that because they both grew up together

146
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
They they grew up in in Rhode Island

147
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:12,760
And they went to a barrington high school together and so I do remember one time going back visiting with my mom and

148
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
And I was playing with Brenda's daughter

149
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Sarah I believe and

150
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,120
I remember Brenda was hot. I can't even then I was looking at all the women and

151
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,480
And you know she was very kind she sent me a nice nice postcard on May 21st

152
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
It would have been my mom's birthday and

153
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,680
And so I was in New York I said you know what I'm gonna look her up because I'd always promised my mom would do that

154
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,480
And I did and I got a hold of her and she said well why don't you meet me Friday at noon at the Harvard club

155
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,240
Now the Harvard club is a a private club

156
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,480
And so I actually dressed accordingly no tie that I don't believe that's necessary anymore

157
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,840
As a part of the dress code

158
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,320
But I did have a I had a jacket on and it was weird Max. I you know

159
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,400
So she's same age my mom 68 and so I didn't know what to expect but

160
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Walk into the Harvard club and you know stunning platinum blonde beauty

161
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,040
with with the you know just exactly the type of

162
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:20,680
And you it she fit perfectly in the Harvard club absolutely fantastic very chic

163
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,160
Yeah, you know had kind of a little bit of that that Providence accent that my mom used to have

164
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,440
As you was trying to hide it, but you know you really can't take Providence out of the girl

165
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
And we had a great great lunch for

166
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,720
About about two and a half three hours and it was fantastic because she was able to tell me things

167
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,320
About my mom that I you know stories that I hadn't heard or you know just other sides of stories or

168
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Maybe even were telling something that I remember differently and I was able to do the same for her and we had a really really good time

169
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,640
And oh and and I remember you know, I was like you know this I was trying to fit the Harvard club and everything into it

170
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
Her first husband

171
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Was the family that started macy's

172
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,760
So that would explain the bling but it was it was really it was really

173
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,000
What's the word for I don't know I felt much much better after after after talking with it

174
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,920
I felt a yet a little bit more enlightened as we're coming up on the first

175
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,920
anniversary of my mom's passing on that July second

176
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,640
So and then just to make it complete a complete

177
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,880
Personal day on Friday ahead dinner with Steve leads

178
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,920
My buddy who I've known for how cricky what have I known Steve for 20 years now

179
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
He was the one that brought me to MTV

180
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,600
Steve of course works at a serious satellite radio

181
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,480
And so you know been in close contact with him throughout our contract with serious and

182
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:54,600
We met it. What is it uncle Uncle Nick's Greek restaurant on night Avenue between 50th and 51st

183
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,040
We sat outside between the fire escapes it was it that by itself was almost a very surprised moment

184
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,760
And we talked some industry shit and he had some pretty good ideas about some things and and some some folks who we could

185
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,920
Work with the pod show so that's stuff. I'll be working on this week here at HQ

186
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,960
Let me see a little ketchup here on some other email and then of course I flew

187
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,640
On Saturday morning. I flew with sales weasel Greg and I took the early morning jet blue flight

188
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
From JFK to San Francisco

189
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,880
I have to say besides the back pain which I just get because I get it back pain from sitting too long anywhere

190
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Even in my own plane

191
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,800
Jet blue's got something going for it. I've said that before and and I figured out what it is first of all

192
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:46,040
There is enough room and it took out one row of seats. So they only have 25 rows now and for those of you fly jet blue

193
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,560
There is a little bit more leg room from exit row 10 for or exit row 13 and exit row 10

194
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Forward. That's where there's a little bit more room

195
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,160
So the whole whole point was that we were gonna fly you know, I was gonna fly back with him

196
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,760
You know instead of flying two separate flights. I was booked on jet blue anyway

197
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,800
So so let's try and sit together, man, and we got to row 25 last seat by the lavatories next to a

198
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Lady and a baby on our lap

199
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,840
We were really expecting the worst, but it was not that bad the stank was okay

200
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,920
Well, you know, don't you just hate it when people will stand next to you in the aisle and you're the

201
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,600
Basically you're putting your their ass in your face. Oh my god

202
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,720
The baby was adorable though. All I did was a gurgle and smile throughout the entire trip

203
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,840
So happy about that, but what really makes Jeb Blue cool is

204
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:42,520
The live television and there is a distinct difference between you know 20 channels of movies

205
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,240
Like you get on virgin Atlantic now. That's great. I have to you know

206
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,240
I'll tell you that I really love their selection. They refresh it every single month. There's plenty of stuff to look at

207
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,720
But live television. Wow. That's a real time wester at the flight just goes by in no time because you know

208
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,320
You get hooked. We were watching the this was so this was so typical

209
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,360
It was the VH1 classic highway a top 20

210
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,400
Road song countdown and it was sponsored by Lexus and clearly I think what they did is

211
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Lexus said okay, we want to we want to advertise but you got to make up a show for us

212
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:24,520
Which you know, it happens all the time and and we do some of that too at Pod Show only with these guys came up with

213
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,840
The brought out Mark Goodman to host the show was it was kind of fun seeing Mark Goodman on the tube doing that

214
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,560
But the choice of videos man, so the the first one was what they have

215
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,880
Man Gregson kick my asset for God already but you know they had like

216
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,880
Steppenwolf born to be wild what was the first one though?

217
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah, it was all off because all of a sudden you got like rock set

218
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,800
It was all kinds of really you know pink Cadillac

219
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,440
Free way of love. I think and I know exactly how this works. You know of course VH1 being basically

220
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:06,360
The same company as MTV the same folks who work at MTV will sometimes produce on VH1

221
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,640
You know all they do is think okay, we got to highway songs

222
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,480
They don't really give a shit about an order

223
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,840
Which song is supposed to be number one? It's just okay. Let's just make sure we play videos that they either mentioned

224
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,760
Cars in the title you see cars in the video

225
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,160
And we were just guessing which one come next and it was it was a pretty fun list and before you knew what we were there

226
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,040
And I stayed indoors all day today as I said watching you know all that soprano stuff

227
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,320
So I'm ready for a full week. We kick it off tomorrow morning eight o'clock. I am so ready

228
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,000
But go to LA if I stay overnight. I might even try and catch the jersey boys again

229
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,080
You know the San Francisco cast is now in Los Angeles

230
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,320
Oh and homeless second where is it?

231
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,640
Alison Eric Bergen's mom you know Eric of course is is my buddy you hook me up with tickets to the show

232
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,800
He got a review man. This is the Los Angeles times

233
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,000
So you know I love the show and I thought Eric had a fantastic job and I love Eric even more now

234
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,280
That I know who his girlfriend is who of course is incredibly hot. She's also in the show

235
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,360
Now check this out. Let me just read you a little bit about what they said about Eric. This was fucking awesome

236
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,560
Here we go. This is the Los Angeles Times calendar section

237
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Ehh

238
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
An odd development

239
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,720
Why is that the one I'm supposed to say?

240
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:35,000
An odd development is that Eric Bergen who plays Bob Godeo the songwriting genius behind the four seasons and the band member who claims to be more comfortable

241
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,120
Working behind the scenes is the show's breakout star

242
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,240
Is charisma feeds off the spotlight and with this lanky good looks and vibrant intensity and fucking hot girlfriend

243
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,040
He tends to eclipse the others in the musical numbers which are choreographed by Sergio Trujillo

244
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,680
Trujillo Sergio to evoke the old sixties moves

245
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:03,080
That's pretty good man and it goes on and on actually to say here just as the four seasons

246
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,520
Probably wouldn't have made it out of Belleville New Jersey without the hitmaking of Godio

247
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,960
This version of the band almost certainly wouldn't have gotten much farther than Newark without the charm of Bergen

248
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,360
Who fills the void left by Jones is amiable though low wattage valley

249
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,080
Oh man what an endorsement congratulations Eric. I couldn't be more happy for you man

250
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,160
That is so cool. I'm telling you this guy you brought way dude. You're totally gonna do the Broadway version

251
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,640
I hope you do at least. I think you'd be killer without a doubt

252
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
The opening of the show you heard

253
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480
A nice promo from Jones yet

254
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,520
Now normally it wouldn't take away the magic of this and you know so you probably think wow that's a cool

255
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
John Jets and Adam

256
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
You know like a cool jingle

257
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,640
In reality

258
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,000
Do you remember when I for those of you who have been listening that long when I left the curry castle in Belgium

259
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
when we moved to the United Kingdom

260
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,320
I took the box now I've been slipping around a box of air checks of radio shows of

261
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,040
Basically cassettes and a couple of real-to-reels that is you know it's been my history and I sent it off to the official

262
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,440
My official biographer Tom Scrooting clog walked down under

263
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,840
And he's been digitizing old radio shows and stuff he's been you know just been going through this box

264
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,760
I thought the box was kind of empty but apparently he still has stuff and

265
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,800
He found something from me. Well, this is from I it's got to be 1989

266
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:41,240
Let me just play with that thing again. Hi. This is Jones yet from the black horse and you're listening to Adam Curry on z100

267
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
See that part I cut off

268
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,360
Hi, this is Jones yet from the black horse and you're listening to mad cap Adam Curry on z100

269
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,200
It sounds like it came from a cassette done it anyway

270
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,360
So Tom sends me something else. He sends me a picture of a video cassette

271
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Let me just see the subject of the email

272
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,360
Is a proof oh oh home on for some reason

273
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,160
Well, that's kind of weird

274
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,800
Google notebook didn't quite keep it the way I want here we go proof of your early programming skills he sends me a picture

275
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,440
I got even it's so I got a zoom in here. It's a it's a fantastic. It's a it's a Sony cassette

276
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,960
And he yeah, he literally scanned the cassette and it's great because you can even see I should put this up somewhere

277
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,840
You can even see on this picture that it puts scotch tape over those two plastic things

278
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,400
The edge of the cassette you know if you want to record protect it you'd have to click that out

279
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,480
And that was so typical. You know, it always just put tape on it so that we could re-record anyway

280
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,320
And it says on this cassette it says basic programs

281
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,000
in Vic 20 basic

282
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,920
Now the geeks out there will remember this if you're old enough now have you ever heard a modem

283
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,920
What a what a modem sounds like when when it's trying to connect I mean these days

284
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,640
It's it's almost like how many people still know what a record scratch sounds like yeah

285
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,680
My daughter has never heard an actual record scratch

286
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,120
I know how she ever heard a modem connect because uh, you know, it's all uh Wi-Fi and broadband

287
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,840
There's no more audible dialing through a phone line

288
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,600
But back in the day the way you know before uh well

289
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,720
When we couldn't afford floppy disks those really with these first consumer grade computers

290
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,480
So before the Commodore 64 you had the Commodore Vic 20

291
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
Victor India Charlie 20 and

292
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,840
It was basically a keyboard it had a little TV RF output you could the

293
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,800
Shove in big ROM modules and you could connect the cassette recorder to it so you could write your programs to the cassette tape

294
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,840
Which would basically save the program this was basic so it was you know it was like lines of well

295
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,880
It was lines of code only very very rudimentary stuff and you could also read in

296
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
That information

297
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,280
From a cassette and you could then use the program you could load the program and you could send these to friends and you could share them

298
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:11,800
In fact the BBC at one point had the BBC a corn computer very similar concept and they would actually broadcast these programs over the air

299
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,480
So you then record that signal just a regular FM station

300
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,920
You would you would record the single onto your cassette tape and then you'd put it into your deck of your computer

301
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,480
And you could load up the program and it was it was the

302
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:30,200
Met with the most it would think about how cool that would be if we could still do that today. It was massive massive bandwidth

303
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Massive multiple

304
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,760
You know like

305
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,560
You know it's like one stream and everyone caught it at the same time. It's a mine trip when you think about it

306
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
And so what Tom did

307
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,720
Is he of course he digitized the program so if you have a a Vic 20 laying around

308
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:56,440
And because I don't have mine anymore. I had no idea where that's gone. I wish I still had it because it would certainly be in my my collection

309
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,160
Then please load this program up and tell me what it does

310
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Here it is

311
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,240
Yeah, my yeah my ears hurt too. I have to admit that did kind of suck

312
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,160
Hey, I want you to give me a call. I could look forward to

313
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800

00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
I

315
00:26:51,560 --> 00:27:00,680
This is what it from glad it's cost. I want to make pot show suck less, but I can't I'm from another country. I have to wait

316
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,480
Help

317
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,720
Don't worry

318
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,680
You'll be able to help us suck less very soon. Hey a castmaster Mike sent me an email looks like

00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:18,920
Actually, I'll read it to you. Hi vid blaster version. Oh dot one six beta is now public just put a link on the form at vid blaster dot com

Thanks for all your help. I sincerely hope you continue helping me test all those versions to come

321
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,040
So this of course was to the close beta test if you're at all interested in

322
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,080
quick easy publishing a video

323
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,080
vlogging

324
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:39,720
Being able to use multiple cameras this thing is is awesome you can plug in you know two three four five as many

325
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,920
USB cameras as you want and you can switch between them

326
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,120
It'll actually switch the the devices use for audio as well so you can have you know

327
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,320
It do you know if you have a web cans with built-in mics you can load up video

328
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,400
Just you know

329
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,360
Maybe just something you shot and you want to do a quick intro to it. It's it's a phenomenal program and

330
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,640
It works out of the block out of the box with the pod show all you have to do is fill in your user name

331
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,800
Which is typically the email address you use to sign up and your password and your video will be uploaded

332
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,960
Automagically just like cast blaster does to check it out at vid blaster dot com it truly is very cool

333
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
Okay, let me see

334
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,280
I think I'm gonna leave it at that for for now of course not a hell of a lot going on

335
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,240
But this week will be

336
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,160
We're all the good stuff comes from and we'll be good to be back in the office as well, man

337
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,120
I haven't been here for it seems like ages. Of course. There was a lot of stuff

338
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,800
You know it's planning out coming back a while ago before the whole German thing happened

339
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,800
So it'll be again, I'm probably not gonna know half the people in the office. Oh, it's kind of scary

340
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,520
So the final track this will be on the pod safe music network sometime this week. This was a tip from from Steve leads

341
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
I'm not quite sure what the connection is or

342
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:03,960
Maybe it's his brother Harvey who's working this record, but anyway, there's a lot of people really really excited about it

343
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,640
Yeah, you got to wait for it. You're gonna like it

344
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
