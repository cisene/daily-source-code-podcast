00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I present Padshal's poet laureate Melvin P. LeBeth.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Roses are ready. My sweater is beige. For your domain name needs, you should go to this page. GoDaddy.com.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Alright, let's see. I've got everything set up now. I've got my brand new microphone plugged into my brand new mixer and the tube compressor. Everything just like Adam Curry.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So now I just need to, well, before I start podcasting my first show, I'm going to get some words of wisdom from Adam Curry, the pod father.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm just going to go straight to the middle of an episode and see what he has to say and just inspire me to put this together.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I think it, um, okay, so we should probably, alright, I got to think about this. You already here, I'm getting diarrhea of the mouth. Oh boy, I hope I can find all my receipts.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Maybe the DSC 578 will be better.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The 60 million dollars worth of airplane scrapped to my ass.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
in the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I like to think I'm flying to the future.

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm the hero of the song, the flame's dead, and the fire's gone.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
All this empty minutes and night alone.

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And we are the last and one.

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Everybody out there.

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Everybody out there.

16
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Everybody out there.

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Everybody out there.

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I just gotta go.

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you really care, you really care.

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm the hero of the song, the flame's dead, and the fire's gone.

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All this empty minutes and night alone.

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
All this empty minutes and night alone.

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I just gotta go.

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm the hero of the song, the flame's dead, and the fire's gone.

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All this empty minutes and night alone.

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
All this empty minutes and night alone.

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I just gotta go.

28
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you really care, you really care.

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm the hero of the song, the flame's dead, and the fire's gone.

30
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
All this empty minutes and night alone.

31
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Everybody out there, everybody out there.

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm just a god of love

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you really care, you really care

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
From the full head

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm just a god of love

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm just a god of love

37
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm just a god of love

38
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm just a god of love

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm just a god of love

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm just a god of love

41
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I've just got to go

42
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You can really care

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You can really care

44
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You can really care

45
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You can really care

46
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You can really care

47
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You can really care

48
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's a way to kick off a full bar Friday

49
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
In my hammer house

50
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Deflapper Fulin

51
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Straight from Napster to your ears

52
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Purchase for 99 cents

53
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I encourage you to go out and buy that

54
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh man

55
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I was just perusing

56
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I was looking for a song for something else

57
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And I came across Deflapper

58
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Actually it was one of those suggestions

59
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Other tracks you might want to

60
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I was looking for AC DC

61
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Believe it or not

62
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Do you know that AC DC is unfindable on iTunes

63
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And on Napster

64
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What's up with that

65
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I was looking for back and back

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
For a different reason

67
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And I came across this and like

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh man

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I played this record so many times

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In the 80s

71
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Geez

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think I was almost honorary fan club

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Presidents

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Deflapper

75
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Those guys are recording in Hilversum

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
In the visilord studios

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
For a long, long time

78
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
With the magic of mud lying I might add

79
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Fantastic

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Everybody is your food bar Friday

81
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It is daily source code

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Episode number 578

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The last one for this trip

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Out west in Northern California

85
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
From the Curry condo

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It is

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
A very early Friday morning

88
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It is late Thursday night

89
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It is early Friday morning

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It is a little bit foggy

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Which means it may not be that nice

92
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Tomorrow

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hopefully you are checking this out

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It is nice and sunny

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Where you are

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I know it is great in the UK today

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I call the ladies

98
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I am a Patricia sister

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Is over visiting with Patricia

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So they got like no time for me

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Five minutes of a phone call

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And I am sorry

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We are off somewhere else

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We are doing this

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We are doing that

107
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I came home

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Ron and I had this dinner

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
At the San Francisco home of Mike Moritz

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Mike Moritz is a senior partner

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It is a coia capital

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
One of the investors in pod show

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I guess he does this on a regular basis

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It is called a founders dinner

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There is a founders of companies

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That is a coia

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Invest in

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Where they are

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
First of all

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Dude has got a fucking awesome pad

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Here

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I am not quite sure what part of San Francisco

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It is a massive house

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
High up on the hill

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Like 280 degree view

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Everything from the Golden Gate

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
All the way downtown

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Really nice

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Nice pad

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But it was interesting

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let us see

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Jason Calicanas

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I did not get a chance to talk to him

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Ron and I were late

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Because unlike the other founders

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We were actually working

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And so we showed up around 6.30

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And just before dinner

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But sat next to a former employee of ours

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Phil Kaplan

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Better known as pud

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
To us

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He worked in the engineering department

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He was a web developer

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I think new ideas

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Company that Ron and I started in New York

147
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And took public

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And successfully sold in 1999

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And Philip of course went on to start

150
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
To start the website

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Fuck the company

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And then of course he wrote the book

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And then he started ad-bright

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And ad-bright is extremely successful

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And cool thing about Phil is

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's still Phil

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's exactly the same guy

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No difference whatsoever

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
See who else was

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Who was the name of the guy

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
He has a funky name

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I forgot it

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He's a Tesla

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The electric sports car company

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Is his

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And he just shot a rocket into space

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Or some shit like that

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I was interested in conversation

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Who else was there

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Sean Fanning

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Is that his name?

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Sean Fanning

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
From a bit torrent

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Didn't get a chance to talk to him

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Either unfortunately

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So you know

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It was just a room kind of full

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Like geeky nerdy guys

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And a food was excellent

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And then I rushed home

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because I had some stuff to do

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Some stuff to produce

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
As well as of course

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Bring you your favorite

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Food Bar Friday

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
For those of you who are new to the show

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Food Bar stands for fucked up

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Beyond a whole repair

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And so you know

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You know you can walk into your house

192
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And you know immediately

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Something is very very wrong

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Like almost like the air is different

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I walked in and like

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Whoa what's going on

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And I'm looking I couldn't find

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Anything wrong

199
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But then I saw it

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
There was

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Right on the countertop

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
In the kitchen

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
A Jack in the box

204
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Coke

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So you know like one of those

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Takeout

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Medium Cokes

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
With a straw

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
From Jack in the box

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Sitting right there

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm like holy shit

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This is weird

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I got it got creeped out

214
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
For a second

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Then I saw the Baker's rack

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Was actually moved about half a foot

217
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And then I figured it out

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That they'd come into fix

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The leaking blinds or whatever it is

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But man they could have done

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
They could have at least

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't know

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
They didn't even tell me they were doing that

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
No but freaky

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay it is

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Food Bar Friday means we've got a lot of

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The standard stuff that we're going to be doing

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let me just see

229
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
If there's anything I want to talk about

230
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Right off the bat

231
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh yes this is really

232
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This is quite important actually

233
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yesterday

234
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I kind of made a faux pub

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I played you a clip of this

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Robert Newman

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It was sent to me by Neil Cocker

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And you said you've got to check out this

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Video or this

240
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The show that was on TV

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Comedy slash lecture

242
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Is the way Neil described it

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Robert Newman's history of oil

244
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And I

245
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I only listened to

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I just played the opening for you

247
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And listened to it

248
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And I said I'm bored already

249
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And I moved on

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But then later as the show was uploading

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I actually fired that up and looked at it

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Holy crap

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You must

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I repeat

255
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You must see this

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You will

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Love watching this

258
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Either

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
To the end of the tonight

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Or over the way

261
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I do it over the weekend

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Saturday or Sunday

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Just take 45 minutes

264
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And watch this

265
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The history of oil

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It is fascinating

267
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It seems like the guy has done his homework

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And what's beautiful about this

269
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Is his thesis or hypothesis

270
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Perhaps I should say

271
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Of why

272
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The United States invaded Iraq

273
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Is brilliant

274
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And it's something I have read about

275
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Before

276
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But I must say it kind of slipped away

277
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't want to spoil it for you

278
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But let me just give it to you

279
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In a nutshell

280
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
At a certain point

281
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
All of the OPEC countries

282
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Who have always traded

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oil has always been traded in dollars

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That was determined

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I believe in the early 70s

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Like 71

287
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
When OPEC said

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
OK

289
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The currency that you can buy

290
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And sell oil in

291
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Is US dollars

292
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Which of course

293
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, hold on a second

294
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
This is not a good thing

295
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I see that

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh shit

297
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's not good

298
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
When my desk is spinning around

299
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What is it?

300
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What's the name of that program?

301
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The virus can is

302
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Checking my desk

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Not good when you're recording

304
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
OK

305
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So that rule was set up in 71

306
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Which of course means that every country that wants to buy oil

307
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That needs oil

308
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, that's every single country in the world

309
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Has to buy dollars first

310
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So when you are buying dollars

311
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That props up the

312
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Currency

313
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Or it makes the currency valuable

314
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's a blind demand

315
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's real simple economic stuff

316
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But then around 2000

317
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And I can't remember which country started it

318
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Maybe it was

319
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Seria, Egypt

320
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I can't remember

321
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It doesn't matter

322
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Because eventually all OPEC countries

323
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Started to say

324
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hey, you know what?

325
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
We'd like to change our

326
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Dollar account into euros

327
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Because we're going to start doing this in euros

328
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Now what does that mean?

329
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And this is

330
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's so feasible

331
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But I think it's just brilliant

332
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Not to have even seen this

333
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That this guy

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Robert Newman caught onto it

335
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So if oil is now being traded in euros

336
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And you have a whole shitload of dollars

337
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What do you have to do?

338
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Exactly

339
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You've got to sell your dollars

340
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What does that do?

341
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Supplying demand?

342
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It devalues the dollar

343
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I must say

344
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Although there is no reason

345
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Ever to go to war

346
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And considering that almost every single war

347
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Has been for economic reasons

348
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And this is a part of this whole

349
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Stand-up that you have to see

350
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I mean it's taking out of context

351
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It just doesn't work

352
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But let's just say

353
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's just agree that most wars are started

354
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
For economic reasons

355
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It makes a hell of a lot of sense

356
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's been done in the past many many times

357
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's like hey, wait a minute

358
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
We've got to protect the value of our currency

359
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You know hey you guys

360
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You fuckers

361
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't be selling our dollars

362
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You've got to be buying our dollars

363
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Now you have to see this

364
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Because when he he does

365
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Comparisons to

366
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Silvatore Dolly

367
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And his infamous way of getting out of

368
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Paying for things

369
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's it is just phenomenal

370
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So you will you will not regret it

371
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Take a look at this

372
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Fantastic

373
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's Robert Newman's history of oil

374
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Of course a link

375
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
To that video in the show

376
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No

377
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh yes

378
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Hey hey hey

379
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Hi Amy

380
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Do you remember what we talked about

381
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Remember what we talked about earlier this week

382
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Amy

383
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Hello

384
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Hey Adam

385
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh yeah

386
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
When we talked earlier this week

387
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You said that we should try making the evening

388
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Assurcerizes a little sexier

389
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah, oh yeah

390
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So I thought we'd slip into something a little more comfortable

391
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Okay, I'm ready

392
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What do you say?

393
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What are you wearing?

394
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I mean like something really

395
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah

396
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't think I can pull the sex kit and thing off

397
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't know

398
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't know

399
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I felt like a moron

400
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No, you sound hot

401
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
They do a move laying on the ground

402
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So you can pretend sexy

403
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Okay, I'm here

404
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm ready to say

405
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Wait a minute

406
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
All right

407
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm ready

408
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm ready

409
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm ready

410
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Hold your arms so you can rest your head on them

411
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay

412
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Now lift the legs a few inches off the ground

413
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh

414
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't

415
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
We survived

416
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And beefy heels together

417
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Could you just help yourself

418
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And separate them about six inches

419
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And then repeat

420
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You want a quick and controlled

421
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay

422
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We're going for 20 seconds

423
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh crap

424
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Quick

425
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Don't forget to breathe

426
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Squeeze that butt

427
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh yeah I I I

428
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
This move is also working your legs

429
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Which you can help me feel

430
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh kidding Amy

431
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh yeah

432
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Keep breathing

433
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
All right

434
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Good job

435
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It might not have been a sexier's

436
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You can't say it

437
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But you can't say it and give it a try

438
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Until next time.

439
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh Amy, Amy, Amy, Amy.

440
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Thank you so much.

441
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I thought you pulled it off quite admirably there.

442
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Your sex kit and vibe.

443
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
See, you think that you can't pull it off, but you are so wrong.

444
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It really comes across well.

445
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I would encourage you to do that a little bit more.

446
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Now, of course, I don't have to ask Amy for naked pictures,

447
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
because we have a working relationship, and I'd never ask for that.

448
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But I've met her so many times, I guess I could imagine it.

449
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I did receive an exciting email.

450
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Remember, I played Caconee, Caconee for you on the show the other day,

451
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and checked out her page on the Podsake Music Network,

452
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and immediately requested a naked picture.

453
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Why is it?

454
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Why is it that no one will just really send me a real naked picture?

455
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yeah, it's funny.

456
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's like, you know, they'll send me pictures of them as a baby.

457
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And of course, Caconee wasn't really a naked picture.

458
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It was a photo montage of like a cartoon thing.

459
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I mean, when I finally, seriously,

460
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
you can get a naked picture out of doing this shit.

461
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Then we'll know that Pod casting is really derived.

462
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Hello.

463
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Calling all atoms.

464
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Well, the real atom curry, please stand up.

465
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I was my girlfriend.

466
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Hey, Adam and I.

467
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's Brittany Mason.

468
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And I've heard that you've been tutoring.

469
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Is it true?

470
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Is it really you?

471
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So what does it feel like to be impersonated?

472
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I mean, so famous that you are that someone is pretending to be you.

473
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So have you taken over yet?

474
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And how does it feel?

475
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah, this was pretty interesting.

476
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I got an email from a guy named Bill.

477
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It was some indist or non-descript Gmail email address yesterday.

478
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Apparently, for the past, I don't know how long,

479
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I presume longer than a week.

480
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
He's been signed up to Twitter.

481
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
This is the phenomenon.

482
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The phenomenon phenomenon.

483
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The phenomenon phenomenon.

484
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That exciting thing that people are talking about,

485
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
particularly in the United States,

486
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
where you send messages back and forth,

487
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
you can subscribe to someone's message stream.

488
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And you can also do it on your cell phone.

489
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And people are enjoying this.

490
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I, of course, signed up for this one first came out.

491
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I signed up not under Adam Curry,

492
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
but under one of my many online pseudonyms.

493
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And, you know, I tried it out.

494
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And I don't know.

495
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I was just like, I use SMS text messaging for important stuff.

496
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Not for stream of consciousness.

497
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's really important to me because when something comes in as a text message,

498
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
you know, it's someone who is approved by me,

499
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
because it actually doesn't ring or vibrate if it's an unknown,

500
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
unknown sender.

501
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You know, I'll know that this is important for me.

502
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And I don't want to be waiting through a whole box of messages,

503
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and just didn't interest me.

504
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So no problem.

505
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's okay.

506
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's not, you know, it's not for everybody.

507
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's just not for me.

508
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So this guy apparently had been out there.

509
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Twittering away as twitter.com slash Adam Curry.

510
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So obviously it seems like it's me.

511
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He's been doing a lot of direct messaging with with people.

512
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm God knows what he's what kind of relationship he's built up.

513
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But he emailed me and said, all right, dude.

514
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Well, I've been faking everybody out and pretending I was you.

515
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And here I want to hand you the keys to the car.

516
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So he gave me the password and login.

517
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And there were already 400 followers and say,

518
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
yeah, it was nice that he built up the audience.

519
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But it's pretty freaky when that happens when that, you know,

520
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I have no idea what he was saying to certain people or anybody who was

521
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
following and that's kind of freaky when that happens to be honest.

522
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But you know, it's happened on my space.

523
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I mean, there's lots of out of Curry my space pages and, you know,

524
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
whatever.

525
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You know, when when when the internet climb up on granddaddies

526
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
knee here for a second, when the internet's were just beginning.

527
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And I had MTV dot com.

528
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
There was a guy I wish I could find him.

529
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It was friday was from I can't remember which it was from a dot

530
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
EDU address.

531
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I really can't remember.

532
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It was I thought I think of Midwestern University.

533
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And he had set up a web page, which which replicated MTV dot com at the

534
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
time, which was pretty much an HTML page with a list of stuff with the

535
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
infamous infamous red bullets.

536
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The red dot gift.

537
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And I think we also had the green dot gift.

538
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
These were used quite widely on the internet at the time.

539
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
A very successful piece of piece of artwork.

540
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And he had set up Madam Furries MTV dot com.

541
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And it was the best parody I've ever seen.

542
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And oh, since there's been nothing like it.

543
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And I wonder if the guy is still around or if that page is still around.

544
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I think I've looked for it on the way back machine without any success.

545
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But, you know, it's I guess it's the sincerest form of flattery.

546
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The imitation or even hijacking for that matter.

547
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But you gotta be kind of careful with that shit.

548
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh, I just realized that since I,

549
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
oh, second to oh boy.

550
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh, this is not good.

551
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I don't have his jingle.

552
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You know, I had to reconfigure my whole cast blaster install so that it worked again.

553
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So I had to actually clear everything out.

554
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Something I've been dreading doing because I haven't loaded up with,

555
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't know, like 40 different elements.

556
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And, and I couldn't copy and paste the whole file over anyway.

557
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Long drawn out explanation is to why there's no comic strip blaster jingle.

558
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Hello Adam.

559
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I see that you have a new sponsor, which is a Tylenol PM or Tylenol PM.

560
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Tylenol PM, which is a cure to sleeplessness.

561
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But unfortunately, I can help you here mate.

562
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I myself can sleep under any conditions, totally any conditions.

563
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Also, if TV and radio are switched on.

564
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So I don't need it.

565
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Sorry, but I reckon that some people will find it very useful.

566
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Anyways, so on May the 4th,

567
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I am dropping by to London in vicinity of which you'll get for the virgins located.

568
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So maybe we could meet up there on May the 4th.

569
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
In the pot show UK office, for example.

570
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
What do you say Adam?

571
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You don't respond to textual emails, so I thought that voice feedback would get through.

572
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Or in it.

573
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:39,000
By the way, I hear in your latest podcasts that you have some pain, some problems, some issues.

574
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So let me say the obvious Adam.

575
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Be happy, Adam Kerry.

576
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Don't you dare to worry, because when you worry, you make your travel double or something.

577
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Your comic strip, comic strip.

578
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Very different type of sound there, CSB.

579
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What's going on, man?

580
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Sounded like you were driving with the top down cruising around.

581
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And wherever you live, Germany, I guess.

582
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Of course, dude, we'll try and hook it up.

583
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'll see if I can make myself available.

584
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I think I'm going to be in the UK in that week.

585
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh, man, everything is running together.

586
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
There's so much I got to do before we leave on vacation as well.

587
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Let me see how we do in time-wise.

588
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Okay.

589
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Dear Adam, says Dan Silver, my friend is running for Vice President of our law school.

590
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And it's been informed that we can only place endorsements on flyers if they are true and with consent.

591
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Unfortunately, you'll no longer be able to run on the motto in Dorsed by Scooter Libby.

592
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I was hoping that you would be willing to endorse Josh Locke for Rutgers,

593
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Camden Law School Vice President.

594
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Josh is a phenomenal person in a huge fan of old school MTV.

595
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
He's also a fan of yours for your role in pioneering podcasting.

596
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah, nice suck up bullshit.

597
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Josh will certainly bring a lot of enthusiasm to our school.

598
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Please let me know if we may list you as an endorser.

599
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I thought about this.

600
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And I thought, you know, that may not be a bad idea to do that because it's these kinds of guys that eventually, you know,

601
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
go on to great power may even become president.

602
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And you'll only want.

603
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So hi, this is Adam Curry.

604
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And I want to firmly endorse.

605
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What's his name?

606
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Josh Locke for Rutgers, Camden Law School Vice President.

607
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Not only is he a huge fan of old school MTV, but he's also a phenomenal person.

608
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And his package looks pretty good as well.

609
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So vote for Josh.

610
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Okay.

611
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm always willing to help.

612
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh, that's been saving this one all week for you guys.

613
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
This is Jessica Malat.

614
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm a 17 year old pop rock singer from Maryland.

615
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And the winner of the Los Angeles News Award for pop female singer songwriter of the year for two thousand.

616
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The tip of the set for two is some set for you.

617
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's just for the moment.

618
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
In June, I'll be flying to Nashville to record my first full-length pop rock beating.

619
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm so excited about it.

620
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Make sure to check out my website.

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000

Very cool.

625
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Alright.

626
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Let's keep it rolling on a footballer Friday with Mike Harwood.

627
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I love it.

628
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I love it.

629
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah.

630
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Good.

631
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I love you.

632
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
What do you think?

633
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Oh, yeah.

634
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000

So much.

824
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,120
Man, that's a way to close down a Charlie and finish up a week is that my car would

825
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,480
A little bit of moonshot on the Charlie five seven eight

826
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
It's Friday

827
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:53,480
Well, I've been talking about it all week, so of course it is almost logical that my final thought of the week has to do with the 15

828
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Seaman and one to a 14 semen and one seed woman who were captured in

829
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Apparently

830
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,120
The rock waters and held

831
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,520
In captivity for oh, I was like a

832
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
10 days or something like that

833
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,160
Anyway, so as we were talking about it as I was talking to you about it last night

834
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Of course this morning

835
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:23,160
Yesterday morning or truck. I don't know. I wish I lived in Australia than it would then you wouldn't matter what day I said

836
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,800
Iran's president Maumut Maumut. I'm a dinnerjad

837
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:36,280
Released the release release the 15 British sailors and Marines and I got to tell you a particularly after and please

838
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,880
You really have to see this video. That is my final thought of the week for you

839
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:46,280
As you must see this video that I talked about the history of oil because when you know that history and

840
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,120
You know, you can burn some from history believe it or not

841
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:56,280
I didn't quite if they'd only taught me this shit in history in school. I would have been fucking interested

842
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,680
crap. We never talked about stuff like this. So

843
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,520
But it takes me to another thought of how we should teach history anyway. Let me get through this part

844
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,400
Disguise I

845
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,600
Think did a he has a brilliant move. I think that

846
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,760
President Ahmadina Jad deserves the Nobel Peace Prize

847
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,720
Because if you look at the history particularly of Britain and Iran

848
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Forming on his Persia and

849
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,680
And this is a 100 more than a hundred year history

850
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,120
He had every reason and means and

851
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Motivation I would say

852
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:42,120
To have this end very very differently and he's telled about big middle finger and said fuck you

853
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,520
You know just showing you we're nice guys. You know we don't want you we're giving you a gift oh man

854
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,240
I was like making you say uncle three times and you know what

855
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,160
We live another day without nuclear war and so I think this guy is fantastic

856
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,520
I'm really really really like what he did there of course

857
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,640
I can't say that everything Iran does is fantastic because it's not like that but then again

858
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,240
Look at us here in the United States what are we doing

859
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,320
So anyway, I see that as a major move

860
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,760
I'm always looking for the olive branch and when someone hands it I'll like that

861
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,800
I got to say props and and actually I haven't really read around the blogosphere a lot

862
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,520
But I think that we everyone should be giving this guy props and that it's a very good move

863
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,200
I don't think he was afraid of anything. He just said hey, okay just so you know

864
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,560
You know you guys didn't do anything we worked this off and here you're your guys back and

865
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,880
Let's chill out a little bit

866
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
That was my general feeling

867
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,960
So maybe the final thought

868
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,200
Is if we're gonna teach our kids history why don't we start with what's in the paper today?

869
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:55,640
Open up the paper and then work backwards and show the kids what history really is and how you can learn from it

870
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,520
And why things today are happening because of events that took place over the past one hundred years

871
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,560
Please take that into consideration and let that be your final thought of the week

872
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,280
So it's

873
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,760
