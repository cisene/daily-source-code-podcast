00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For those of you who haven't experienced the Charlie well it's kind of like when you

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,480
have something important to tell your girlfriend and she says she has something important

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,400
to tell you but you convince her to let you go first and you tell her well I just need

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,160
a little space I don't think things are working out I think we should take a break then

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:28,440
she tells you she's pregnant yeah that's kind of what it's like now enjoy the DSC

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:35,560
548 in a world where TV networks movie studios and record labels still think they can

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,920
govern what you see in here one man has the power to return control of entertainment

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,880
to the masses and make big media corporations wet their tiny little pants from pod show

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:54,200
comb of the world's most dangerous new content comes the daily source code with Adam

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
it is dating source code episode five hundred and forty eight

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
coming to you from the newly revamped Adam's attic

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
on the third floor of the curry manner in the affluent suburb of Surrey

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
known as G-town west side

45
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
hey everybody how you doing welcome to Monday as I promised

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I do a show regardless even though everyone's kind of off today

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
there was enough enough material that's for sure

48
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
are you doing

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
okay first things first I'm not in San Francisco buying

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
yeah there was some some business that was interesting for me to

51
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
attend to in London town so if post-pone the trip I could

52
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
be leaving as early as tomorrow morning but more likely

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wednesday but either way I'll be bringing you a full-fledged

54
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Charlie's and happy to have you along for the ride

55
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
now even though I was home last night

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I missed a whole bunch of good shit on TV

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I missed top gear which of course is one of the three shows I

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
watched religiously here in the UK apparently

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
they tried to turn a a reliant into a space shuttle

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
luckily I have this thing on my my sky digital so it's been

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
recorded I can't wait to see what the show is about

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
why were we so busy

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
excuse me as you can tell it's still a little bit there

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
oh by the way comic strip blogger is now ill as well

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that's going around it's the nasty ass bug

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
you could whatever I have to laugh or whatever I inhale

67
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
really deeply then the flimp but you know what I know

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
anyway

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
we finally did it we cleared up the entire third floor the the

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
bad cave is now complete I got to tell you this place looks

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
fucking spectacular I haven't decided yet whether I want to take

72
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
pictures during the day or during the evening or maybe even both

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
you can definitely want to show you because I have you know

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
like four sections literally I've got the living room area I've got

75
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the desk area I've got the studio area of course with the

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
temporary console since the big mother load wouldn't fit

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
up the stairs then I have the flight sim area and then I have

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
bookcase keyboard guitars are kind of like a

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
music area if you will which is the more like a display

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and by the way I've now surrounded myself with all of my

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
favorite things which is nice you know it it's like

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
well is it's it's the ultimate boys attic is what it is

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm so so happy okay pictures coming I promise

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
speaking of of automobiles you know I'm a big fan of this

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Nokia 800 internet tablet some guys have put together this

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
a diagnostic program and I didn't know this but let me just go to

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
page here for a second you know how when you drive your car into

88
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
the shop particularly a more modern car in fact the car

89
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
will actually tell you it's time to go into the shop because

90
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
they have some you know little light or some warning or

91
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
perhaps like I'm BMW's you know first you see green lights

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
then yellow lights and red lights which I'm pretty much

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
convinces bullshit and it's just based upon time or

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
maybe mileage or whatever but you know so they get you to

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
enter into the garage into the workplace and they use

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
something very similar if you have an OBD to compliant

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
automobile and believe it or not most cars built after

98
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
1996 are you can use a scan tool device and connect

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
your Nokia 800 to your car via USB or in some cases via

100
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Bluetooth and I you've got to see this man so they've got

101
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
all kinds of of diagnostics let me see where they have

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
engine load ATP the hell is ATP must be some kind of

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
pressure RPM of course speed they've got it's it's beautiful

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
they've got all kind I don't know anything about about vehicle

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
diagnostics but how cool that be and the interface is

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
very realistic is just fucking beautiful it's amazing what's

107
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
being done he stays and this is done by this is because this

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
device is is basically open source people can build this

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
stuff and another thing came out a preview of a canola

110
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
if you read curry dot com then you'll see links to all this

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
stuff you'll see why I'm so excited because you know we all

112
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
spoke about from many years now we've been talking about

113
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
all of only we had an iPod the way we wanted it let me tell

114
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
you that time is here you can create the iPod of your dreams

115
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and in fact some people are there's new canola interface is

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
much better than the iPod interface and it understands

117
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
podcasts in a different way it's completely customizable now

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
of course there's lots of I would say the typical end user

119
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
won't may not be interested until all this stuff is really

120
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
short up and it comes all prepackaged on the device

121
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
but I guess that's kind of the the the tradeoff and maybe

122
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
it's kind of the agreement I'm like in the way this works so here

123
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
here you go open source world developers here's here's a device

124
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
here's the basics now you go and build some cool shit and we'll

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
support you I'm speaking is Nokia I guess and then when it's

126
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
when we've got some cool packages we'll really I guess release a new

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
device or an updated device so we're all kind of working

128
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
together and there's something about it that I'm I'm really

129
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
really digging I like it

130
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
prismalone

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
send me I got lots of links to post for you today man you send me a link to an

132
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
automatic toiler dispenser which looks like it's built out of

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
macano is that what it's called macano I think that's what that's what

134
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
we call it and like tinker tinker toys or whatever and it

135
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
folds it folds it cuts it slices it dices you got to see this thing

136
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
it's amazing

137
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
hey Adam this John from the Star's Hollow podcast and I know the

138
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
whole how do you take your toilet paper debate is long gone

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
but I just had a little moment that I thought share with you

140
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm recently reading a book by Douglas Coopland

141
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Copland I'm not sure I can say his name the book's called

142
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
J pod which is it's a really good book and on page 388 here's what I

143
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
came across John do asked what's a folder or a crumpler both

144
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
their technical terms used by the pulp and paper industry said

145
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Caitlin meaning toy that tissue manufacturers divide end users into two

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
categories people who crumple their paper and people who fold it

147
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
each is 50% of the market Mark said what about you breed crumpler

148
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
folder Bree said this is like the white versus black spy versus

149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
spy thing you're changing the subject I'm a folder obviously

150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
no I wouldn't have had you down as a crumpler surprise

151
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
to geeksq in any particular direction I asked Caitlin said I suspect

152
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
they're more likely to be folders so there you go Adam

153
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I know the whole question of what is the proper way to take your toilet

154
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
paper is long gone but apparently according to Douglas Coopland

155
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
geeks should be folders thanks a lot man

156
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
well according to the latest survey of the daily source code audience

157
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
79.3% of you out there are folders at least those of you who have

158
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
texted in the word folder or scruncher there was an odd

159
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
full jurors that came in but those obviously don't get counted like

160
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
three or four people sent that in thanks appreciated but it's a

161
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
wonka counted towards the final tally so yeah 79.3% right now

162
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
for for the folders you know thinking about it how come that automatic

163
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
paper toilet dispenser doesn't give you an option of

164
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
folding or scrunch maybe a little bit too tough for the robotics

165
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I guess but I got a agreement I think geeks are mainly folders

166
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
it just seems to be that way over the weekend actually this

167
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
happened last week news came out of the Netherlands and as you know

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I speak the language about podcasting and using license music

169
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
the NVPI is the national association of record publishers

170
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
so this would be basically the record companies who own the

171
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
masters and half of the rights if you want to include a song

172
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
in a podcast the other half of course being the performing rights

173
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
societies which in the Netherlands is the boomer now they previously

174
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
had already published a podcast license for a nominal fee

175
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
of course they said it was experimental because it's only part of the

176
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
equation it's the performance right I think that was

177
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
forget about how much that one was it was negligible but everyone

178
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
was kind of waiting for the publishers to come out with with their

179
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
part of the deal here

180
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm sorry I tried to have a folder's moment there but didn't work

181
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
okay so here it goes this is very interesting for a number of reasons

182
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
first of all as far as I know it is the first time a national

183
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
organization has sanctioned or even published a rate card

184
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
or fees for using license music in a podcast

185
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
per podcast non commercial 50 euros per month

186
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
now that's about about 55 between 55 and 60 bucks US

187
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
that is up to 10,000 downloads

188
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
if you have more than 10,000 downloads per month

189
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
of of your podcast regardless of how many episodes you make

190
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
you will pay another 25 euro per extra 10,000

191
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
so let's say you had just to make it simple 20,000 listeners

192
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
which is quite a lot actually I think by any standards

193
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
you would be paying 75 euros a month so say about 85 90 bucks a month

194
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
which of course you know is like a grand a grand a year

195
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
now if you are a commercial so if like me

196
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
it's 135 euros per month up to 10,000 downloads

197
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I haven't been able to find the additional but I'm just going to presume

198
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
it's an additional 135 per 10,000 after that

199
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
which brings you to a pretty hefty sum

200
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
now what's interesting about this is a it's an astronomical amount of money

201
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
it really is and I just don't understand how how they think anyone

202
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
yeah even the non commercial rates how can anyone afford that

203
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I mean you really got to be in love with it

204
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
but even for commercial podcasts

205
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
it's like you get punished the bigger your audience is the more you promote

206
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
the sale of their product the more you have to pay into it

207
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
because of course the way they're calculating this is saying well

208
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
you know it's a 10,000 people downloading so these are you know here's the amount of people

209
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
that are going to have the song for free and probably won't go buy it

210
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and then there's probably a portion of those who won't go buy the

211
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
buy the album it's like

212
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
you should be paying me 135 euros a month to play your fucking songs

213
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
so of course the the response is pretty much long live pod save music

214
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
but definitely definitely worth mentioning

215
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
along those lines i i certainly invite

216
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
the Dutch podcasters to participate

217
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
in something that a couple of podcasters seem to just kind of like organically sprouted up

218
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
although of course part of it is from a part of it being driven by a Mark Yoshimode

219
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,000
and i wasn't quite too sure about this at first but anyway it's called operation

220
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
bum rush the charts and here's the idea

221
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
um the thought here is to show the mainstream

222
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that podcasters really have their shit together and move product

223
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and the way um and this has been figured out the way to do this

224
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
is by playing one song and and getting the audience

225
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
to buy that song on one day to influence the iTunes chart

226
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and presumably the iTunes chart is pretty real and is not gameable

227
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
other than the gaming we're trying to do right now

228
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
um so uh a song has been chosen mine again by black lab

229
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and the reason for that as a black lab actually was a uh had a mainstream record deal

230
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
like i dropped and of course they're doing great in podcasters it doesn't really matter to me

231
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
which band it is i mean the whole idea of showing that we can actually make this happen

232
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
is a pretty cool idea

233
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
go to bum rush the charts dot podshow dot com bum rush the charts dot podshow dot com

234
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
you'll find uh all kinds of information um about uh you know

235
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
uh how you should put this together

236
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
make sure that uh your audience is only buying that track

237
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and on Mark's 22nd which i believe was chose specifically because there'd be no other competing

238
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
music being released on that day uh but i like this idea and i'm definitely going to participate

239
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
so um beyond the lookout for a lot of uh black lab airplay uh in the next couple of weeks

240
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
and uh and of course a lot of promoing of March 22nd March 22nd and you'll see uh i have the

241
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
little uh bum rush the the charts logo on curry dot com i'll put it in the show notes for today as well

242
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,000
it's a really cool idea and and i think it will uh look if we can make a song

243
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
a pod save song go up the charts by purchases and look you know

244
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
guys in the audience you know if you're if you're sending me a text message

245
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
saying whether you're a folder or scruncher it's probably costing about the same amount of money

246
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,440
particularly if you're calling from if you're texting from the states you know so it's one or two

247
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,800
text messages spend it on the black lab track and let's we'll make news with this there's no doubt

248
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,240
about it this this will be headlines and this will really show that we've got something to say

249
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,480
and that we've got an audience and we are powerful uh lots of other cool stuff going on

250
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
the network as well this weekend

251
00:19:41,960 --> 00:20:10,920
it.

252
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,320
Yeah, you gotta listen to that, man, that's awesome.

253
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,120
Chuck D has always had his head on straight,

254
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,760
which I think is nice, cool.

255
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,440
Hey, let's see.

256
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
So I'm really excited about the stuff that I'm doing in London.

257
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,280
Although I would also be kind of excited

258
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
to be in San Francisco.

259
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,440
I think the weather is probably beautiful right now.

260
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,680
It's not too nice here outside the manner.

261
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,960
Oh, also, I blanketed the entire manner now with Wi-Fi.

262
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
I finally got, I had another airport

263
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,880
which I'd left at the cottage

264
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,080
and the real estate agent had it.

265
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,840
So Patricia was kind enough to pick that up

266
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,680
for me.

267
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,560
And so now I've set up WDS, which is,

268
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,040
it's kind of like a long head for your airport, I'm just kidding.

269
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,000
So everything, you know, throughout the house,

270
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
no matter what base station you're on,

271
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,360
there's only one network curry manner.

272
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,480
It does actually slow down some of the throughput internally,

273
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,480
but, you know, it's not such a bad thing.

274
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,840
All, you know, considering the source of the ADSL

275
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,640
is not all that fast to start with,

276
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,960
but it's awesome.

277
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,720
So now, anywhere.

278
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,480
I haven't quite tried out the distance in the backyard,

279
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,440
but I think I'm gonna reach a pretty good distance,

280
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,560
which is the first time I think I've actually had

281
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,480
all areas of a home cupboard.

282
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,320
So I have my favorite bathroom where I fold in the morning.

283
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,160
That's where I use the web tablet, works perfect there.

284
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,280
Wait until you see my sitting area here upstairs

285
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,600
in the bed, it works everywhere.

286
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,040
Loving it.

287
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,760
I really want to talk to you guys about Trinity.

288
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,240
I've been thinking about the free Trinity project all weekend.

289
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,480
And I think I've made a fundamental mistake in my thinking.

290
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,840
And I also have a challenge if you're an engineer or a programmer.

291
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,000
Got your attention, didn't I?

292
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,840
I had him.

293
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,640
This is Mike, the kids' wife for a life podcast,

294
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,600
and I am here with my lovely wife, Chris.

295
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,600
No, no, Mike, Mike, Mike, that's not gonna work.

296
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,920
This is for Pod Show and Adam Curry's daily source code.

297
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,240
We have got to kick it up a notch.

298
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,800
Okay, what do you suggest?

299
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,440
Listen to this.

300
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,720
We're tired, we're stressed, we're parents.

301
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,560
And we're coming to Pod Show.

302
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,200
Please come and listen to our adventures

303
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,200
as we try to balance kids, marriage, work, and life.

304
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,960
You can find our show at kidswifeworklife.potshow.com.

305
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,640
Oh, welcome aboard guys.

306
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,480
It's kind of interesting that you should think that the daily source code is associated with disco bells.

307
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,880
But I appreciate the thought.

308
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,400
Hi, Adam.

309
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,760
I just thought it's that by and give a quick shout out to folders and thank him for sponsoring your program.

310
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,480
As I'm used as I was at your past drinking habit to the morning,

311
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,560
I couldn't get into it because I am a folder in every sense of the word.

312
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,000
I use an inexpensive capational maker and make a talk up of D-Caf in the morning

313
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,880
with a tablespoon of melted milk, a little bit of sweetener,

314
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,040
and some 2% frost and top of that.

315
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,880
Makes one heck of a cup of capational.

316
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,560
Oh, thanks.

317
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,240
Oh man, oh man, there's only one thing wrong with your recipe.

318
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,280
Do you, it should have, you should be using Splenda.

319
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,880
What kind of sweeten on you, sweetener?

320
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,480
Are you Splenda, man?

321
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,360
That's when you can really start to combine the gourmet flavors of

322
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,080
folders with the flavor blends of Splenda.

323
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,760
Oh, you gotta do that.

324
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,200
That's what we're Hawkins stuff.

325
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,280
If you have not checked out Marie Claire on the Pod Show network,

326
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
if you liked the Devil Worth's Prada,

327
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,200
if you think ugly Betty is funny,

328
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,920
well, until you see this show, first of all, it's short.

329
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,520
So it's not gonna bore you to tears.

330
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,760
Like that movie was long, and it was fun movie,

331
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,440
but it was basically, forget it, one of my saying here.

332
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,240
That was basically porn for women, right?

333
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,840
Whenever you have fashion magazines or fashion in general,

334
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,240
it's porn, Prada, Gucci, Fiorucci,

335
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,400
ugly Betty in its own way is also a version of porn,

336
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,680
and also the, I guess it's the aspirational aspect that

337
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,240
I too could make it into the world of female porn.

338
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,240
And you, you sitting in your car right now,

339
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,080
listening to serious stars 102.

340
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,960
Yes, you too could be in the world of porn.

341
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,320
You don't have to be beautiful anymore.

342
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,080
In fact, ugly is the new black.

343
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,920
Am I saying that right?

344
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,360
You guys can check out more daily source code,

345
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,520
uh, today's source code, a daily source code.com.

346
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,280
And of course, uh, more of the pod show.

347
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,000
And for those of you hanging around with me,

348
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,160
check out Marie Claire dot pod show dot com.

349
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,640
It truly is porn for women.

350
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,520
I kid you not.

351
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,640
Every three, every 30 seconds has a money shot.

352
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,600
A century and a half before the tragic events at Shadow Falls,

353
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,200
one exoters visions of the future will lead him

354
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,640
on a cross country journey to unlock the secrets

355
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,720
held inside his nightmares.

356
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,240
But what he finds behind destiny's door,

357
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,040
may be a darkness beyond his control.

358
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,440
From the mind of Mark Yuchimodo Nemkov comes the chilling

359
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,240
audiobook prequel, Shadow Falls,

360
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,920
Badlands, be part of the revelation at Shadow Falls dot pod show dot com.

361
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,080
How tricky is that, huh?

362
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,440
Waiting for season two of Shadow Falls,

363
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,400
the runaway audio drama hit on the pod show network.

364
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,120
Now check out the prequel, Badlands.

365
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,760
How awesome. Hey, what's up with the,

366
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,080
this done La Fontaine Guy who, of course,

367
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,040
has done a number of promos for me as well.

368
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,480
How can we always says this type of stuff?

369
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,160
How come Mark always has these promos?

370
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,640
Listen to this.

371
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,120
From the mind of Mark Yuchimodo Nemkov.

372
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,160
How come, I can only just,

373
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,600
how come we're just not honest about it?

374
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,840
How come it can't be from the ass of Mark Yuchimodo Nemkov?

375
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,320
He's so much more realistic.

376
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,400
While it's Monday, time to start

377
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,960
your week off right with an update on the old galtrin.

378
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:32,280
Okay, of course, the whole idea behind free trinity is to take my 1984 poo.

379
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:38,520
Baby poo colored Mercedes station wagon is a 300 turbo diesel running completely on

380
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,920
bio diesel. She's from 1984 as I said.

381
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,480
So she's had a few issues.

382
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,680
In fact, an update from Rosie, as you know, Rosie has been tasked with

383
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,400
keeping trinity running until she gets ready to go on the road.

384
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,680
Oh, this came in, was it the 16th, so Thursday or Friday?

385
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,200
Adam, as you know, I've been driving your car regularly.

386
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,400
Well, the brake warning like came on the other day.

387
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,000
Took it to the shop and they identified that front and rear brakes

388
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,760
brakes do need to be replaced.

389
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,280
Broder's pads and sensors, $585 total.

390
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,600
The car is pulled apart ready for repair now if you approve it.

391
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,720
Not let me know.

392
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,680
So hard to bring you another sad chapter in the trinity saga.

393
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,720
Actually, I'm not sad at all, Rosie. I'm glad all this stuff has happened

394
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,760
now because I think we've hit all the vital areas.

395
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,080
Let's see, we've got the fuel flow. That's where we've got the brand new transmission.

396
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,360
We got the brakes.

397
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,080
Other than that, Rosie says she's running great. A small rattling sound from the engine

398
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,880
which they identified as the air conditioning compressor.

399
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,400
Which is shot to hell.

400
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,600
They suggest cutting the line to it and that'll stop the rattle somehow.

401
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,720
Doesn't seem necessary at all to look into a pairing AC on her, man.

402
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,520
You know, I got to be honest.

403
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,360
This thing is costing me a fortune.

404
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,960
They got sunk like, you know, $6,000 into it.

405
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,480
It's time to get this bitch on the road.

406
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,320
Thanks, Rosie.

407
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Well, almost second. I have another thing here about what is this from Trinity.

408
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,760
Okay, I hold that for a second.

409
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,760
Okay, so I think I made a fundamental mistake here

410
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,400
and thinking that we would have some kind of relay race passing Trinity off from one person to the next

411
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,360
starting off on the west coast of the USA towards the east coast.

412
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,520
And then far beyond the borders of the US.

413
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:28,360
In fact, we have invites from all over the world, including Japan now, I think.

414
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,800
So here's the mistake I made.

415
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,160
You know, if you take, so let's say I live in San Francisco and like, yeah, I'll drive

416
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,200
for the first 100 miles.

417
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,320
How am I getting back?

418
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,080
And what if I have to drive 200 miles?

419
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,960
How am I getting back?

420
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,520
Because that's what that means that every single person that we have,

421
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,240
who's going to drive Trinity also has to have a ride back.

422
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,440
I think it's really complicating matters.

423
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,480
In fact, I have to be really, really honest with you.

424
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,760
I'm almost back full circle back to the idea that Doug Pilgrim had to

425
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,800
to bring his son out to the west coast and then drive Trinity across the USA.

426
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,960
Up to, uh, I was going to drive to Boston and stop it all these stops along the way.

427
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,160
I think that's probably going to be the best, uh, the best way to

428
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,960
to get her on her way because, you know, if she does break down, you know, who's

429
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,680
responsible, you know, somehow I'm going to pod shows going to have to get involved and do stuff.

430
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,560
There's a so many moving parts to the audio and video ideas that we want to get up.

431
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,720
I think it may be better to actually set it up or people who want to make a certain trip.

432
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,400
And have a way to get back to make the trip and stop along some, you know, a designated

433
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,720
route that we, uh, that we compile together.

434
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,880
This is just what I'm thinking today because it, it really, you know, is like a joke

435
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,480
sometimes, uh, I've seen done. I think my dad actually did this once and I thought it was pretty funny.

436
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,320
He was speaking at a conference and he said, you know, just so we can all cut a coin.

437
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,040
It won't just turn around and say hi to the person behind you. And of course, everyone

438
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,400
turns around and the person behind them is also turned around. So you're looking at their back, you know,

439
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,320
but that's kind of what this whole Trinity thing is turned into.

440
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,920
Now, I don't think that a week for West Coast to East Coast is enough.

441
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,120
I know you can do the trip probably in about three days.

442
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,040
I'm thinking it should maybe be a little bit longer because there's so many different places

443
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,520
that, you know, she should go and maybe we should look at people who have certain,

444
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,720
you know, who have certain, um, routes that they're going to do anyway

445
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,400
and wouldn't mind driving. And honestly, I think I'll spring for return airfare.

446
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,560
It sounds like a much, much better deal.

447
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,960
Okay, so I'm just kind of shooting from the hip here and thinking about it. Now, about the

448
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,520
technology side because that's what a lot of the energy seems to be about on the free Trinity

449
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,360
group at Google link in the show notes, of course, a daily source code.

450
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:03,640
You know, give an example. Here's prolific. Oh, I mean, uh, well, where are my manners?

451
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,960
For those of you who haven't experienced whoops, uh, hell is that? Oh, man.

452
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,000
Oh, the fuck Charlie. Well, the fuck that I do that for. How did that go wrong? Hold on.

453
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:31,640
Hi, let her. Here we go. Hi. Hi, I'm this prolific programmer here. I look at a Python

454
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:40,360
at my implementation based on your request of somebody in DSE. If I for seven regarding a Python

455
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:46,680
at an attempt to XML or PC translator, I will work on a get back on my own. Oh, I'll be dead.

456
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,640
Ah, prolific programming. You slay me, man. All right. So there's all kinds of geeky stuff going on.

457
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:59,720
And the problem is is you've got all these people who are very interested in helping out, but they

458
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:06,440
have no device to test it on. And of course, it's Linux. So, you know, it'll work with, you know,

459
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,280
with many similarities, but look, I'm a busy guy. I'm not a programmer. I got the the XML RPC thing

460
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,080
to work, so I can actually upload media from the N800. That was really cool. Oscar helped out on that.

461
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,520
But how do we actually get something implemented? First, I think I need to specify exactly what

462
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:30,280
it is. And I'm going to do that later today at curry.com, but I'll just give you a thought.

463
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:38,520
So coming out soon for the N800, or maybe even available as we speak, is a navigation kit.

464
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,640
And the navigation kit also comes with a holder, which will actually hold the N800. You know,

465
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,880
one of those, almost like the, I guess, the Tom Tom Go, you stick it onto the windshield. So,

466
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,640
you know, let's just say there's a holder, and we could bolt it on how we wanted to. But it will

467
00:32:53,640 --> 00:33:01,880
navigate for you. It's like a satellite navigation system. Okay. So, if, if we take into consideration

468
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,640
that we've got people who are driving predetermined routes, or more or less predetermined routes,

469
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,880
there's a two way flow to this. First of all, we want to make sure that they have their route

470
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,280
set out. And I presume that we're going to kind of semi-control which route they're going to take.

471
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:24,120
Okay. So, it would be nice if they could load up an overlay of the route, or just load up a route

472
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:30,840
file, which is fairly standard stuff. So, they can, you know, each person or team can follow that route.

473
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:40,600
All right. Here's what I want it to do. I want the system to continuously be recording its GPS

474
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,720
track. So, that's fairly simple. I want it to take a picture, and I've already checked with my

475
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,920
contacted Nokia when it's in navigation and the navigation dock, the little camera, the little

476
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:56,760
penis camera can be extended, which means you can roll that towards yourself, the driver, or roll it

477
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,920
forward out the windscreen, and it automatically inverts the picture so you get it right side up.

478
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,640
Okay. So, here's what we want. At regular intervals, I'm just going to say,

479
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:13,080
make it an hour just to be really simple. I want a picture taken. I want the GPS codes embedded.

480
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:19,880
And of course, I want the GPS track continuously stored. Whenever Trinity comes within range of a

481
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:26,840
Wi-Fi point, she detects it herself. I mean, the N800 automatically detects if there's a

482
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:32,280
usable network. So, it'll log in, signing, and then it'll say, ah, I have stuff to upload.

483
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:39,080
That's when I want it to upload pictures with the GPS information embedded into the pictures and the

484
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:46,680
GPS track. And that I think really would be enough, considering that the teams that we have

485
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,720
who are going to be driving Trinity across the globe, we might as well say, we'll be tasked with

486
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:58,200
creating video and audio podcasts. I think that that will be just by itself cool enough. Of course,

487
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,440
it'd be cool if we could have some of the diagnostics of her as well. But, uh, I don't think she's

488
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:10,120
ODB-2, 3, LMNO, PASAP compliance. So, there'll be nicer consent back to the telemetry data. But just

489
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:15,400
pictures at regular intervals with GPS codes embedded where the pictures were taken and the entire

490
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:25,240
track would be a dream. What do you think? Now, how do you help smart engineers and developers

491
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,520
actually create this if they don't have a device? Well, I came upon, I'd say a luminous idea.

492
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:38,120
I'm going to ask Luke at Nokia to send me the full blown N800 with NAVKID.

493
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,840
And I'm going to set it up on a dedicated IP address.

494
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:50,200
So, that she's connected to the net. And I want to, well, maybe we should figure this out.

495
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:57,240
But I think if we made a challenge where I give, um, sorry for the geeky terminology, SSH

496
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,880
access to each individual engineer for, let's say, three days at a time. Then we lock it off,

497
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,200
change the access, someone else can come in, can try out their builds, can try, you know,

498
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:14,200
can mess with stuff. I'll also set up VNC so that you can actually see the results of any

499
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,080
interface work that you're doing. I think it would be like a fucking awesome project.

500
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,920
And, you know, and I could just be looking at this stuff and actually testing it as we go,

501
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,760
wherever I am because, you know, I'll use like a, was it dynamic, what is it, uh, the dynamic DNS

502
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:38,360
people, or they are, you know, so that you can always have the same IP address, same DNS, entry,

503
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:45,240
even though your IP address changes. And you can just SSH right into the box, do your work,

504
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,200
do all your testing. I think three days should be enough. So, if you're interested, send me an email

505
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,120
Adam at podshow.com. And, uh, I got some syncing up to do with, uh, with Barbara, the Palo Alto

506
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:01,880
podcaster because I've just basically changed everything off. So, stay tuned for more updates.

507
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,640
Trinity. The cause of central luxury. Trinity. Trinity. Left the bio diesel set.

508
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,800
You bring Trinity. Trinity. Trinity. Trinity. Trinity.

509
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,640
Free Trinity. You save the world. You win valuable prizes. All right. It's Monday. Let's

510
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:25,800
crank this puppy up. Fresh from the pod save music network. Lemon heads.

511
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:56,760
It's all on the again. I can't balance in this race. It's no longer familiar to me.

512
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:12,280
It's become routine. The bedroom is too old. The subway is the old.

513
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:22,600
What I've heard of your style and I feel, have a feeling, have a feeling, have a feeling

514
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:45,880
strong. I can move it through the back of my mind. I'm not just fool's afraid from time to time.

515
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:56,840
I'm with us. We're in about to get no hold on me. We lost our right arm. It's that full free.

516
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:06,920
The bedroom is too old. The simple way to view.

517
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:18,040
The bedroom is too old. I've heard of your style and I feel, have a feeling, have a feeling,

518
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:31,960
have a feeling strong. I can move it through the back of my mind.

519
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:40,760
The tip to the last tip that's safety outstrip, but I know I'll end up shovel,

520
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:51,960
less than perfect fit. The bedroom is too old. Simple way to feel.

521
00:39:51,960 --> 00:40:01,960
The bedroom is too old. I can move it through the back of my mind.

522
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:11,960
I'm with us. I can move it through the back of my mind. I can move it through the back of my mind.

523
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:21,960
I can move it through the back of my mind.

524
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:45,320
The bed of number if you're calling from the United States, if you're in the UK, we've got a number

525
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,320
specially for you. Plug it into your phone.

526
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:10,840
For today, folks, back to the G-Mails. Looking for people who want to SSH me. Come into my

527
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:20,920
ports. Okay, so tomorrow may be coming to you from San Francisco. Then the show may be a little bit

528
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,000
delayed. Sometime this week, I do expect to go. Who knows? I might go straight to LA because we've

529
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,640
got some stuff going on. Hopefully the Oscars as well. The life. It is so busy.

530
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Stick it in your ear.
