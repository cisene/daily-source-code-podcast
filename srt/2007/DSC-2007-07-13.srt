00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
I can get through this, I can get through this, I can get through this.

00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,600

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,600
Wow!

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,000
It is Friday, the 13th today.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,700
And you are listening to DSC, 634.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,900
The Fubar Edition, similarly like myself.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,200
This day was fucked up already before it even started.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,400
And now, ladies, all the ladies, let's talk about channels.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
All right.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,600
For $60 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,400
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,300
We don't need no sticking, couldn't you?

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,800
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,300
I don't care.

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,100
I'll be asking you a matter of theory.

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,800
Give me another slide, I can't get through this.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,300
I can't get through this.

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,300
Oh!

22
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,300
I can't get through this.

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,300
I can't get through this.

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,300
I can't get through this.

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,300
People are all you ready!

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,900
Let's start the show.

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,400
You sure are a cup-up man and then the one behind the hood.

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Put it on for you.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,300
It's like that thick and won sweet fish.

30
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,900
Come in out the door, and you're a group, we go, make it all happen right here right now

31
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,900
I want to welcome you all to have some beer now, we eat it

Dr. Art Ruthy

109
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,260
We're if you missed it up for us, we're brought it back

110
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,240
Feel a bit of bangers a mess for the NCT incluso back, and black mashed

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,540
up with late sports calling out kicking off a foodbark frody on the daily

112
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,940
source code from swanky cereal everybody from the west side of G-town

113
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,780
it is the daily source code episode six hundred and thirty four

114
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,300
Beautiful day, we've got blue skies, we've got a little bit of wind

115
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,260
We got some clouds, but right now locally, it is fantastic.

116
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,460
I've got maximum music, full food bar for you,

117
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,940
all kinds of cool stuff coming your way.

118
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,940
And of course, apologies for the non-family safe

119
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,340
opening the other comic strip blogger.

120
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,380
But hey, who am I to complain?

121
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,660
Yes, because we've got one and only Amy Max.

122
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,660
Mm-hmm.

123
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,660
Amy.

124
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
Amy.

125
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
Amy.

126
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,660
Amy.

127
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,660
Amy.

128
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,660
Hey, Adam.

129
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,660
Hey, Amy.

130
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,660
Sorry about last week.

131
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,260
Once again, I was confused on my days.

132
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,820
And then I was going to send you one on Friday, four Friday.

133
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,020
And then I figured you're already done recording.

134
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,300
And then you didn't put up the food bar until Saturday.

135
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,300
It's so okay.

136
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,620
Amy was just not on our side.

137
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,300
Don't worry about it.

138
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
Don't worry.

139
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,700
Did I mention that I had caffeine today?

140
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,540
Uh-oh.

141
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,540
Anyway, how are you?

142
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,540
I'm good.

143
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,540
Thank you.

144
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,540
How about you, baby?

145
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Everything okay?

146
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,540
Good.

147
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,540
Yeah.

148
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,540
So, I think you're going to love this week's exercise.

149
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,540
Oh, yay.

150
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,540
Okay.

151
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,740
Since you've complained last time about it being too easy,

152
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,540
I haven't been easy for you.

153
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,540
Okay.

154
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,540
Does anyone say doozy anymore?

155
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,540
All right.

156
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,540
Sorry.

157
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
I'm going to be on the floor.

158
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,300
So go ahead and get yourself situated.

159
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,300
How long am I back?

160
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,940
You're going to lay on your right side and you're going to prop yourself up with

161
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,220
your right hand.

162
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,020
Now straighten the right arm.

163
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,020
All right.

164
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,580
Make sure that your hand is in line with your shoulder.

165
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,740
Yeah, it is.

166
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,300
Your left leg should be stacked onto your right leg.

167
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,300
Yeah, it is.

168
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
It hurts.

169
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Is it woodwork?

170
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
Okay.

171
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
Are you a triangle?

172
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Okay.

173
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Now, DSC kids, don't try this at home.

174
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
Okay.

175
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
Take your left leg and lift it up.

176
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,340
Crack.

177
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,340
Now bring it down.

178
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,340
Oh.

179
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,340
Take it forward.

180
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,340
I'm going to get the mic close.

181
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,340
I'm going to bring it back to center.

182
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,340
Forward.

183
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,340
And then up.

184
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,340
Yeah.

185
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,340
Or is this top?

186
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,340
And back down.

187
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,340
It's really hard.

188
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,340
Now to the back.

189
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,340
And then to the center.

190
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,340
Up.

191
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,340
One more time.

192
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,340
Up.

193
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
And down.

194
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
Don't tell me how to do on the other side.

195
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,340
Deep breath.

196
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,340
Great.

197
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,340
One more time.

198
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,340
And then we're going to switch sides.

199
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,340
Up.

200
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,180
Up.

201
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,180
Forward.

202
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,180
Down.

203
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,180
Down.

204
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,180
Forward.

205
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,180
Back to center.

206
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,180
Back to center.

207
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,180
Up.

208
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,180
Up.

209
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,180
Down.

210
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,180
To the back.

211
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,180
Back.

212
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,180
Center.

213
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,180
Center.

214
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,180
Up.

215
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,180
And back down.

216
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,180
Come down.

217
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,180
Another deep breath.

218
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
I'm sweating.

219
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,180
I'm sweating.

220
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,180
I'm sweating.

221
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,180
And switch sides.

222
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
Okay.

223
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
I'm on left now.

224
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,180
Okay.

225
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,180
Up on the left side.

226
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,180
Okay.

227
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,180
I'm on the shoulder.

228
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,180
I'm straight.

229
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,180
And the right leg goes up.

230
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,180
Down.

231
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,180
Down.

232
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
Front.

233
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
Front.

234
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,180
Center.

235
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,180
Center.

236
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,180
Up.

237
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,180
Up.

238
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Down.

239
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,180
Out.

240
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,180
To the back.

241
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,180
And center.

242
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,180
Again.

243
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,180
Up.

244
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,180
Down.

245
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,180
Front.

246
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
Center.

247
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,180
Back.

248
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,180
Up.

249
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,180
Down.

250
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,180
And back.

251
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,180
And center.

252
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,180
Great.

253
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,180
Take a deep breath.

254
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180
It's been fun, hasn't it?

255
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,180
I'm sure.

256
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,180
All right.

257
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,180
Until next time.

258
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,180
Oh wait.

259
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,180
Hang on.

260
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,180
Not yet.

261
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
What?

262
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,180
What?

263
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,180
No.

264
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,180
I'm not going to tell him about the health of Venice channel yet.

265
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,180
Because it's already.

266
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,180
Did you want to tell him about the channel editor?

267
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,180
Really?

268
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,180
Wow.

269
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,180
What?

270
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,180
All right.

271
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,180
Well, you guys heard it your first.

272
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,180
This is Amy Mack.

273
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,180
What?

274
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,180
You guys heard it your first.

275
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,180
This is Amy Mack.

276
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,180
What?

277
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,180
You guys say your name.

278
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,180
It's ridiculous.

279
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,180
Until next time.

280
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,180
Thanks, baby.

281
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,180
The one and only Amy Mack plays a gentleman

282
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,180
Our ray of sunshine through the clouds of anything.

283
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,180
Amy.

284
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,180
I didn't feel anything in my ass.

285
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,180
Let me rephrase that.

286
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,180
I didn't feel any muscle pull in the glutamus maximus region.

287
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,180
Yeah.

288
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,180
And my arms hurt and my legs hurt.

289
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,180
Nothing else worked.

290
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,180
Health and fitness channel, huh?

291
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,180
Hmm.

292
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,180
I wonder if we'd have that channel editor coming out soon.

293
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,180
Hey there, Adam.

294
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,180
It's pretty Mason.

295
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,180
You're a virtual girl fan.

296
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,180
It's just checking in.

297
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,180
I was hoping you'd like to play a game with me.

298
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,180
You like games, don't you, Adam?

299
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,180
Now there's no handcuffs or feathers involved in this one.

300
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,180
But you seem to know an awful lot about ancient 80s music.

301
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,180
Geekboy stuff like HTML.

302
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,180
Pop this and pop that.

303
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,180
But do you know your pop culture?

304
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,180
Are you ready for it?

305
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,180
You know what I mean?

306
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,180
I got to stop.

307
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,180
Brittany.

308
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,180
What happened?

309
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,180
Something's completely full barred.

310
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,180
I'm only hearing you through the through one channel.

311
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,180
Send it again.

312
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,180
Well, yeah.

313
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,180
Because I definitely want to test my pop culture knowledge.

314
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,180
Maximum music's full barred.

315
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,180
I'm the Danny source.

316
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,180
Come to everybody.

317
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,180
Rockin' it out for the pop team.

318
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,180
Music Network.

319
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,180
Health and digital.

320
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,180
Sweet system.

321
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,180
Now we're freaking out.

322
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,180
You system.

323
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
Dayo being gone.

324
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,180
Yeah.

325
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,180
Now we're free.

326
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,180
Really have to fall in.

327
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,180
Now we dance for your life.

328
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,180
And I'm beecontaining my points.

329
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,180
I'm just gonna dance for your peace of mind.

330
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,180
I'm going to sing your voice.

331
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Guess what it's like.

332
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,180
Enough.

333
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,180
That steam must've been to read me life to teach you the mine.

334
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,180
Brittany's gone.

335
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,180
You know you're gonna be insane.

336
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,180
See you soon, now we're waiting outside

337
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,180
We're waiting outside

338
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,180
Get more and more ready now

339
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:48,180
See you soon, now we're waiting outside

340
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,180
So many nights

341
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,180
So many nights, the time is up

342
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,180
Yeah, I wanna tell you, it's me

343
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,180
You're getting down, pushing me out into this town

344
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,180
Guess I've had a dream for the young dead news

345
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,180
I've made a man who's hoping to break me free from mine

346
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,180
Will be for you to keep your stay in the law

347
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,180
I've rubbed me through the nail

348
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,180
I've never had a roll all day

349
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,180
We don't hear well, so many hours to forward

350
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,180
So many nights, the time is up

351
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,180
We're waiting outside

352
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,180
So many nights, the time is up

353
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,180
Yeah, I wanna tell you, it's me

354
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,180
You're getting down, pushing me out into this town

355
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,180
We're waiting outside

356
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,180
Yeah, I wanna tell you, it's me

357
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,180
You're getting down, pushing me out into this town

358
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:52,180
I've made a man who's hoping to break me free from mine

359
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,180
Yeah, I wanna tell you, it's me

360
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,180
You're getting down, pushing me out into this town

361
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,180
Now we're waiting outside

362
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,180
So many nights, the time is up

363
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,180
So many nights, the time is up

364
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,180
Yeah, I wanna tell you, it's me

365
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,180
You're getting down, pushing me out into this town

366
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,180
We feel good, you know you're probably saying it

367
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:57,180
No way now seems to nails, now you're real real real

368
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:06,180
We feel good, now you're out of my eye, now you're real

369
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,180
We feel good, now you're real real

370
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,180
All right, I'll give you one guess where they're from

371
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,180
Think about it, it looks, it's guns and roses,

372
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,180
Motel crew, speed row, and fuel

373
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,180
You get it yet?

374
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,180
Of course, they're from Sweden, where else?

375
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,180
Hell and diesel!

376
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,180
Hell, hell and they're from Sweden

377
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,180
From the pot safe music network, link to that in the show notes at

378
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,180
Kicking ass of the Mexican music bar Friday

379
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,180
Shea were maximum music, but there's still lots of stuff

380
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,180
Coming into the phone numbers, now that I actually know how to get all the messages

381
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,180
It's almost overwhelming, but there's so much good stuff

382
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,180
Got him, hey, who is this?

383
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,180
I don't want to get my name, it doesn't matter

384
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,180
Listen, I happen to have about this music thing in the copyright board

385
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,180
I happen to know somebody who works

386
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:26,180
It's a executive at one of the very top level music streaming companies

387
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,180
You know the name and a heartbeat of your heart

388
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,180
Pandora

389
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:34,180
And just so happens, I was at a little Shindig with the guy

390
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,180
And I'm asked how's the company going

391
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,180
You guys gonna stay in business

392
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,180
Let me just stop for a second

393
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,180
For those of you who don't know the context of this

394
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,180
This is about this coming Sunday, July 15th

395
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,180
When the new royalty rates go into effect for streaming internet radio

396
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,180
Which I've discovered is really two things

397
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:00,180
It's either radio stations who are broadcasting their signal on the internet

398
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Or it's playlists of music

399
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,180
That are being streamed

400
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,180
Like live 365 Pandora last FM

401
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,180
Even to an extent, Napster and another online music services

402
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,180
Where you rent music

403
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,180
Those fees are going up significantly

404
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,180
And will be calculated on a per listener basis going forward

405
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,180
Actually, there's some of its retroactive

406
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,180
So I guess the question was that you pose to this executive of

407
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,180
And I love the fact that you're calling me anonymously

408
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,180
The question you pose to some exact of a big streaming company

409
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,180
Was are you gonna guys stay in business

410
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,180
And so this is about the regulation that kick off in July

411
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,180
July 15th

412
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,180
So the mood and at least at this particular company is not good

413
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,180
And he told me something that I don't think is widely known

414
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,180
There has been legislation, both in the Senate and the House

415
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,180
That would overturn this copyright board decision

416
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,180
Well, not entirely true, wouldn't overturn it

417
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,180
But it would certainly delay it and provide for some

418
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,180
Some breathing room for people to get their act together

419
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,180
And everyone to figure some stuff out

420
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,180
So it's not a complete overturn of the legislation

421
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,180
But it is a block of the legislation that's absolutely true

422
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,180
And I think that has been posted relatively widely

423
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,180
However, if you notice, you haven't heard me say about that, right?

424
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,180
On a mainstream

425
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,180
Well, a couple of weeks ago or so

426
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,180
Apparently of the heads of all these companies that would be affected

427
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:37,180
And the RIA and these are a couple of executives represented

428
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:43,180
And you're all brought into a room with some big monkey mucks and cops

429
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,180
Don't honestly know who it was, I don't remember

430
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,180
But it was like, you know, kind of a committee, some big guy

431
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,180
And this guy just sits and down and goes, all right guys, look

432
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,180
We are not going to legislate on this

433
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,180
So wait a minute, so we got Congress together

434
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,180
With all the the mucketing mucks of all these streaming radio companies

435
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,180
And Congress said, we're not going to vote on this

436
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,180
Boy, does this take me back to everything I've been saying for the past two weeks

437
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,180
You know, don't just write your congressman with some bullshit plea

438
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,180
Threaten them, that's the best way to work

439
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,180
They threaten you, threaten them

440
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,180
If you don't vote for what I want, if you don't vote the way I want you to

441
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,180
I will not vote for you, I promise

442
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,180
Guarantee, I'll get you out of office

443
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,180
It's the only thing that works, cut to the chase

444
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,180
You don't have to be nice and political about it

445
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,180
And just story, we don't want to have to vote on this

446
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,180
So we're not going to

447
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,180
So you guys are going to come back in a week

448
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,180
And you're going to tell us how you're going to work this out

449
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,180
You will do this

450
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,180
Now I haven't heard what the result of that was

451
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,180
It might have just been a bunch of FUs and that was it

452
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,180
And if the congress isn't going to vote for

453
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,180
Why would the music industry bother to make a deal with anybody

454
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,180
They force their concerns to help make you just go away

455
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,180
Yeah, they won

456
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,180
You know, we can go back to the 1980s with CDs cost 20 bucks

457
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,180
Um, anybody had to buy them, right?

458
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,180
But anyway, that's not widely known

459
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,180
And that is a God's honest truth as I understand it

460
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,180
Um, and things are just simply not looking good

461
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,180
Last SM sure those guys got bought

462
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,180
But there are a lot of other resources that are either dependent

463
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,180
Or part of another corporation

464
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,180
A lot of lines, those guys are not going to want to spend the money

465
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,180
To stay in business so

466
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,180
I don't know if it's interesting to you or not

467
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,180
It is great

468
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Oh, cool

469
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,180
Holder folder folder folder folder

470
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,180
An anonymous folder, ladies and gentlemen, appreciate the info

471
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,180
Do good intel

472
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,180
Yeah, that's not going to get overturned

473
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,180
That's clear unless it all of a sudden happens today

474
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,180
Um, so I doubt that

475
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,180
And there you go

476
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,180
It's clear there's only one direction

477
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,180
And it's very topical for me because I've been in conversations with

478
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,180
A large European independent record company

479
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,180
And we have a couple of them on the network

480
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,180
It was so great because

481
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,180
As I'm talking about having this company put all of their back catalog

482
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,180
On to the pod save music network and there's some awesome stuff in there

483
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,180
Um, and in fact, I can say it's red bullet

484
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,180
And uh, they have golden earring

485
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,180
You know, I've played some of this before because I got permission

486
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,180
So golden earring

487
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,180
Uh, focus, uh, shocking blue

488
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,180
Um, but his, uh, the sun has his own, uh, his runs a spin and records

489
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Which is a big dance label

490
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,180
Anyway, we had email conversation

491
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,180
And he brought in, um, his buddy Hine

492
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,180
Who is, um, on the board of epitaph records

493
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,180
And, you know, and I said, well in that interesting

494
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,180
Uh, Hine has over a hundred tracks

495
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,180
Uh, epitaph has over a hundred tracks on the pod save music network

496
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,180
So what's happening is this 25% of the music business

497
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,180
Which uh, is made up of independence

498
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,180
They're seeing the light, my friends

499
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,180
They are seeing the light

500
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,180
This, this, the whole conversation was in Dutch

501
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,180
I wish it could translate it because a lot of it just doesn't carry over

502
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,180
But one thing, um, uh,

503
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,180
Villam said Villam is the owner of the record company

504
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,180
He said

505
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,180
Essentially he said, what the fuck?

506
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,180
No guts, no glory

507
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,180
And I love that so much

508
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,180
Right, he's absolutely right

509
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,180
And we're just going to route around it

510
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,180
You know, this whole music thing, this whole license music

511
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,180
These, you know, the 40 most popular

512
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,180
You can't even name 40 most popular songs of the day

513
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180
Because you probably only can name

514
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,180
The top five or the top ten, if anything

515
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,180
It's the spectacle, it's part of the spectacle

516
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,180
You know, we've been talking about the society of the spectacle

517
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,180
And the, the business works perfectly

518
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,180
Um, you, uh, you create, uh, you've got a star

519
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,180
They have a hit record, uh, then the tabloids jump on top

520
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,180
And then there's all kinds of scandals

521
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,180
And it has to stir around, to wher around

522
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,180
And if you're, timely enough to be out with the tour

523
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,180
Or the album, you can benefit from that

524
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,180
And then of course, the artist self-destructs

525
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,180
And maybe we'll make a comeback later on

526
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,180
It's all about the society of the spectacle

527
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,180
I'm, uh, this is Mark Elso, Los Angeles, California

528
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,180
Listening to 633

529
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,180
A long time listener of, uh,

530
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,180
Well, basically, to Charlie and other podcasts

531
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,180
And, uh, I gotta tell you, you're right on the money

532
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Uh, when it comes to mainstream music

533
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,180
And, uh, when it becomes pot-safe music

534
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,180
And when it becomes, in alternative

535
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,180
For people to listen

536
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,180
And, um, it's just, uh, just bear with me a little bit

537
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,180
Because I haven't thought here

538
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,180
You know, in the States, NFL is really big

539
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,180
And baseball is big, but interestingly enough

540
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,180
They're charging a lot of places right now

541
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,180
For the NFL network to be able to watch

542
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,180
The NFL

543
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,180
And, uh, so all your favorite bars

544
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,180
And stuff like that

545
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,180
They, they got restrictions

546
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,180
They don't have the, they don't have the, uh,

547
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,180
The games you want to see

548
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,180
So, basically, people go other bars

549
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
And stuff like that, but

550
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,180
Oh yeah, well, it's, it's no different from the music business

551
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,180
I mean, sports rights

552
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,180
Oh man, sports sports rights

553
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,180
That's the, that's the big deal in television

554
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,180
That's the big draw, that's where all the money

555
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,180
In fact, that's not where all the money comes from

556
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
Drawing audiences

557
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
And, um, and because, you know,

558
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,180
A showing this in your bar

559
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,180
Is essentially a public performance

560
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,180
And, of course, that is prohibited

561
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,180
You know, you can do it, but you just have to pay money

562
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,180
Um, and believe me, they've got a force

563
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,180
Out on the ground that goes to every single bar

564
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,180
And they get charged for the music

565
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,180
They play, they get charged for the, uh,

566
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,180
Uh, the television they're showing

567
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,180
It's, uh, hey, it's not illegal

568
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,180
It's not wrong, it's just, you know,

569
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,180
They're basically forcing their customers away

570
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,180
Uh, and their customers, in this case, uh,

571
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Right now, our bars and, uh, public places

572
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,180
And, places where stuff is performed

573
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,180
Then use as well

574
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:43,180
So, uh, well, they're squeezing out every, uh, last drop of revenue

575
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,180
Which again, is, there's nothing wrong with it

576
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,180
It's what the organization has to do, you know

577
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,180
That's, that's the way the beast operates

578
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,180
They're losing money on sales

579
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,180
So they got to make it up somewhere else

580
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,180
Uh, excuse me, Coca-Cola

581
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,180
Um

582
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,180
What was the point I was going to make about that

583
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,180
Ah, I don't know, what's continued listening

584
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
Oops

585
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,180
Where the, uh, here we go

586
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,180
Uh, uh, there was a point I was going to make

587
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,180
I'll come back to it

588
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,180
I'm seeing, and one I'm predicting here is the rise of soccer

589
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,180
And, um, and it's just funny to watch it

590
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,180
Basically the more you control and try to control people

591
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,180
And the more you, you push a bunch of rules on things

592
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,180
People find other

593
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,180
avenues and, uh, as much as, believe it or not

594
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,180
I'm not a soccer fan, but dammit

595
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,180
I just watched Argentina beat Mexico

596
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,180
And somebody was explaining explaining to me

597
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,180
I don't know why, but how I was watching it

598
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,180
But dammit, it was exciting

599
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,180
And, um, and, and that's taken from me

600
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,180
Somebody would never even think about watching soccer

601
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,180
So, if, if you could put the same kind of logic in there

602
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,180
Just the idea that people will actually

603
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,180
Listen to other things

604
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,180
And, uh, it's, it's funny

605
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,180
Because whatever you want to call it

606
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,180
Big media or big paid media or whatever

607
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,180
Restriction media you want to call it

608
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,180
There's always going to be an avenue for other people

609
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,180
To enjoy and it expands itself and it creates

610
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,180
Other opportunities for people out there

611
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,180
So, yeah, big go

612
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,180
Right on man

613
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,180
Yes, indeed, in fact, uh, I noticed something very early on

614
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,180
When you've heard a pod save song

615
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,180
Which, of course, by definition, is not mainstream

616
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,180
Not a hit, it's not being jammed into you

617
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,180
Over and over again, but you hear

618
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,180
One or two times on a different podcast

619
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,180
You start to recognize it

620
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,180
You start to be able to sing along and I realize very early on

621
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:41,180
Oh, sounds like, wait a minute, this feels just like a, you know, mainstream

622
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,180
It's like I'm sing along to the hits

623
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,180
It's just, it's different hits coming from different places

624
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,180
Absolutely. Now, why do you think we have

625
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,180
Such a beautiful arrangement with British telecom here in the UK?

626
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,180
It's really simple

627
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,180
Just like, um, every, every media company

628
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,180
Um, basically has the same offering

629
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,180
You know, you've got your BBC channels

630
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,180
You've got your, uh, your, uh, your ITV or channel 4

631
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,180
And you can get the same offering

632
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,180
And of course, it's all the triple or quadruple play

633
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,180
Right, so you get your internet, your telephone

634
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,180
And your television

635
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
Uh, all through a box

636
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,180
So virgin media has a box, which comes through cable

637
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,180
We have sky, which comes through has a, they have a box

638
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,180
Comes through satellite

639
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,180
And then we have British telecom

640
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,180
Who have just recently put a box into limited release

641
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,180
Called, um, BT vision

642
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,180
And it's IP TV, so television over the internet

643
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,180
That comes through the DSL cable

644
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,180
Um,

645
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,180
Now, all of these companies

646
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,180
Basically go out and spend millions

647
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,180
On the same thing

648
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,180
So they spend millions on getting some movies

649
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,180
They spend millions on getting some, some rights

650
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,180
To some, to some sports in Europe

651
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,180
It's traditionally, uh, football

652
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,180
Or soccer as you would say

653
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,180
But it's all kind of the same thing

654
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,180
You know, there's no differentiator

655
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,180
Uh, unless of course you think of the concept of pod show TV

656
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,180
So that would be something very, very different to have on your box

657
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,180
Now wouldn't it? So that's really the main reason why why we're here

658
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,180
And why it's so exciting, uh, because, you know,

659
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,180
We are there to give people an alternative

660
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,180
Something cool to watch or to listen to

661
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,180
And they're coming

662
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,180
You know, people are secreting out

663
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,180
And in a certain point, it's just like it's not going to be seen

664
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,180
You know, not be labeled as alternative, but just

665
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,180
Good shit

666
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,180
Or maybe not so good shit

667
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,180
Who knows, maybe maybe I might become a big soccer fan

668
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,180
If that happens, it just tells you that

669
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,180
Uh, that those that are trying to control people

670
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:37,180
We'll find themselves in the loot short end of the stick

671
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,180
Yeah, and uh, maybe it's the same thing with music

672
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,180
Uh, absolutely meant, absolutely

673
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,180
Totally

674
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,180
Totally agree. Of course the whole shame of uh, of the music part is

675
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,180
Is that we're actually being restricted

676
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:53,180
And we are um, no longer able to share

677
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,180
The soundtrack to our lives

678
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,180
You don't hear the soundtrack to your life anymore, because it's not commercially viable

679
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,180
Because it's not a huge hit and can't be, you know, programmed in

680
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:07,180
To be shoved down the very thin tubes that traditional mainstream media has

681
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,180
If you're talking about radio

682
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,180
They just don't have time to play all the songs that are part of the soundtrack to your life

683
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,180
But we've got a solution to that, my friend

684
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,180
Hey Adam, how are you doing?

685
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,180
Right, man, how are you?

686
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,180
So hit this number, 78. I'm ready. Again, three very short clips

687
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,180
And the three answers, so you know how everything works

688
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,180
Oh, this is number one

689
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,180
Oh, please, John

690
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,180
Steven to me one more time

691
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,180
Frankie goes to Hollywood

692
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,180
Relax

693
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,180
That was pretty easy. Come on, crank it out baby

694
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,180
Give me some tough ones

695
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,180
And number two

696
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,180
Let the music play Shannon

697
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,180
Oh, yes, 1984

698
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,180
And number three

699
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
I think you got me on the third one there, John

700
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,180
Of course, I'll be saying oh crap when I hear it

701
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
And times up and these are the answers

702
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,180
Number one

703
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,180
From 84, Frankie goes to Hollywood

704
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,180
This is relax

705
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,180
Relax

706
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,180
When you want a second to it

707
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,180
Relax, don't do it

708
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,180
When you want to come

709
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,180
When you want to come

710
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,180
And so number one Frankie goes to Hollywood

711
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,180
I know what this is

712
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,180
So number two, also from 84, Shannon

713
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,180
We started

714
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,180
Yeah

715
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,180
Oh man, that was the jam back in the day

716
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:13,180
Yeah, what was number three

717
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,180
And so number two, Shannon and let the music play and this is answer number three

718
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,180
It's with me, Houston

719
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
Oh

720
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,180
Okay

721
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,180
Oh

722
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,180
Oh

723
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,180
Oh, yeah

724
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,180
Whitney Houston from 1987

725
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,180
As handsome number three and so emotional

726
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,180
And that concludes hit test number 78

727
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,180
Well, Adam, I hope you had them all and you did well

728
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Um, I had fun

729
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,180
Creating these answers

730
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,180
It was difficult to bring these tracks back to about 30 seconds

731
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,180
But I did it and it was kind of fun to do

732
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,180
So

733
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,180
Um, the answers and iTunes links can be found at hittest.partsio.com

734
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,180
And I'll be back probably next week

735
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,180
With hittest number 79

736
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,180
So until then, take care

737
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,180
Bye bye

738
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,180

www.gmail.com

741
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,180
Alright everybody, how about that for a Friday

742
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,180
Fix from the organization to the preservation for the soundtrack of our lives

743
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,180
Everything used under the fair use doctrine

744
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,180
Just thinking about Shannon let the music play

745
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,180
Just a personal anecdote about that

746
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,180
When I went to West Virginia to go to college

747
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,180
And I was planning on studying communications

748
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,180
And so I'm in BF West Virginia

749
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,180
Actually

750
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
New Clarksburg

751
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,180
And

752
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
And my roommate is Ty Hamilton

753
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,180
Ty is from Trenton, New Jersey

754
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,180
Black Kid and I was from Holland

755
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,180
I wasn't really a white kid

756
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,180
And we'd never met each other

757
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,180
So we're in, you know, in a relatively small dorm room

758
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,180
And we're kind of like hey man, how are you doing?

759
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,180
Like scoping each other a little bit

760
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,180
He pulls out his boom box

761
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,180
I pull out my boom box

762
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,180
And that was going to be the defining moment

763
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,180
You know, I'm sure he expected some incredible

764
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,180
My boom box instead

765
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,180
I clicked it on and played a tape

766
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,180
From the radio station that I had been working

767
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,180
At the pirate radio station Amsterdam

768
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,180
Called radio decibel and the song that I played

769
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,180
Was Shannon let the music play

770
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,180
And then he showed me how to

771
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,180
How to a body pop

772
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,180
I know it sounds real 80s

773
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,180
But it was a very defining moment in my life

774
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,180
I have to tell you

775
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,180
Y'all pull that, thank you once again

776
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,180
Body brought to you by Coca-Cola

777
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,180
This summer when you buy Coke

778
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,180
You get music

779
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,180
You can win an iPod or free songs or nightchains

780
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,180
You're outer, I'd like to make a motion

781
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,180
To rock this mother out

782
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:03,180
You're outer, please don't bang that gavel

783
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,180
You can try this cowbell out

784
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,180
Let's all give a night

785
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:13,180
To the hardest working lawyer

786
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,180
You're outer, what do you say?

787
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,180
You might even put the finger in

788
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,180
You know, how's it going

789
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Adam, it's Jersey Todd

790
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,180
The official musicologist of the Cha Cha

791
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,180
And well, the hardest working lawyer in podcasting

792
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,180
Yeah, that's the new title

793
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,180
But listen, I've got a great, great band

794
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,180
And a great, great story for you

795
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,180
I got somebody called The Seed Dragons

796
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,180
And I got a great, great story for you

797
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,180
I got somebody called The Seed Dragons

798
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,180
And I got a great, great, great story for you

799
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,180
I got somebody called The Seed Dragons

800
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,180
And I got somebody called The Seed Dragons

801
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,180
And I got a new York city

802
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,180
Actually, it's really just one guy

803
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,180
And some other guys went like all bands

804
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,180
But it's Darrell Thurston

805
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,180
And Darrell's been around for a really, really long time

806
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,180
He was a session artist

807
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,180
He was heard on HBO Showtime

808
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,180
He was heard in Madison Square

809
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
Garden when the next came out

810
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,180
And he's really been around for a long time

811
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,180
But he finally got back to writing songs on his own

812
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,180
And he's come up with a great one

813
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,180
That's up on the pot safe music network

814
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,180
This song is called Sweet The Lion Island

815
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,180
And I'm absolutely loving it

816
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,180
It's just kind of got this great kind of bird's feeling to it

817
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,180
And it just kind of really, really works for me

818
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,180
I think it's going to work for you too

819
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,180
Check this out

820
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,180
It's The Seed Dragons with Sweet The Lion

821
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,180
On your Food Bar Friday

822
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,180
Check this out

823
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,180
Oh

824
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,180
Walking down the dirt in the street

825
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,180
With the sunlight in her hair

826
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Seed with the nipples

827
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,180
She pretends that she don't care

828
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,180
Now I'm Caesar

829
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,180
Now I'm Notre

830
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,180
When she's back in home

831
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,180
Now I'm Notre

832
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,180
Life is Life

833
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,180
When she's all alone

834
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,180
Sweet The Lion Island

835
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:29,180
And you know it's getting better

836
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,180
And we can save the Lion

837
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,180
And now I'm Notre

838
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,180
When I'm Notre

839
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,180
When I'm Notre

840
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,180
When I'm Notre

841
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,180
When I'm Notre

842
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,180
When I'm Notre

843
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,180
When I'm Notre

844
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,180
When I'm Notre

845
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,180
When I'm Notre

846
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,180
When I'm Notre

847
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,180
When I'm Notre

848
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:59,180
When I'm Notre

849
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,180
When I'm Notre

850
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,180
When I'm Notre

851
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,180
When I'm Notre

852
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,180
When I'm Notre

853
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,180
When I'm Notre

854
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,180
When I'm Notre

855
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,180
When I'm Notre

856
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,180
When I'm Notre

857
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,180
When I'm Notre

858
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,180
When I'm Notre

859
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,180
When I'm過去

860
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,180
When I'm Notre

861
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,180
When I'm Notre

862
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,180
When I'm Austria

863
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,180
When I'm Notre

864
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:40,180
Sweet and I love it, now it's getting better every day

865
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:47,180
And no one else can make me feel this way

866
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:55,180
Now it's getting better every day

867
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,180
Now I'm not gonna make me feel this way

868
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,180
What can you do?

869
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,180
What can you say?

870
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:12,180
Sometimes you just want to run away

871
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:35,180
Sweet and I love it, now it's getting better every day

872
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:42,180
And no one else can make me feel this way

873
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:48,180
My thanks as always to the official music colleges of the Charney, Sir Jersey Todd

874
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,180
See Dragons and Sweet Delilah, you need to wake me up in the middle of the night to give me a sound like that

875
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,180
That's 60s kind of

876
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,180
I would call it the era of the pirate ships in the North Sea

877
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,180
Those of you old enough to know what the hell I'm talking about

878
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
Nice, really, really nice

879
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,180
Oh man, I'm not even halfway through my list of stuff to do for you today

880
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,180
Already at 36 minutes and that's without a check 1, 2, 1, 2 at the beginning

881
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,180
Today, if all things go according to plan, I can't promise it because it's not my call to make

882
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,180
But if all goes according to plan, we may be able to push cheddar live

883
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,180
Which means we'll be able to be messing around with channels all weekend long

884
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,180
You'll know how it's there

885
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:39,180
If you go to, if you have an account on pod show, you go to your profile page

886
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,180
So mine is adam.podshow.com

887
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,180
And at the top there there's a box and you click on my channels

888
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
And it'll look the same

889
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,180
Only there will be different options to play the channels

890
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,180
And you'll also see an edit channel button

891
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,180
That's really all that you have to look for

892
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:01,180
I don't know if I do anything better than you, but this is the way I see channels

893
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,180
This is for your call, I had to know what's what our control is

894
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,180
In your iTunes, you've got your podcast feed

895
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,180
So you've got your list of big busy news, daily source code, blah blah blah

896
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,180
Your channel is just an RSS feed, that's all it is

897
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,180
Put in the channel manager on pod show website

898
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,180
You're actually controlling what gets dumped into that feed

899
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,180
Oh James, I love it when you're on the money

900
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,180
Regardless of what it is, it does not have to be described

901
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,180
Somebody else's feed, it does not have to be described

902
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,180
XML or RSS, it's just it's

903
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,180
It's as easy as dragging a dropping an icon into a box

904
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,180
That's exactly what it is James, you don't have to know about feeds or anything

905
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,180
You just say, hey, here's an episode or here's a show

906
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,180
I want to put it into the channel, drag, drop, done

907
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,180
It's the files that you will top of yourself from other places on the network

908
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
I like that top up yourself, yeah

909
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,180
RSS feeds, so I can get for my wife, for her podcast channel

910
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,180
On iTunes, which she never updates, I can now create a channel for her

911
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,180
And drop in the favorite YouTube best of YouTube video

912
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,180
Or a favorite daily source code or an accident house

913
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,180
One episode at a time, all the entire feed

914
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,180
Do it, for example, I'm going to take 2-10 of best of YouTube

915
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,180
I'm going to drop that into a little bit, that's my feed

916
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,180
Then the next time my wife opens a iTunes and syncs a iTunes to podcast

917
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,180
It then goes to that feed, the one that I've created

918
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,180
Which will now call the channel

919
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,180
And it will pull them, what I've dropped in that book of media content

920
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,180
James, hold on, let me give you a boing

921
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,180
Oh, yes, I love it when you're right on the money, dude

922
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,180
So I control the RSS feed from within potential

923
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,180
Yes, does that make sense?

924
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,180
Yeah, even better than that, as you're roaming around pod show

925
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,180
If you find a show or an episode you like, you can just click get it

926
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,180
And then you can add it to the channel right from there

927
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
You can just say, oh, okay, I'm just going to add this to the channel

928
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,180
Just pop it right in

929
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,180
One after even go to the channel manager, you can just add it as you're surfing along

930
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
And any channel

931
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,180
Sound like what it's after

932
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,180
The reason that it works so well as far as I'm concerned

933
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,180
It's because I can take instead of going to my friends and send them an email

934
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,180
Go and check the send them a net download this download the other

935
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,180
I just give my friends my RSS feed

936
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
And see, stick that on iTunes

937
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,180
And every time you want iTunes all sent or I don't get it

938
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,180
You get all the stuff that I wanted to show you today at work

939
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,180
But instead of me taking 20 minutes out of the way to tell you all about this

940
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,180
You just download it anyway

941
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,180
Off you feed

942
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,180
And that's all it works

943
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,180
Because it's so all in comparison

944
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,180
You wear

945
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,180
And then the RSS starts getting complicated

946
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,180
I can take their feed and put them into one for me

947
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,180
Swat and take bobs and jones and clairs and sanders feed

948
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,180
And put them into one feed for me and don't let in my iTunes

949
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,180
So I don't have to subscribe to each individual one direct in iTunes

950
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,180
I just put all their feed in my feed

951
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,180
So now I've got my wife's feed and my friend's feed

952
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
And they will come in the iTunes

953
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
Yes, where it's complicated

954
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,180
You can stick those two in the one feed and pull that in

955
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,180
Put that right

956
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,180
Yes, that's right

957
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,180
That's right

958
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,180
James, I was smiling from just a shit eating grin

959
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,180
From ear to ear when I heard that

960
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,180
Just before the show, exactly James

961
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,180
And a couple caveats to that

962
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,180
I think when we push cheddar live

963
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,180
We won't have the get channel

964
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,180
Functionality live yet

965
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,180
Because we really don't know how that's going to work

966
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,180
We really don't know what the result is going to be on scale

967
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
You know, if

968
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,180
Who knows

969
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180
I really just don't know

970
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,180
So we want to make sure that we're not going to bring the site to its knees

971
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,180
If everyone's putting channels and channels and channels on the first day

972
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,180
So it's all beta and it's all going to be ugly

973
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,180
And it's not about the interfaces about the functionality

974
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,180
We're not going to promote this heavily

975
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,180
It's just you and me guys, essentially we're going to know about this

976
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,180
And one other thing I wanted to say

977
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,180
In our philosophy

978
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,180
Which, by the way, is not far from the philosophy of Apple

979
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,180
When it comes to operating systems and formats

980
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,180
But that's a different conversation

981
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,180
What if you had a channel of PDFs

982
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,180
Do you think those would play in the dashboard?

983
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,180
Could be. What if you had a channel of pictures from a gallery

984
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,180
What if you had a channel of blog posts

985
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,180
I mean all of a sudden you're seeing that you can mesh together

986
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,180
Feeds of all kinds of different content

987
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,180
And you can become a broadcast or a producer

988
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,180
A distributor of information

989
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,180
Extremely valuable stuff in the interconnected world

990
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,180
And I've been talking about this all week

991
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,180
Hopefully that'll go live today again

992
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,180
You'll know if you go to your profile page and you click on my channels

993
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,180
You'll see that there's different ways to output it

994
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,180
Not just to put it on your iPod James, but you can also say, hey, just play it right here

995
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,180
So if you're not near your iTunes, you can just log into your account

996
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,180
Any web browser and enjoy your channels on the dashboard

997
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,180
Right from poncho.com or put it into Windows Media Player

998
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,180
Or some other player that'll handle everything

999
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,180
It's a big one

1000
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,180
I'm really excited about

1001
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,180
Hey podcast business

1002
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,180
My name is loosegagging and I'm inviting you to my Los Angeles Music Awards showcase

1003
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,180
Well, I've got nominated for best alternative song with my track what I

1004
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,180
And if you're in the alley area, Sunday July 15th

1005
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,180
Come on over to the parliament

1006
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,180
It's a 3, 3, 8, 7, motor Avenue, West LA

1007
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,180
And from more information and tickets, you can go to my website

1008
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,180
Which is over at nooshscalgan.com

1009
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,180
That's n-o-u-s-h-s-k-a-u-g-e-n.com

1010
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,180
And see it show you my teeth

1011
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,180
This is Busy Kajou and each and every week on Solipsistic Nation

1012
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,180
I play the absolute best from all genres of electronic music

1013
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,180
This week we'll delve into grime and dubstep and their love child grime step

1014
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:42,180
We'll hear a music from focus, tecmatics, DJ Flex and much much more

1015
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,180
Plus interviews with Leo from grime step international and the lads from the UK connection

1016
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:54,180
Quick rapping with like the electronic hip hop sounds that's based in some sort of Jamaican groove

1017
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,180
It's really hard to explain it without using the term grime

1018
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,180
The drum sculpt is made of a blue bric and it's brought it back to the room

1019
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,180
The past is made of kind of bad enough

1020
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,180
The drum sculpt kind of just brought it back in with these blue grimes

1021
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,180
Cut them out and I'm feeling it messed up

1022
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,180
I think it's just being in a back to the room

1023
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,180
Join us at Solipsistic Nation.com

So we want a T.F.I.S.A.A.C. Nation.com

1027
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,180
What's up together?

1028
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,180
The page nine and you're listening to the daily source code

1029
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,180
Look in for your mind's eyes

1030
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,180
Hell yeah

1031
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,180
Marcus Kaos checks it

1032
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,180
Bring us another page nine

1033
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,180
Mark the pussy

1034
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,180
I'm from our front end

1035
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,180
Laced in transmittions of anonymity

1036
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,180
There'll apply's wasted space in my vicinity

1037
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,180
The picture holds all sorts of vast ability burning up

1038
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,180
Do the arms up, but they're never near

1039
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,180
How many of you let the pussy down

1040
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,180
You might know from a minute

1041
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,180
Then you'll be thinking in time

1042
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,180
This will work as I don't know

1043
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,180
That will be up to let the pussy come down

1044
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,180
Ha ha ha

1045
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:14,180
I'm not in a fair night

1046
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,180
Say it anyway

1047
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:21,180
I'm not in a fair night

1048
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:26,180
I'm not in a fair night

1049
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,180
The other time I actually must talk for there we go

1050
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,180
That what excuses will you know is not that scary now

1051
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,180
It's only my mind about you to take care of you

1052
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,180
But he's a jet that I can fight

1053
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,180
I'm good for you

1054
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,180
I'm not in a fair night

1055
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,180
I'm not in a fair night

1056
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,180
Then you'll be thinking in time

1057
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,180
This will work as I don't know

1058
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,180
That will be up to let the pussy come down

1059
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,180
Ha ha ha

1095
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,420
is that you've knocked you on the ground agnag recipe?

1096
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,280
Yeah that's right well you'd rather talk to my wife but you know we just

1097
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,380
called we wanted to call you the pod father and announce our a year at the

1098
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:34,460
wheel podcast video cast and you know and we're gonna drive around for a whole

1099
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:40,300
year and talk to people and videotape them and podcasts. Yeah exactly and

1100
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,540
you should go on and explain the adamant that said I'm creeped like I'm an

1101
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:48,340
gateway. It's because you watched how you were coming from Stanford so

1102
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:55,780
yeah I think. Anyway you know I year at the wheel.com. Yeah check it out it can be

1103
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,260
so much fun and hopefully we won't get arrested anywhere. Yeah we end up

1104
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:03,900
watching a DC November I'm super Tuesday November 4th and we're gonna go

1105
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,860
like to stirge his bike rally and the Republican National Convention so we're

1106
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,780
mixing it up because we're gonna cover the election for a whole year. And you

1107
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,900
know podcasting is basically ruined our life so we just thought we'd go

1108
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,500
with it you know we've started we've been podcasting for four years we got thrown

1109
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,940
out of a town because of it and no embrace the hate. Okay look this is such a

1110
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:29,260
long message okay bye yeah Mr. Curry. Thanks thanks for making me feel old

1111
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:34,460
at the rear very in there. Okay very interesting. The reason of course why I

1112
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,100
find this interesting is I think this is a perfect tie in for the one and only.

1113
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:59,500
If you recognize the tune sing along. Okay you kids now I'm not quite sure

1114
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,860
about you getting thrown out of a town and in fact that only kind of enhances

1115
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:07,180
the appeal to me. I like rebels. I think this is what I've been looking for and

1116
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:11,020
just hit me just before the show that I'd like to make you guys an offer. Now

1117
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,700
let me just play a little open kimono here on the free Trinity Project.

1118
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:20,500
A whole lot of water under the bridge. I see it as a very very complicated

1119
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,500
to do with multiple people and you were the first ones who well you're of

1120
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,580
course you're not offering this to me but you're going to be on the road for a

1121
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:31,780
year. Now I've been trying to get this Trinity Project set up and I know that

1122
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:37,380
it's going to take money and resources and effort to really pay it off and make

1123
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,020
it work and we want to have lots of people involved. They need to have expenses

1124
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:48,380
covered or at least that because it's a big deal. It's driving a car that can

1125
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:53,500
fall apart easily. So we went searching for some sponsors. We got some

1126
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:59,100
interest from Nokia and due to all the talk about that Tom Tom go became very

1127
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:03,380
interested in fact that they come out with their new summer GPS products. So

1128
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,460
they come out with their new products, the GPS products in the summer and

1129
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:11,380
believe it or not we also got some significant interest from Mercedes Benz who of

1130
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,420
course love the whole idea that they're car or they're one of their models as

1131
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,900
being used. Although not entirely representative of the current Mercedes Benz

1132
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:25,660
line I might add out point out. So here's what I propose to you guys. I would

1133
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:31,660
love nothing more than to have you spend a year at the wheel in Trinity and

1134
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,860
here's the commitment I'll make. We will make sure that she stays on the road.

1135
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:41,420
Either we'll do it or we'll do it withheld from Mercedes Benz who may have to

1136
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:47,260
provide a sweep up van pick up all the bits behind her but that should be

1137
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:51,660
relatively doable. I think the engine will hold together just by every single

1138
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:57,540
part has been replaced so that should work. To cover your expenses not just the

1139
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,220
expenses of what you're doing but really for producing the content I'd like to

1140
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:06,060
compensate you. I'd like to pay you to do that and that's where I'd like the

1141
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:09,460
community to kick in and help you guys determine where you're going to do

1142
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:14,180
where you're going to go. And can you imagine how awesome it will be to have a

1143
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:23,460
biodiesel car show up on super Tuesday? I mean it seems so logical to me.

1144
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:27,460
So there you go. I think we finally have something. I don't know if I can get

1145
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,820
the sponsors in but I will commit if you guys will commit to staying on the road

1146
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:35,740
for a year and doing it in Trinity I'll commit to keep the car on the road and I

1147
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:41,980
will compensate you guys for doing this and for let's see actually I'm looking

1148
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:45,660
at the year to wheel.com see sponsored you guys have any sponsors yet no

1149
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:52,260
not yet. Okay so if you're interested let me know because I think we finally

1150
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,860
have something and we can still you know hit all the people who are interested

1151
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:00,180
in participating because you'll just stop by say hi to everybody and we'll

1152
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:04,580
create podcasts and video stuff and we'll cause a ruckus and we're going to get

1153
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:08,180
noticed. I know we will and it's all about independence. You too seem like

1154
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:15,060
very independent spirits. So and apparently you know you can do this. You can

1155
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:22,140
f off for a whole year and drive around. I'm insanely jealous. So that's my

1156
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:26,300
thought. I'd love to hear from you guys open kimono time really appreciate the

1157
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:31,620
feedback. All right one more song for today then. One of new black lab

1158
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:36,900
comes out you can't help but play it. No I'm saying I mean guys are such friends

1159
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,780
of the Charlie. Don't know if this is up on the PMN yet but Neil sent the

1160
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,780
to me so happy to play it.

1161
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:20,540
And I'll make you sad. I won't give up and don't mind waiting. I can't wait

1162
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:28,780
another day. I won't give up and don't mind what to do but I can't walk away

1163
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:36,780
because I lost myself. I lost my heart. I won't mind but you crush my heart.

1164
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:45,780
I know that I've got one last chance to show you the real you.

1165
00:55:49,780 --> 00:56:01,580
So will you stay still a little while? Everything is easy when you love me

1166
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:15,580
and see you smile. I'll go down down before it's through. It's not the secret

1167
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:24,580
that I wouldn't do feel. I won't give up and don't mind waiting. I can't wait

1168
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:30,580
another day. I won't give up and don't mind what to do.

1169
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:39,580
And I can't walk away because I lost myself. I lost my heart. I won't mind but you crush

1170
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:48,580
my heart. I know that I've got one last chance to show you the real you.

1171
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:16,580
So will you stay still a little while? Everything is easy when you love me

1172
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:26,580
and see you smile. I'll go down before it's through. It's not the secret

1173
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:32,580
that I've got one last chance to show you the real you. So will you stay still a little while?

1174
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:42,580
I'll go down before it's through. It's not the secret that I've got one last chance to show you the real you.

1175
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:53,580
So will you stay still a little while? Everything is easy when you love me

1176
00:57:54,580 --> 00:58:06,580
I'll go down before it's through. It's not the secret that I've got one last chance to show you the real you.

1177
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:14,580
Black Lab brand new and of course big friends of the show.

1178
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:21,580
Man it's almost been an hour. It's been quite a ride. It's been a very vocal aggressive maximum music

1179
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:27,580
full bar Friday. I'm almost fatigued from doing all this today.

1180
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,580
It's Friday.

1181
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:39,580
Well the final thought for this week is all about the society of the spectacle red pill blue pill stuff.

1182
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:44,580
So let's just say that we all are caught in the society of the spectacle and whatever

1183
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:50,580
the spectacle of the day is the spectacle du jour. We pay attention to it and get completely sucked into it.

1184
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:57,580
So stuff like the earth is going to explode and die. We're going to die of horrible diseases.

1185
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:03,580
A Britney Spears is the best thing since sliced bread. And Paris, Hilton going to jail. These are all spectacles.

1186
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:10,580
And of course what's really happening is that people are starting to basically take the red pill

1187
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:16,580
and unhook from the matrix and they're finding alternatives. They're finding different music, different programming,

1188
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:21,580
different media, different people, different connections, different contacts, mainly throughout the internet.

1189
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:24,580
And that is really the revolution.

1190
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:29,580
And you know, revolutions aren't just one single event. They often take many, many, many events

1191
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:35,580
and many, many years to finally push through. And I think that we're kind of in the same situation.

1192
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:44,580
So instead of trying to convince people to unplug from the matrix, instead of trying to give them the choice of taking the red pill,

1193
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:51,580
I think we have to create our own spectacle. So things like a year at the wheel with free Trinity, that's a spectacle,

1194
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:57,580
things like bum rush the charts, that's a spectacle. You know, we have to create these spectacles to get people to say,

1195
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:02,580
Oh, wait a minute. There's another spectacle over there and jack into our matrix.

1196
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:07,580
And then it's very easy for us to slip them the red pill. You know what I'm saying?

1197
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,580
So keep that in mind. Oh, and there's one other thing I was thinking about last night.

1198
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:15,580
It is time for me once again to post a link to the Zen TV experiment.

1199
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:20,580
I've done it probably about twice a year for the past three years.

1200
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:24,580
And it's time to post it once again. If you really want to know what television is doing to you.

1201
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:36,580
Right down to the heart of this whole flap. I don't know if you were following it. The BBC had a trailer running for a documentary about the queen.

1202
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:43,580
And Annie Leibowitz and one scene was photographing the queen. And she asked the queen if she could take the crown off.

1203
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:49,580
And the queen made some remark cut to the queen's storming off. Well, it turns out, and I love this.

1204
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:53,580
It turns out that that was a setup. The queen didn't actually storm off.

1205
01:00:53,580 --> 01:01:01,580
In fact, they took footage of her walking into the room and made it seem like she got pissed off about the question and walked off with a photo shoot.

1206
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,580
And they had to apologize to the queen because it didn't happen that way. Oh, gee.

1207
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:09,580
You mean you're telling me that television lies? No.

1208
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:13,580
You're not actually going to tell me that they fake stuff to make it more interesting? No.

1209
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:17,580
You're not going to tell me that happens through video editing. Are you? No. Oh, my gosh.

1210
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:20,580
There's gambling going on here. No.

1211
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:26,580
So you take this as MTV experiment. And then you tell me. Next week when you call and you tell me,

1212
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:31,580
if you don't think that you are completely blue-pilling yourself when you're watching mainstream media.

1213
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,580
And that my friends is the final thought of the week.

1214
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:46,580
