00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
This is Chef Mark from Remarkable Palette and Jennifer from Food Philosophy.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,900
We've got the perfect recipe for seasoning your pocho experience to perfection.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,800
Start with a network full of informative content and talented podcasters.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,600
Add a heaping tablespoon of great listeners who can make the experience even better with their feedback.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,000
Perhaps your dashboard isn't mashing or you're having trouble locating that fantastic podsafe song you heard.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,400
Pocho wants to know how you want your entertainment served.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,900
Just head on over to survey.pocho.com and register to add your own spice to the dish.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,400
And we like it spicy.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Okay, we know you have the DSC 625.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
We only want to the show.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
So come out nice and easy.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Playing the DSC 625 with you and no one will get hurt.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,400
It seems that using the waterclaws it based on our infrared scans.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
And that's the only use of folders so it may take it as a while.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Okay, after you wipe your bum, bring out the DSC 625.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,400
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

19
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Here is the one we're on.

20
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,400
I should've known who it was along.

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,400
This region.

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,400
I keep finding you.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:08,400
This dimension always keeps me finding something.

24
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,400
But try to avoid your wrath.

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,400
We've got some changes to my path.

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,400
I thought I had it all figured out.

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,400
But even when I was above,

28
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I turned around and there you are.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
This region.

30
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,400
I keep finding you.

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:45,400
This generation always keeps me finding something new.

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I can't walk you the way from you.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
It's true.

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
The chase is what it thought we can do.

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,400
So I guess I should get used to you.

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:24,400
This I should get used to you.

37
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
But I know who it was along.

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I turned around and there you are.

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:43,400
I keep finding you.

40
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,400
This dimension always keeps me finding something new.

41
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
It's kind of got the California sound, don't you?

42
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
John Hoskinson.

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
This rejection.

44
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,400
I guys don't we all know it.

45
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Daddy source code episode number four hundred and twenty six.

46
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
I ended kind of nicely.

47
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Didn't that.

48
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Oops.

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Oh man.

50
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Who's calling me?

51
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Where are you?

52
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Where's?

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
I'll just have to wait.

54
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Is the Nokia saying who it is?

55
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Ah, yes.

56
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
It is the sales weasel extraordinaire.

57
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
A to the B.

58
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
We have an A to the B on the sales team.

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Forget it.

60
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Come into you from the affluent suburb of Surrey known as

61
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Gilford.

62
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,400
We're on the west side of G town from the curry manner all the way up in Adams attic.

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
This is the daily source code.

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Oh boy.

65
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Sorry about yesterday.

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
I tried to post the show before I had to go to London and something was wrong.

67
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,400
I don't know if it was cast blaster or something on the network.

68
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
But I tried twice to upload before I had to leave and I left it for a third

69
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
time to upload and just never made it.

70
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,400
So I didn't get back until nine 15 last night from from the UK crash pad.

71
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
It was very busy.

72
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
First of all, the road was busy.

73
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
That sucked.

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Although the trip in and I take a car service in if I'm going later in the afternoon.

75
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Well, if I'm not going first thing in the morning because of course nothing beats the train at that point.

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:10,400
And it's nice because all the way up the what is it the A three and twenty five

77
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
God knows what I'm driving on.

78
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,400
You can really see the cloud formations and it's been quite spectacular this past week.

79
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
You might have read that we had severe flooding.

80
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Yeah.

81
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
No, you left a voicemail.

82
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,400
We had severe flooding of north and I still have to take a trip up north to to Gerro.

83
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
I was planning on doing it this week.

84
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
That's where Christina's pink mini is located.

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,400
It's like 250 miles north right near Newcastle.

86
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Luckily, Newcastle has a fantastic airport.

87
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,400
So that trip is planned for this weekend.

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Saturday or Sunday when the weather's just a little bit better.

89
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,400
And I can take someone along who knows the area.

90
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Anyway, yesterday, let's see two well besides seeing everybody and hanging out and shooting the shit and coming up with great ideas,

91
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,400
which is usually what happens when we're all altogether.

92
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,400
The new episode of O.J. Borges Show, 11th Commandment.

93
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,400
You've got to see, you've got to see this new show.

94
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,400
You can find it at 11 dot podshow.com, ELEV and 11 dot podshow.com.

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,400
And he's basically on a quest from God who has given him an 11th commandment,

96
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,400
and that is the whole show not be boring.

97
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,400
And he gets into, he interviews this,

98
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,400
was at MMA type cage wrestling, ultimate fighter dude.

99
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,400
And he does the interview while basically being pummeled.

100
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,400
And you know, O.J. is not a puny guy.

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,400
I mean, he's muscular and he's got some meat on them bones.

102
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,400
And he got, in fact, one of the, you left to see it for yourself.

103
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,400
But one of the fighters said, I can make you cry like a girl within 30 seconds.

104
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
And O.J. is like, oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure.

105
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,400
I think it was 17.3 seconds.

106
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,400
He was already warning like a baby.

107
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,400
So that's up today, 11 dot podshow.

108
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,400
11 dot BT podshow.com, if you will.

109
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Then one of our investors from the DAG group was in London vacationing,

110
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,400
so he dropped by, he had never seen the crash pad,

111
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,400
and it lived up to his expectations completely.

112
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,400
And that was always fun to meet with our investors,

113
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,400
because these guys are just so out in the stratosphere when it comes to smarts.

114
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,400
And understand a lot of different marketplaces that were not as well versed in.

115
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
So it was great to catch up with him.

116
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,400
And then a guy came by and this was a hookup.

117
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,400
That's actually probably what the sales we used to land was calling about.

118
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,400
It was, let me just, Anthony Holden is his name.

119
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I don't know if you've ever heard this name.

120
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,400
But he wrote a, well, he's, he is an author.

121
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
He's written a number of books.

122
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Some of them about the royal family, actually, to make it even crazier.

123
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,400
But he wrote a, a cult classic about poker called,

124
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Oh, Jay, let me just see.

125
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
This is great, great show prep curry.

126
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Holden, I'll tell you exactly what his name was.

127
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
What his, what the name of his book was.

128
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,400
He wrote one of them, which I think sold over like a million copies.

129
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
He had big deal, that's it.

130
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,400
And he wrote a new one, recently called, a bigger deal.

131
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,400
And it's really more about the culture of, of poker than about the games themselves.

132
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,400
But this guy is, is quite a celebrity on the poker circuit.

133
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
And in fact, he's on his way.

134
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,400
I think today or tomorrow to the world poker tour in Vegas.

135
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,400
And he was really interested in, in turning some of his books into audio novels.

136
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,400
He wants to do, you know, one of our classic formats, which is a roundtable of experts about anything.

137
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Which we've discussed on this show works extremely well.

138
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
And he would love to do that.

139
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
I was like to do some video stuff.

140
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,400
So it was really enjoyable because this guy was so knowledgeable and fucking sharp.

141
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,400
But he also had a total poker player or a bottom.

142
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,400
He came in like a cloud of smoke, literally.

143
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,400
And just every, out of every poor of his body was oozing smoke.

144
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
And he's like, yeah, I like places where I can smoke.

145
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
That's why I'm going to Vegas.

146
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Hey, man, we'll put a deal.

147
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,400
I'm talking like he was American, but he was actually proper English.

148
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
No, we'll put, we'll put in agreement together.

149
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
When I come back from Las Vegas, or if I win, we'll do the deal in Las Vegas.

150
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Like, all right.

151
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
So that was good.

152
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,400
That was, it's fun when you meet people who are really into something and that there's

153
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
a real marketplace for it.

154
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,400
You know, poker is booming booming.

155
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,400
So look for a poker channel to be erected soon.

156
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Project Cheddar still going very well.

157
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Andrew and Devon has promised me to deliver updates as they come along.

158
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
There's really nothing.

159
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,400
The probably won't be anything to report until sometime next week.

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
And hopefully we'll be surfacing some of this stuff live.

161
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
So you can see it.

162
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,400
There's a good healthy discussion going on at daily source code.com in the show notes,

163
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,400
comments, as well as at curry.com about what these channels are and what they do and how they work.

164
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,400
And so far, we're seeing two groups of people really, really enjoying them.

165
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,400
One is audience members and advertisers, interestingly enough,

166
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,400
for also really gravitating towards the concept of channels of package content.

167
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,400
So we'll just keep plugging away.

168
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Also had a chat with the Chris McIntyre to know as many to many known as the Firf.

169
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,400
And the Firf has taken a very important role now in the company.

170
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,400
You know, of course, he's the Lord and Master of Podcast Ali.

171
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,400
But he now is literally sitting inside the developer group.

172
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,400
And he'll be managing our APIs and developer relations.

173
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Yeah, we have right now, I think is fairly simple.

174
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
It's based on XML RPC.

175
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,400
So in the next week or so, we'll be adding new, this is just for geeks.

176
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,400
We'll be adding new APIs.

177
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,400
I think we're a rest interface and JSON and there's maybe something else.

178
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,400
I don't know, but he'll be calling in regularly to let us know as well.

179
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
And I'm sure at least one person will be happy with us.

180
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,400
I think, bro, winner, at your command, it's the role of the program.

181
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
That's right, from San Francisco, California.

182
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
I add them.

183
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
It's a prolific program.

184
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
I hear from San Francisco.

185
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,400
I noticed on DSC, whatever the show was, for Tuesday,

186
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:14,400
June 26th, you were talking about Gordon Brown.

187
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,400
I am British and I believe he and Blair are two things the same back side.

188
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
And that's the same kids.

189
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Two, what of the back side?

190
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Maybe men, two sides of the same coin, what was that?

191
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,400
You know, I believe he and Blair are two things the same back side.

192
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
And that's the same kids.

193
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Two cheeses of the same size.

194
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
I can't understand a prolific program.

195
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
But I do appreciate it.

196
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:49,400
By the way, I forgot to thank Ed, who sent me a couple suggestions for some music to play on the show.

197
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Where's Ed from?

198
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Suitcase full of dimes.

199
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Interesting.

200
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Suitcase full of dimes.blogspot.com.

201
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Yeah, very good.

202
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Very good suggestion, dude.

203
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Totally appreciated.

204
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,400
A couple more suggestions and recommendations that came in.

205
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I want to actually play a music video for you.

206
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Because the song is so awesome.

207
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,400
And I think it's pretty much a mainstream license.

208
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Probably has a record deal type song.

209
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,400
I've never heard of the artist before, but I'm sure many of you have Rodney Carrington.

210
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,400
And this is obviously a copyrighted video that's up there on YouTube because it's from some kind of television special.

211
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
And I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

212
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,400
But it's something that I think you'll enjoy listening to the lyrics for sure.

213
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:39,400
But then when you go back and look at the video, you will not be disappointed.

214
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,400
So if you close your eyes and imagine, I'll try and give you the setting.

215
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:52,400
It's probably like a 700 to 1000 seat venue.

216
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
It's a nice stage.

217
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Guy with a cowboy hat, blue jeans sitting on a stool with a gift fill with his guitar.

218
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,400
And he is singing a song called Show Them To Me.

219
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,400
And well, listen along and you'll get the general, the gist of it.

220
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,400
And then when you go back to watch the video at home, you'll be smiling even more.

221
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:19,400
I don't know if I love you, but you sound like somebody I could love.

222
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Drought and horny.

223
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,400
And I love that.

224
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Oh, it seems to mean this whole world long crazy.

225
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,400
There's too much hate and killing going home.

226
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:49,400
When I see the bare chest of the woman, my worries and my problems are all gone.

227
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,400
No one thinks fighting when they see your topless girl.

228
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:01,400
Maybe if you'd show yours too, we could save the world.

229
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Right, so you get it.

230
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Now the audience, we see the audience and the audience is lit up.

231
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:26,400
And there she goes.

232
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,400
God bless you.

233
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
God bless you.

234
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
God bless you.

235
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,400
I don't care if they don't match your arms, but you're in the other.

236
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,400
You can show me one.

237
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,400
And I'll imagine the other.

238
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Even if you're really old, there's nothing wrong.

239
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Don't be saggy, boobs ain't bad.

240
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,400
They're just a little long show them to me.

241
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Them down to me.

242
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Little sleepy star, to let the whole world sing.

243
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Just like this round show with your body like that, pal.

244
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,400
But he got us cheeky.

245
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,400
What you Spanish for, Tittet Records and nothing we listen to,ש tittets.

246
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Them down to me.

247
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,400
I've made a lot of them, but another one I've hated.

248
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Even if you've had 13 kids and you think they look deflated,

249
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,400
there's no such thing as a bad breast.

250
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
I believe there's much is true.

251
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,400
If you're a big fat man, I would tell you if I hadn't,

252
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
I'd love to see yours too.

253
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
And everybody now.

254
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Oh, no.

255
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Another guys showing their tits.

256
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,400
It's kind of rough.

257
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Yeah.

258
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Show them the name.

259
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Show them the name.

260
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Just like the girls don't wild don't TV.

261
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Just lean back and show your act and I'll be in ecstasy.

262
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:31,400
If you've got two customers, so now to me.

263
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Come on baby, let me see.

264
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,400
All the world I live in harmony.

265
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,400
It'll be a good little game it would.

266
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,400
We'll make history.

267
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,400
You love your country.

268
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Yes.

269
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
It's got the flag up now.

270
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I'm going to say one more time.

271
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,400
I say we love your country.

272
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Dallas, Texas.

273
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Do you love your country?

274
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Yeah.

275
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,400
We stand here as much as everybody can to me.

276
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
I love that.

277
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,400
I need a gig like that, man.

278
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,400
What an awesome, awesome song to play live.

279
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,400
I'd like to shake your daddy's hand.

280
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Never damn nice.

281
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Thank you, sir.

282
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
We're riding those to this country.

283
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,400
It's been a damn pleasure, sir, for them.

284
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Rust, if you have to be ashamed of yourselves.

285
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,400
Our men and women fight across C.C.

286
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,400
But you're fucking freedom and you can't whip out a tear.

287
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Oh, man.

288
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
Fantastic.

289
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,400
I'm telling you, I need a gig like that.

290
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,400
Ladies, ladies, listen to this show right now.

291
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Show them to me.

292
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Go ahead.

293
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Yeah.

294
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
There you go.

295
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Just pull them out, whatever.

296
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Oh, you've made an old man so happy.

297
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Thank you.

298
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
And thank you, St. Clair, for sending me the link to that.

299
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Of course, I'll put that in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

300
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Some other cool news that came in on the email.

301
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
This is from the candy man.

302
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Now, you know, I'm a big fan of the Nokia N800, the Internet tablet, which I use,

303
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,400
particularly when I'm in London because I have the cloud.

304
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,400
So it automatically connects the network, almost wherever you are.

305
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
It turns out now.

306
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Let me see.

307
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Here's the announcement to EarthLink announced that Nokia N800 Internet

308
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,400
tablet customers can now access EarthLink's Wi-Fi service at no additional charge on

309
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,400
this municipal wireless networks and select cities throughout the United States.

310
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Nokia N800 customers will be able to securely connect to EarthLink's Wi-Fi network directly from

311
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,400
the device to get started users click on the EarthLink Wi-Fi logo in the connections menu.

312
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Hmm, I wonder if you have to buy it through buying it through EarthLink then.

313
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Hmm.

314
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Okay, so cool.

315
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,400
I know they have a similar deal with the cloud in the UK and that works throughout Greater London.

316
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,400
In fact, there's even a Wi-Fi point for the cloud in the in-gill for actually a couple, I think.

317
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,400
I said, I wonder if it's the same deal. I wonder if it's interchangeable.

318
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,400
So if I go to San Francisco, can I hook up to the EarthLink municipal Wi-Fi?

319
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Awesome.

320
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Oh, let me see.

321
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Simon Powell, I add them listening to the Nylon's comment, Charlie 619er.

322
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Is it just me or is he sounding more and more like Madge Weinstein slash Richard Bluestein by the day?

323
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Seems to be trying to wind you up all the time.

324
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,400
And now what's with all that mysticurium watching you stuff?

325
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Hmm.

326
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,400
On a totally unrelated note, why does the Delta Sierra have a US registration when it seems to be UK slash NL base?

327
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Just wondering if it was bought and registered in the states and then brought over here somehow?

328
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Well, by definition, the the make and model of the of the Delta Sierra is of course manufactured in the United States.

329
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,400
All good airplanes, the consists of sheet metal and rivets, they come from the US.

330
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,400
The sheet metal and rivets guy, by the way, I'm not a composite wing dude.

331
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Not completely convinced about the serious in that regard.

332
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,400
So the registration is a very interesting thing.

333
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,400
And the main reason why mine is an N-redge, which is US based, is to fit with my license.

334
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,400
I have license by the FAA.

335
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,400
So I can fly an N-redge aircraft as piloting command, solo, etc.

336
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,400
I think there are different rules for G and a Dutch registration would be PH.

337
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Not quite sure what those subtle differences are, but I do know that it's a hell of a lot easier to have an N-redge aircraft.

338
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:55,400
And in fact, taking it through to a G or different type of registration, I believe it's a process that sucks.

339
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Or as they say in aviation, the process is done when the pile of paperwork falls over of its own accord.

340
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:10,400
It just makes it a lot simpler for me to do anything I want with an N-redge aircraft on my FAA license.

341
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Oh, I immediately go into pilot error.

342
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Hello Adam, it's Martin.

343
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Hey, GD.

344
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
I've got a bonus podcast.

345
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Just wanted to relate to that little story to you, something that happens to me over the weekend.

346
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,400
And we see the text message from two friends of mine, who are wavering for the weekend,

347
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
down in Grastery for the festival.

348
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Thought to their knees in mud.

349
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,400
And they were welcome on a Saturday morning by my voice.

350
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Now they knew for well, I wasn't there because I'd already spoken to them on the Friday night,

351
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
but Crystal could hear my voice.

352
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Now this is about eight o'clock in the morning.

353
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,400
As you can imagine, they're not feeling very healthy.

354
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,400
At that time in the morning, freezing cold still went from the night before.

355
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
And my voice is booming out.

356
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,400
So they pop the hell out of their tent and tried to figure out where the sound was coming from.

357
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,400
And we realized it was coming from the tent next to this.

358
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,400
It wasn't me in person, of course.

359
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Suddenly, in that tent, was playing on a podcast.

360
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,400
Nice and loud in the middle of the campsite.

361
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
A glass tree.

362
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
How cool is that?

363
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Now this just shows that podcast is really taking off here in the UK.

364
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
The kids at Grastery, they know their music.

365
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,400
And here they are, away from the weekend, see some of the best bands in the world on the stages there.

366
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,400
And what's they playing to entertain themselves when there's no bands playing?

367
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
That's right.

368
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
GD's by size bonus.

369
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,400
When my friends went into do some sales to the people next door and said,

370
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:38,400
We know GD, they actually text me and asked me to send a photo message to them to their mobile phone.

371
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
So they could prove they actually knew me.

372
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,400
They actually got chatting with these people, they had a lot in common.

373
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,400
So GD's, you know, 18 the world, not only in music, but in French, as well.

374
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Yes.

375
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,400
And this is just one more step forward for podcasting.

376
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
It won't be long before I have my own stage at Grasterbury.

377
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Until that day comes, of course, you can catch me five days a week,

378
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,400
monthly through to Friday at biteousbonus.podshow.com.

379
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Oh, and one more thing, drink coke.

380
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Yeah, drink coke, please, please don't mess.

381
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,400
When you buy coke, do get music.

382
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,400
You can win an iPod or free songs on iTunes.

383
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
As Cool GD, I've had a moment like that.

384
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,400
And I agree with you that this is definitely catching on in the UK.

385
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,400
And of course, it's not hard to think that eventually we're going to start, you know,

386
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,400
bursting through and little pockets of interest start to pop up and people are catching us.

387
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,400
So to have that happen, it is awesome.

388
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,400
I remember when I was driving from Amsterdam to Antwerp, and I was actually recording a show.

389
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
And this was in 2004.

390
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,400
All of a sudden someone was honking next to me and it was Raymond,

391
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,400
our buddy Raymond Port, who then held up as iPod and said,

392
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Dude, I'm listening to today's show.

393
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
And I'm like, dude, I'm recording tomorrow's show.

394
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,400
It was another one of those fantastic moments.

395
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Yeah, we got, we got reach, man.

396
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Absolutely.

397
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,400
And the kids, of course, they're always going to be looking to find the coolest.

398
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
And I think that, you know, in a in a strange,

399
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,400
perverted kind of like Herman Monster Way, you're a father figure to them.

400
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
I hope they came out right.

401
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,400
A couple of emails from people who say they're very familiar with Barry from Wattford

402
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
who called him to the show yesterday.

403
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,400
He actually has a, has his own website, Barry from Wattford.com.

404
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,400
And he's been on the late edition with Marcus Briggs stock.

405
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,400
A couple other, that's on BBC Four.

406
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,400
And I thought he was on some television some morning show as well.

407
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,400
And yeah, he's pretty funny.

408
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,400
So he's been, and I do recall now, I actually met with him.

409
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
And he was thinking of joining the show.

410
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,400
So I guess that's a good sign that he's, that he's on the way in.

411
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Oh, my goodness.

412
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
It's going to be pretty busy today.

413
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:57,400
We're scheduled to talk to all of our top shows and producers over the course of the next few days.

414
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,400
So I got to hurry up and prepare for that.

415
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,400
It's, you know, it's time to just give everyone a call.

416
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,400
See everyone's doing see what the gripes are.

417
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
There's always something going on.

418
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm always something we can do to suck less.

419
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,400
And I would encourage you if you, if you'd like to make what we do better.

420
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,400
And I'm not just talking about this show, but any show that you listen to.

421
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
We are doing a massive survey.

422
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
I would like you to join the super panel.

423
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,400
This is a part of that whole suckless campaign.

424
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Go to survey.podshow.com.

425
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,400
And sign up, fill out the survey.

426
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:38,400
I think it's one a month and you're going to be, you know, it's really like doing new movie surveys and stuff.

427
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,400
So you'll be asked to, you know, to listen and to watch different types of advertising and give your feedback and host endorsements.

428
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,400
And really it's just trying to figure out what we can do to make the experience better.

429
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,400
We've already learned one important thing and that has something to do with 60 seconds of stuff.

430
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,400
But we're, you know, happy Monday, Adam.

431
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
What do you mean happy Monday?

432
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
It's hum day dude.

433
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
It's Wednesday here.

434
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,400
It was just wiping my ass when I thought you had fuller scruncher, hit her formal pull.

435
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Nice.

436
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
I'm ready to declare winner.

437
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Holders.

438
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
I have a new question.

439
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Do you standard you sit?

440
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Let me start.

441
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Adam and the folding standard.

442
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
I have one other experiment I would like to do.

443
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,400
www.gotnate.com.

444
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Do you think I should have updated by vlog or even paid good editing for hosting before sending this in?

445
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
To talk.

446
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
And again, happy Monday.

447
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Thank you.

448
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
It's Wednesday.

449
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
I think you should check out code dsc3.

450
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
That'll certainly get you some mileage.

451
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Go dead daddy.

452
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,400
What is this?

453
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:14,400
When it's cold outside, I've got no complaints.

454
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:25,400
I guess it's for you who said what can make me feel this way.

455
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I want to come to my hotel.

456
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Maybe I will need you out.

457
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Me.

458
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
I'm feeling the way you carry yourself, girl.

459
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,400
And I want to get with you because you're the dude.

460
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,400
So if you want to come to my hotel, all you've got to do is how to edit me.

461
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,400
If you haven't, I have some party.

462
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,400
I'm knocking out six in the morning.

463
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
On the morning.

464
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
On the morning.

465
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,400

On the morning.

497
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
On the sun.

498
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400

499
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
