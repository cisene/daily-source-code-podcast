1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I present Pod Show's poet laureate, Melvin P. Louis-Buff.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, this is our red commercial's all-name for the main names in hosting. Go Daddy's the name.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In a condo, in a city by the bay, with a sun is blocked out from other skyscrapers under construction, and no two SSID names can be identical.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There sits the Baker's rack where Adam Curry creates his masterpiece.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's the DSC V53.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass, and the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's Adam Curry.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A world where the good-dead-doing naughty photo-dabbling one leg at a strange wife of an agent pop star is among the illustrious group of sea listers that ABC has lined up.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For the next edition of its hit competition series, dancing with the stars.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is the Daily Source Code, number 553.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you very much.

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We will be with you.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So I'll come home to you this evening.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No one will be glad to see me too.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I've got you on my mind.

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But my thoughts are at a side of the field, but you, every hour, every day of the week.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, and imagine I will feel the next to you dancing slowly on a cheeky cheek.

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's why I'll come home to you this evening.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No one will be glad to see me too.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So I'll come home to you this evening.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No one will be glad to see me too.

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But we're all the good times.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And say to you, say, I'm making the right choice without a doubt.

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We've been together for quite a long time.

32
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Where it seems like forever.

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Girl, that you are mine.

34
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, and all the time, may you give me pleasure,

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
but you must never take it all as deep.

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And when all of those balls and your faces light up,

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
we'll never be there to have a back again.

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The twilight come home to you this evening.

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No one will be glad to see me too.

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

41
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

48
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm inside the fans, and I'm very with you.

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Baby for you.

50
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Suggested by the official Music College of Surgery, Josie Todd.

51
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Right once again, you are, Todd.

52
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Damn.

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Good. Hey, everybody. How you doing?

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Daily source code 553 coming to you from Northern California, from the Curry condo.

55
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It is just Tuesday.

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I once again am I on my west coast schedule,

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and the show is at night, so you can have me in the morning all over the world.

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Tomorrow in Australia, which is today here on the west coast.

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I did not have a very good night's sleep last night.

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
After I did the show, and of course I do some stuff for serious satellite.

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
After I had dinner and everything, and you combine all those things.

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's 1-1-30 in the morning.

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So I went to bed, and around 4-30 this morning.

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You know, I keep the cell phone next to the bed.

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, I use it as an alarm clock, because I find I really trust my E61's alarm clock.

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And I know it's going to wake me up, and it works exactly the way I want an alarm clock to work.

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Very simple.

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And of course, if there's something going on back at the manner, if they need me,

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I want them to go to reach me, and all this time zone stuff makes it really complicated.

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So I just keep the phone near me.

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Um, a text message.

72
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Around 4 a.m., 4.30.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't remember exactly.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And it was a text.

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Actually, I have the, uh, I haven't just grabbed the phone.

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I had the text message.

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll tell you exactly what it said.

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And I can also tell the time when it came in, of course.

79
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's nice.

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, 4.45 a.m.

81
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
From Paul Fenton.

82
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm waiting for the voiceovers for today.

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Can't do squat until I have them.

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Now, of course, Pdub's in Florida.

85
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It was, uh, quarter to eight where he was.

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And I woke up and like, oh, crap.

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Of course, I had done all the work, but I don't know if for some reason,

88
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
didn't transfer to the server.

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know what was going on.

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So out of a dead sleep, you know, like, come on.

91
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll just retreat transfer.

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And then I have to text him back and forth.

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And okay, he got him.

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And then I was like, you know, 5.30.

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And yeah, then the jet lag, the confusion hit me like a ton of bricks.

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But I'm so tired.

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I've only slept 4 hours.

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And then I don't know.

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I ate like a whole plate of Oreos and drank two large glasses of milk and,

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and that worked.

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Excellent stuff sent in by you guys today.

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm really proud of you.

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And I, and I, and I, I sit at my desk during the day,

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and I just smile.

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I just smile to myself as stuff comes in on voice mail,

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
stuff comes in, um, through Gmail.

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I just love it.

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It really motivates me.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It really motivates me.

110
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It really makes me want to do the show every single day.

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm telling you.

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Thank you so much.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And Mark Yoshimode Nemkoff and I have been trying to see.

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We can revive the art of guitar whanking.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
See if we can get people to send in their favorite solos.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Done by themselves.

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Hence the wanking portion of the title.

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And he sent in another, um, another example today of an excellent guitar whank.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Quite a surprising one I have to say.

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Hey, Adam, I got another guitar solo for you.

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And this one, you may be surprised, is from the one and only PW Fenton.

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, that guy.

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Now, a lot of people don't know this.

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But before he became a podcaster and an integral part of the pod show family.

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Pointing.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
PW was a well-known blues musician back in the 1930s.

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Um, back then he used to go by the name of blind Willie Lipschitz and, you know,

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
he'd play around the cat scales and stuff.

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I understand he was very popular with the ladies in being uncut and off.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm just reading from his Wikipedia page.

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But the great depression ended blind Willie Lipschitz's music career.

132
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And it wasn't until decades later that PW Fenton resurrected himself as a blues artist

133
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and formed the band PW Fenton and the second ward named after the wing of the hospital where he stayed at.

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I believe it was the sex offender unit.

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Or maybe that's the first ward.

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The second one being the mental wood.

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm not sure.

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But the one thing I do know.

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's wine it.

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Is motherfucking play.

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
On guitar.

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000

144

145

PW Fenton.

146
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
PW Fenton.

147
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
PW Fenton.

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000

149

150

PW Fenton.

279
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,560
see listeners out there. If you play the guitar, you got tone. We want to hear it. Jazz

280
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:42,040
rock, funk, bluegrass, whatever it is that you play. Send it to us. Send me a clip. You

281
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:48,320
know, like a minute, you playing guitar at House of Tone House of Tone, all one word at

282
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:55,480
gmail.com. And remember, Adam, next time you talk to Pete up, respect him for the guitar

283
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:02,440
playing God that he is. And also because he gave me five bucks to say that. Yeah, I know

284
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,360
how to pick him, don't I? Yeah, that was pretty awesome, Pete. I can always, I always

285
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,000
know when when it's time to give Mark a new project, because he starts emailing me with

286
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,920
a million ideas. And actually, I selfishly, I'm thinking, keep sending in stuff like that.

287
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,800
That was awesome. Very surprising. I did not know that when we, when I hired Pete up,

288
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,280
and I'd never met him. I didn't, I didn't mean to for a year until, uh, I was working

289
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,640
with him for a year until we finally met. That's right. Once in a while, now we do, we

290
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,640
should do that again, Pete up. We need to do another, uh, an 800 Nokia video phone call.

291
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:48,640
I'd love that. Pete up's God one. And I think he has my nav kit, because I was supposed

292
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,520
to receive the developer, uh, an 800 device, the one that is going to spread reports,

293
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:02,720
wide open for, uh, some SSH action, hot SS on H action. And of course, uh, the point being

294
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,240
that, uh, the developers who have already signed up, and there's a couple of them, can SSH

295
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,640
write into it. It's a Linux machine. It runs a version of Debian, all the, what is it?

296
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,760
Amo. Yeah. So you can SSH in, and, um, it has a VNC server. So when you're developing, you

297
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,760
can actually see what the screen looks like when, when you're, you know, when you run

298
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,080
something, it's like the user interface as an example. And you can control it exactly the

299
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,080
way you would, uh, as if the device was right in front of you. It's kind of virtual development.

300
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,400
And, um, obviously, having the GPS nav kit along with it, which is a big part of what Trinity

301
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,000
's supposed to have, uh, to be functional. That's kind of, that would be kind of handy, wouldn't

302
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,280
know. Uh, so I think P.D. I've got my kit, or some kit is stuck still at customs. I did get the

303
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,520
N800, the new one. It's still on the box. I, I'm not going to have time to set it up tonight, because

304
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,600
you know, I got to install the VNC server, I got to install the, uh, was it bare drop share SSH

305
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,960
demon? Whatever the name of it is. So there's still a little bit of work, and I'm going to

306
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,800
set it up and make sure the, the ports are routed when you SSH. I'm going to set it up here at the

307
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,880
condo. So when you, when the developers SSH in, uh, that we routed to the proper IP address, which will

308
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,280
be the, uh, the IP address of the, of the, of the N800. It's going to be cool. I'm really looking

309
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,280
forward to this experiment. Uh, and of course, I still have to wrap my head around the whole Trinity

310
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,560
thing. Wait, wait until you hear what I've got in the update for today. It's really going to

311
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,320
bend your mind. And you just, uh, I'm, I'm so not sure where we're going to take this, but she's still,

312
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:43,440
she's still riding, um, Rosie's been driving around, everything's still fine, uh, and there's

313
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,880
still a conversation going on at the Google group. So, um, I just got to wrap my hands around how

314
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,080
we're actually going to execute on this, because it's just, uh, it's, it's a big one. And I just want

315
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:01,440
to add that I'm having a nice find cup of, uh, fold your coffee year this evening. Uh, just the regular

316
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,120
blend, no, uh, no flavor for me, just with a little bit of milk and a little bit of sugar.

317
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,880
Do you recall, uh, I think it was a comic strip blogger who called it, a good friend C. S. B.

318
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:18,480
Talking about the U.S. wanting to deploy, um, I guess medium range missiles in the Czech Republic,

319
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:26,000
in order to, uh, to target Russia was, was not the deal. And, like, some controversy going on with that.

320
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,320
Well, I asked if anyone from the Czech Republic could call me and give me their feelings about,

321
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,040
you know, the whole thing of basically being used as a, as a, as a launch pad for the U.S.

322
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,800
and kind of sitting in the middle. And, uh, low and effin behold, we have a daily source code listener

323
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:48,720
in the Czech Republic. Hey, I'm, uh, I just finished listening to DSE5551, where DSEB talked about, uh,

324
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,440
those stations that Americans want to build, built in Poland and Czech Republic, those anti-mission

325
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,240
missile silos. Um, I am from Czech Republic, and I have just one thing to say, I don't want any

326
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,680
fucking American radar in my country. We are small country, and we mind around business, we don't,

327
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:17,440
the mess with, uh, and a terrorists, and we have never, ever had problems with them, and I don't want

328
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:24,480
to make our country target just because some American radar, which brings completely nothing to our

329
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:32,480
country. Um, Russians, you know, you should mind your own business. Yeah, that's a lot wanted to

330
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,040
say, take care of them. If right, I'm in, yeah, we don't want no fucking radar activated, the anti

331
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:45,120
missile shooting down devices in our backyard. I'm down with that, man. Absolutely. And if there's

332
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,720
anyone who thinks that it should be there, let me know, too, but I'm pretty sure we're going to

333
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,600
get the same type of response. You know, it's just so good to hear a human voice, put a frickin

334
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:01,040
face on these people that we hear about in the news. And you know, uh, uh, I mean, what kind of,

335
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,440
what kind of visual do you get when you think of someone from the Czech Republic? As an American,

336
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,720
please, I just want you to think about it for a second. What is the vision when you think of the

337
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:22,560
Czech Republic? Do you think cell phones, iPods, uh, BMWs? Do you think that? Exactly. You'll see

338
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,040
that the world is kind of caught up with a lot of this stuff. Hey, there's a new, uh, in the

339
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:33,280
attic of which, of course, uh, is the show with Pete Townsend, his beautiful and jealous voice,

340
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,480
girlfriend, Rachel Fuller. I'm so in love with her. She's so cute. She's wearing a really cute

341
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,400
outfit in this episode. There's a new episode up which would have been the last episode of

342
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,320
in the attic, but, um, the show is so popular and so successful that we're going to do some bonus

343
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,040
episodes while we work on another series. It's really awesome. And in this last one,

344
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,760
which Rachel actually even announces as the last one, but, you know, then we're able to cut into

345
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,040
a new announcement of her saying more coming soon. Yeah, that's one of those deals. Um,

346
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,440
Tracy Alman stops by and I was just dumbfounded about how cool this is. So they're the back of

347
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,760
their air stream trailer and Pete is fantastic in this episode. Uh, he plays a number of songs

348
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,640
and he's out. They're signing autographs. And so now they're, uh, they're in the, in the air, uh,

349
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,640
air stream with Rachel and Tracy Alman drives by and they start talking about, uh,

350
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,000
wankers. So this is really for our, for the UK listeners. Uh, they also start talking about Pete

351
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,080
from Big Brother and his, uh, his wanker to ret moments. Check out. Check out. I love the

352
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,560
role in the attic. It's making boys. You get you as a lot of boys, boys. We're a bit

353
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,840
smelly. Yeah, I know. I couldn't talk about what they talk about willys and stuff.

354
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,920
Wanky and a little wanky, wanky, wankers. Yeah, I'm, if that's like on, uh,

355
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,880
they call the Pete a lot of Pete or Pete. So as I'm in England, I'm totally, and I still

356
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,880
come back just to want to watch the original song contest. But that's been hijacked by the

357
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,320
Stan countries. What about the book? What about the book? What about the staff has

358
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,040
extent and stands and it's like the stands. Who's the biggest song? Yeah, the stands.

359
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,720
Strictly girls don't say. I love, I like Big Brother. Pete's from here, isn't he? That

360
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,920
blood were to rest. Yeah, yeah, he's from Brighton. Oh, and he's that fancy and he's nice. He's got

361
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,280
yeah. He's got a little bit wider and he's got to rest, which is very trendy now. It's got

362
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,720
to rest, which is very trendy now these days. And everyone's in a while. He says it a really appropriate

363
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:38,400
moment. And he goes, yeah. And I like Nicky that go. They just talk like this. I am so

364
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,400
poor. I'm worried. And then I think Brava, I've got to have lots of water. Now,

365
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,720
you're the winner. She's totally doing an awesome Nicky. Now, if you haven't seen the UK

366
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,640
big brother, this won't mean much to you, but it's very, very funny segment. And then I'll just

367
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,280
play the little piece of this because this is actually a song on the Podsake Music Network.

368
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,200
Uh, by Rachel Fuller, you can look her up. And it's a life performance with her and Pete.

369
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,600
Let me just, uh, fast forward to it. And I didn't realize that this is the actual recording from the show

370
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,160
that she's put on the PMN. And it's beautiful. It's just Townsend with an acoustic guitar in the

371
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:29,200
foreground and Rachel in the background. Listen, that voice, man. And you got to see Pete.

372
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,320
It's just totally, totally into it. And the way you can see him is the fantastic. It's just

373
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,680
fucking genius. Oh, okay. So that's a shitty, uh, shitty quality. So I don't want to play that for you.

374
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,640
Um, you know what it's time for? Hold on a second. I got a little bit of music here.

375
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,440
I thought I had some music. There we go. Uh, it is time for Adams, a track from Adams first,

376
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,960
Jen iPod. I knew segment we're trying here on the Deadly Source code. Uh, you might have one of these,

377
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,040
you know, the very first iPod you got. You filled it up to the max. And instead of managing your, uh,

378
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,880
your tunes as you would supposed to be doing, you got another one. So I gave you one. And you

379
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,440
start filling that one up. And so this is from 2004. And it has, uh, just tons and tons of stuff on it.

380
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,280
And it's not all just music. And what we're doing is, uh, let me just grab my wire here. Hold on a second.

381
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,960
I've got to put it. I'm literally, oops. Hold on. I've got to put it on pause.

382
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Okay. So now it's set up. Let me, uh, go to the next track.

383
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,840
So you have no idea what it could be. It could be anything at all that pops up. And hopefully

384
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,040
I'll be able to put it into some kind of context. Yesterday's, uh, song, uh, was its swing swing swing.

385
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,360
I had no idea why that was on my iPod. I don't remember recall putting it on.

386
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,480
I've no idea where it came from, uh, but a lot of people recognize it. And as I saw in the,

387
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,320
in the comments in the show, no, it's a lot of people liked it, too. So let's see,

388
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,360
what does Adam's first gen iPod bring us today?

389
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:28,480
It's something called star-frosh. Revolution something or other. It's a first gen iPod.

390
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,600
You know, I got to wait for this thing to scroll by, so I've actually see what it says.

391
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,320
I don't know if I like this.

392
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,760
I was going to drive me up to freaking wall. Okay. Uh, one of the rules of another track from

393
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,760
Adam's first gen iPod is if I hate the track, I get to choose another one. So it's on random.

394
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,400
Let me go to the next track. Let's see what we get.

395
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:15,680
Oh, man. We look out. We get some friends. Yeah, some cinnamon girl.

396
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,200
From Adam's first gen iPod.

397
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,200
Never before that day.

398
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Tell him the same light.

399
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

400
00:26:30,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

401
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:30,400
yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

402
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,600
From Adam's first gen iPod, it's Prince in the Revolution.

403
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,000
No, it's not even where the Revolution is, Prince,

404
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,240
from musicology, cinnamon girl.

405
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,480
And, you know, you can really tell the difference between a quality recording

406
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,120
and the one that I have on the first gen iPod.

407
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,560
So, in fact, I don't even recommend you buy this track from iTunes.

408
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,960
I recommend you go out and get the CD.

409
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm played on a CD player with some decent speakers because, you know,

410
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,960
it's really going to really going to be worth it.

411
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,800
Let me just grab the, uh, you'll plug there.

412
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,040
Okay. Interesting. Interesting with popped up on Adam's first gen iPod.

413
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,480
I hadn't expected that one. There's a lot of old stuff on there too,

414
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,760
just we haven't gotten to it yet, I guess. Remember, it's on shuffle.

415
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,720
So, it's all, uh, well, being done completely fairly.

416
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,080
Well, we've got some good calls today.

417
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,520
Time once again to get the old girl rolling.

418
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
Driving across the USA.

419
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Open and make a good time today.

420
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,560
I feel like I've better watch a girl letting everybody know

421
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,200
that this is going to be the better way.

422
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,200
The Trinity, Trinity, the Christmas Central Luxury, Trinity, Trinity,

423
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,040
left the bio diesel set you bring, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity.

424
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Well, we have one Mercedes 300 turbo diesel station wagon that runs on vegetable oil,

425
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,760
better known as bio diesel. You know, the kind of stuff you're making garage,

426
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,120
or the bio fuel-oasis and Berkeley, California, where I have been before.

427
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,320
And we want to drive her across the USA.

428
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,520
And why, well, first of all, because we can and secondly, because we can do it all

429
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,200
without the dependence upon the big oil companies and it's damn fun.

430
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,280
And we're going to make it a kind of a technology project and a friendship project.

431
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,840
A community project, if you will.

432
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Yesterday, I received a call from someone who I called an echo terrorist

433
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,760
who called himself a nylon being from New York and London.

434
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,400
I didn't know that that was an actual, uh, an actual description of someone who

435
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,440
commuted back and forth, but I guess it makes sense if you're in banking or whatever, nylon.

436
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,640
And uh, I came down pretty hard on him because I felt that he was accusing me of

437
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,680
making this whole green thing. And of course, it's not. It's about independence from foreign oil

438
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:10,160
and from big companies and, you know, I think Trinity somehow is, she's a symbol, not just the

439
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,840
car, she's, why she's an icon. Anyway, dude calls back. Here's what he has to say.

440
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,440
Hey Adam, this is the nylon from Wilburton. And in fact, that is a common term,

441
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,240
you wouldn't get New York magazine here. I want to appreciate to play in my message,

442
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,880
but a couple of corrections for you. Um, I happen to be welcome with the walk as I was.

443
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,640
That's why I should listen to your shows. That's why I may have found it like I was in a hurry.

444
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,280
A couple of corrections, one, one year old show you told everyone that you're going to be in

445
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,000
Twitter and encourage them to listen to you. So I listen to you and Twitter. That doesn't

446
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:50,160
make me a Twitter listener. Of course, they. Okay. All right. I'll give you that one.

447
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,000
Or someone going on a course. Indeed, I'm over in this country because they used to work for

448
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,480
the beloved oil company. In your native land, well, I guess, nevertheless, if in your native land

449
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,840
and approve it, I can still mispronounce, they would make it. Yeah, that would be safeening it.

450
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,120
Okay, interesting. So the guy either worked or works for big oil. Well, okay, the plot thick

451
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,280
I'm so quite out of the environmentalist. I, in fact, can give you some geophysical aspect of the

452
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:25,680
industry that you're trying to free yourself from. So that's wrong. Two, I would hope that you're

453
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:32,320
more inclusive and that just because someone has a different point of view point than you,

454
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:42,160
that you don't label them as part of some environmental backlash terrorist group. I'm into it.

455
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,840
Well, first of all, as nothing to do with inclusion, I included you. I'm including you again.

456
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,800
I'm just calling you a name. That's all. It's cool. Who has happened to listen to your show?

457
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,600
And so that the bio diesel was kind of a walk like a dot, talk like a dot sort of thing,

458
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,560
that you're in fact work promoting environmental agenda, which you still really are.

459
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,560
And finally, I do listen to all your shows. So this was not a one-off. I fused a

460
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,320
get into this kind of logical habit of what I do in the toilet. So that would have given

461
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,760
a different clue. But anyway, I appreciate you playing it because that's a lot. But I think you

462
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,200
did make some think of the assumptions because I disagreed or had a different perspective from you.

463
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,880
See you soon. So I listen to that and I'm thinking, okay, I still don't get it. Where did the green

464
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,240
thing come from? I've never, I've never talked about this as a green project. I just haven't. So

465
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,600
yeah, okay, apologies. But I just understand. Here's a guy who clearly listens to the show.

466
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,440
He listened to me on Twitter because I told him to listen to, you know, to go listen to me

467
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,720
on Twitter. I appreciate that. So I must be mistaken. Somehow I'm coming across

468
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,840
differently than I intend to, that the free Trinity project has something to do with greenness.

469
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:06,240
One, you know, I agree. There's a lot of reasons you can say this is not a green project at all.

470
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,800
And then it started to kind of become clear. It started with this voice mail from the UK. So

471
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,280
get ready to switch your gears and tune into a English accent.

472
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:36,480
At any point where you might ever be confused, there's a thing to admit. You said, just say the world,

473
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:44,240
say the world and that. Are you getting this? I know it's really hard and it's sometimes very

474
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:51,840
hard to go from an American accent to a real British accent. What he's saying is he feels that

475
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,800
people may be confused by the theme tune, particularly the ending. Well, you know what, let me,

476
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,000
yeah, let's do it officially then. The ending would just go something like this.

477
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,400
Trinity, Trinity, because essential luxury, Trinity, Trinity, let the bio diesel set you for your

478
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:19,040
country. Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, free Trinity, save the world, win valuable prizes, Trinity.

479
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,280
Right. Save the world. Okay. So now it's starting to make some sense. All righty.

480
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,640
Okay. So I apologize to the nylon. But, you know, the theme tune is so good and this saved the

481
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:41,520
world thing. Maybe we should specify. Save the world from, save the world from scrunchers.

482
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah, I'm stuck, Pilgrim. Listen to how it changed to pick a baron. I don't want to play that one yet.

483
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,160
Yes, it is. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, pilot error again. This is what I wanted to play.

484
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,800
Hey, Adam. This is the nylon from mumble to. And, in fact, that is a cough wrap. That's not the one. Oh,

485
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,640
no. Well, on a second. Oh, I'm so sorry about this. Here we go. This is the one I wanted to play.

486
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,720
It's awesome. Check it out. You're a lad. I'm the slave from the York. How you doing? Hey,

487
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,160
uh, okay. I was listening to the DSC 552 when I heard the audio comment with a guy derived

488
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,640
into the free Trinity project and you personally about not being green and I had to call you.

489
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,480
After I was wondering too about how all the drivers were going to get home and how the whole thing was

490
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,520
going to look while we tried to make a statement about alternative energy. Well, check it out. I think I

491
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,360
found a solution. Look at terrapast.com and tell me what you think. It's a program where you could buy a

492
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,800
pass that can't so that your personal carbon footprint by funding renewable energy projects.

493
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,080
Kind of like a Kyoto protocol for you and me. I think we should get one of these terrapastes

494
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,640
for Trinity and have anyone who drives a vehicle connected with a free Trinity project. Get one, too.

495
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,560
Shit, maybe we should try to get all the DSC listeners to get one, huh? That would show him how green we are.

496
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,840
I mean, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem, right?

497
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,000
Okay. See ya. Love ya. And, uh, though I swing both ways, it's more fun to say.

498
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:19,120
Scruncher. Oh, girlfriend, please. So, I don't know if you know about this or how this works.

499
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,400
But it is indeed a fact that I believe it's countries and the countries and I'll

500
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:36,480
turn that over to companies. You can essentially, you build up a credit of points and these points

501
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,200
are for CO2 emissions. How many emissions you can throw into the air? And this thing has become

502
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,440
a tradable commodities. It's fascinating is what it is. It's so, I mean, I love it. You know,

503
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,000
you watch, you'll be trading water before too long. Uh, we already are. I'm sure we're already

504
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,080
trading water. But anyway, um, I received an email from Doug Pilgrim. And I remember Doug is the guy

505
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,160
who wanted to come out to San Francisco with his son and drive back to Boston with Trinity,

506
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,160
which got this whole thing started. And of course, we're coming a little bit full circle.

507
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,400
Back to the original idea, just for simplicity, sake, and for quality of programming, sake,

508
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:25,200
and uh, and also quite honestly, for some green sake, because it's, what a, what a nightmare

509
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,960
trying to, uh, have a different driver every 100 miles or something like that. It's, it, it just

510
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,800
will not work. Very, very difficult. So anyway, Doug Pilgrim sends me an email. Good morning,

511
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,560
Adam. I bought Trinity a gift. Seems like everyone wants valuable prizes from her. I thought I

512
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:49,760
would give her something. This is an energy REC or renewable energy credit for native energy. This

513
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:56,000
will compensate for any CO2 that might be emitted on our voyage when straight 100% biodiesel is used.

514
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:09,680
This covers two tons of CO2 or 4,467 miles worth of petrodiesel or 22,337 miles of B20 diesel.

515
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,280
Please place a copy of this with the car before she drops lines. So, and he sent me this,

516
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,120
this printable document. And it's absolutely true. Trinity is now green for 22, well, more.

517
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:28,480
But I'll just say, since we're doing 100% biodiesel. And, you know, there's a pretty high number

518
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:36,720
for the B20, which means 20% biodiesel, 80% petrochemical based biodiesel. Let's just say 25,000 miles

519
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,920
of credit. What a fantastic idea. And, Dave, New York, you guys are all geniuses over there on

520
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,200
these coast. You and Doug is fantastic. I love this. So, of course, this is, this is, we're going

521
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:56,080
to incorporate this into into the project. And, let's promote the purchase of this. This is great.

522
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:03,440
And, I know it sounds kind of like a mathematical trick. But, you know, you couldn't, you

523
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,280
couldn't basically buy yourself greener. It's very simple to do. You buy one of these renewable

524
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,640
energy credits. And, you, and somewhere in the world, less CO2 will be emitted into the atmosphere,

525
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:22,800
into the air, because you put down your money for that, because you bought that, you bought that

526
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,200
right to reduce CO2 emissions somewhere. And, of course, you don't have to have a car to buy that.

527
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,160
So, we could, that's, that's a metric that's interesting. How many thousands of miles

528
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:47,200
we have made CO2 free or how many tons of CO2? I mean, this thing that Doug bought is two tons

529
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:55,600
of CO2. That sounds pretty impressive. I'm really, really liking that idea. So, give me a few more

530
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,920
days to flesh this out in my head, but I'm getting pretty close. We're getting the technology

531
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,280
piece together. I still haven't even gotten back to Paula Walter, podcaster, Barbara,

532
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,800
for figuring out what role she's going to play and how we're going to manage this.

533
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:17,680
But, I do know that I'm really leaning towards the friendship love ankle of this as well. I'm

534
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,280
such a sucker. Listen to what Doug Pilgrim sent in. You remember, he came up with this

535
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:30,240
cock-a-ma-ma-ma idea while his son was off at sea. And his son, Brock, came home. Well,

536
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,560
I'll let Doug tell you the story. Hey, Adam, it's Doug Pilgrim. Listen to how it changed to pick

537
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:41,360
up Brock. Yesterday, my son, he just got back from two months on board his ship down the Caribbean.

538
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,520
And, uh, played some excerpts from all of the free Trinity discussions that have been going on

539
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,840
the daily source code. And, uh, I got in very interesting, uh, candid reaction from the kid afterwards.

540
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:03,840
And I thought I'd share that with you. No way. What's, what's the deal? What do you think of that?

541
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:11,360
I think one, what, I'm, I'm, wow. Well, I just think about doing something. Go on a San Francisco,

542
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,320
I'm picking up a car and driving it back. That's, that's completely awesome. I think that's

543
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,520
incredible. The miraculous, for example. We're all astronauts at the interspace. Why don't

544
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:34,080
pursue it? Yeah, they drug test you. Oh, did he call back? What do you say? What do you say?

545
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:43,680
What do you think about that so far? So far, you're on board. Yeah. So you can imagine the reaction here

546
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,040
at home. Uh, and I kind of, uh, understood it coming from a kid who's been hanging out with the

547
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,240
Rostafarians down the Caribbean. Mom wasn't as understanding though. She, uh, she immediately ran

548
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,640
out and hopped in the car and drove down to the local pharmacy for a drug test for the kids. So,

549
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:07,920
um, it was interesting times here, uh, back at the house after that one. Hey, teenagers, what are you going to do?

550
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,360
Yeah, I know. Tell me about it. But, uh, I think your wife probably went to get the drug test for you

551
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:20,000
dug your idea. Okay. You know, that really seals it for me. I got to have you guys driver across

552
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,920
the USA. There are a couple of spots we got to hit though, uh, because we do have, um, a lot of different

553
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,520
spots on the map. And I, if you guys only have a week, it may be too short. So let's see if,

554
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,880
how much time you actually, um, you actually have. And we got to put some time in there in case,

555
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,960
uh, something happens. And did you show your son a picture of the car?

556
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:48,160
So, um, once she's in Boston, I think we have, uh, aren't there's, remember the two girls who, um,

557
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,600
who want to see each other, the two girls with, with no man?

558
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,560
Right. We definitely got to send her up there. You know, and, and then all podcasters,

559
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,320
and so everyone will be able to make some good shows and send it back. And, uh, yeah, yeah,

560
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,360
I, okay, and even so, um, there are a couple of cities. I want to, I wanted to go to Seattle.

561
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,840
I'd like her to go to Portland. Um, I don't think we'll be able to go into Canada, but if we

562
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,640
get her around the world, we're coming back through Canada, that's for sure. And of course,

563
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,400
the intent is to get her over to the, to the UK after, uh, after the East Coast. Uh, let's see,

564
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:34,320
we'd probably want to hit Chicago. We'd probably want to hit, um, maybe Dallas, Dallas, Chicago,

565
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:39,360
or something like that. Okay. So it's starting to form in my mind, but I, you know,

566
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:46,320
really the whole buddy movie idea, father, son, uh, girlfriend girlfriend. This is tournament.

567
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,280
I like this. This is going to be cool. Okay, everybody. Uh, that's it for today. If you're in the UK,

568
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,760
I would certainly appreciate it if you gave us a call, or if you're close to the UK phone exchange.

569
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,360
Lock this in your mobile.

570
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:11,360
Plus for four, two, seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three.

571
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,840
So we put that plus in there because you're supposed to store this number in your cell phone,

572
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,680
or as we say in the UK, your mobile, your mobile. So wherever you go in the world, the number will always,

573
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,320
have the right, uh, and correct prefix and dial without adding any additional numbers. If you're in the

574
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,960
U.S., be prepared to lock this into your phone.

575
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,200
God, that's annoying. I have at least you remember it, right? Okay, uh, plenty to do tomorrow.

576
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,560
So I'm going to get out of here. I'm going to go to bed and you all have, uh,

577
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:02,000
yourself a fantastic Tuesday. DailySourceco.com, Adam and podshow.com. Take care of yourself,
