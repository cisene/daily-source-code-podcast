When the sun's coming up, you can't sell the riddle

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,280

But taking a very good thought, it'll be an idea

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,400
You can't let the money go

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
Back now, I've got the old one

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,040

00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,600
When the sun's coming up, you can't sell the riddle

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,280
We'll look at the media, I might've got the old one

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,080
When the sun's coming up, you can't sell the riddle

52
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:07,560
saw it out by a massive town dot com a place of link a daily source code dot com hey everybody how you doing how you doing it is monday perfect way to kick off a

53
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:16,760
Monday it is uh well it's uh about 50% beautiful today here in the UK and 50% really crap Christina called from new key where she's still on her

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:28,360
her um um post graduate getaway it's pissing down all day they're at the beach so they're basically indoors and having a horrible time and it's cold

55
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
we feel so bad for those kids

56
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,680
uh boy anyway um the my weekend was pretty food bar didn't really all was because of the weather

57
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:46,600
uh it was just a cascading series of horrible events dominoes toppling over and it really was because initially

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,880
I was going to pick Patricia up in Rotterdam on Saturday the weather wasn't all that hot

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,120
in fact it really sucked over there even though it was much better in the UK

60
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,240
and so we decided to do it on sunday um so you know of course I did my my food bar catch up on

61
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,280
Saturday so I knew that I would have time Saturday and uh you know there's something really weird with

62
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:16,360
Casplaster which I don't think is Casplaster's fault by the way but sometimes um either when the computer goes to sleep or it shuts down

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,120
it basically messes up the dot i and i file of Casplaster and then it can't find things

64
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,680
and even if you restart it the file is then I think saved in uh in a food bar state

65
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,640
uh for those of you new to the show food bars and acronym for fucked up beyond all repair

66
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,200
or recognition your choice

67
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,880
you know so then you have to basically create a new i and i file for Casplaster and it's a it's a

68
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,160
it's a pain in the ass and it could be something that's loaded on my machine that is messing

69
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,520
that up I had no idea but I would suspect that the way it shuts down or goes to sleep or if it's

70
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,160
something exits abnormally then that's when Casplaster doesn't get all the way through writing

71
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,360
its file something like that and I have noticed by the way sometimes it seems like my what I'll just call

72
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,920
the finder so my desktop sometimes not often though but maybe once or twice a week an application

73
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,200
can't find a file until I like click on that file or click on the desktop it seems like maybe

74
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,600
something's going to sleep somewhere and it can't find its file path so I don't know it's uh

75
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,000
it's not really horrible but what does happen is you know then Casplaster has a problem

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,200
then I got to go reconfigure things set it back up copy a backup i and i file it and you all the

77
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:33,960
stuff has to take place and then I test it and I tested you know you know how I tested i tested

78
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,400
by doing test one two one two in fact the only thing I haven't done yet is test test test

79
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,400
to call but essentially I'm testing and then I always forget I should have a checklist but I always

80
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,280
forget to stop and actually no I hit record but if it's recording already and you hit record it

81
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,160
doesn't do anything it just keeps recording so I should hit stop and then record and so I apologize

82
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,080
and and the clues are there I just sort you even hear me in the show say damn I can't believe

83
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,680
you've been recording for like over an hour now it's going on with that well of course 15 20

84
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,360
minutes was all that checking stuff at the beginning so I'm not doing it on purpose I'm just a

85
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:17,320
doc I apologize and so then Casplaster fake you know faded out again or my computer messed up

86
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,720
and you know then I had to upload through the to the web browser upload not a problem then

87
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,200
podshow crashed oh man you know halfway during the upload and so I couldn't upload for a while

88
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,120
and then I did and finally it was upload and I had been deleting you know the wrong episode

89
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,200
went up I don't know how that happened I I'm sorry it was it you know so all of that's taking place

90
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,240
finally everything's you know is all steady didn't secure and everything's working and then the next

91
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,960
morning I got to get a burly to go get Patricia knowing that the day after she came home

92
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,720
we were going to go to the Genesis concert we were invited by my friend Gavin and his wife

93
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,320

Saturday it would have been the day after which would have made it Sunday so we completely missed the entire show

112
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,440
give you the thanks for making me such a proud american after listening to the 4th of july special

113
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,280
you did because you know what you finally made it clear to me what it is to be an american

114
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,280
american i'm a first generation american board mexican and you really summed it up to me by saying

115
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,960
that if you're willing to work hard for yourself then this line for you the really is no limit

116
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,320
what you can achieve if you're willing to work hard at it and after watching that movie about the

117
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,480
health care system and all the fokk up things that the president does you know the war in

118
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,200
Iraq letting levy go free i started to think that maybe i should go vote with with my feet and

119
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,200
move to another country but after hearing about your grandfather banging away at his

120
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:45,800
typewriter writing to his congressperson i realized that i have no reason to go you know i always

121
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,600
get upset when people don't tell me my mistakes and therefore i'm unable to take corrective action

122
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,080
yet isn't that exactly what i'm doing with america i mean i just got to speak up

123
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,040
so you know what i'm gonna do i'm actually going to write to my congressperson and tell them

124
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:12,520
that they need to support the internet equality act you know hr2060 or else i'm just not going to

bottle of koke yesterday i did some shopping so we would have a little more in the fridge when

147
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,720
Patricia came home because believe me that's on the wife comes home to checklist you better have

148
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,600
that box ticked off get some stuff for the fridge and you know cat and dog food and all that

149
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,200
said does it doesn't matter if you've been feeding like scraps and shit all week but when your wife

150
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,240
comes home you want to have uh everything nicely stock so she thinks that you've been taking care of stuff

151
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,400
um yeah but i i i too was like oh you know i should actually take a look

152
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,440
i haven't redeemed the code yet but so there you go do it early in the morning or late at night

153
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,560
and you have i guess i don't know i don't know that makes any difference if you really have more

154
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,440
chance of winning it seems like it wouldn't matter for their systems uh but you know ever since

155
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,560
we've been talking about this now people are getting into it and a lot of interesting

156
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,920
information is coming back uh coming back about this promotion um and how it works

157
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,640
hello Adam you are asking for some feedback with regards to the uh kokekota promotion

158
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,040
that's currently running and um i have to admit that there's so many different promotions that

159
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,840
go around these days that you tend to ignore them but do people realise they could be throwing

160
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:30,360
away iTunes songs um i was actually prompted by your call on the 4th of July to uh to have a

161
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,640
look at the bottle of coke that i just finished and peeled off the label and um inside that

162
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:42,520
give you a code now you can do two things you can either send that code off um using a text message

163
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,760
which apparently only charges you the price of the text messages not one of those that charges

164
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:57,320
you a premium rate so if your um if your normal plan has like 12p for a text message then that's

165
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:04,200
it you just you just spend the 12p i don't think that this kind of call um is covered by any free

166
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,160
text messages that you might have in your package so you will be paying at least the price of

167
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,240
a text message to get this uh first one i sent off it get the uh text message come back saying sorry

168
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:24,760
you have one nothing uh so it's 12p that's a bomber there's nothing next one i sent off it

169
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,880
came back with a text message saying congratulation so far it's a nice word to get in a text message

170
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,680
although it's normally followed by congratulations you've won something you really don't want

171
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:42,440
in this case it's a congratulations you've won a uh what you can put a read it from the phone congrats

172
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:49,080
you have one one three song on iTunes and still have two chances to win an 80 gig iPod not

173
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,560
quite sure what that means i'm not really been able to find out the the full terms and conditions

174
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:02,440
it's has here to claim your song visit coca-cola.co.uk slash music

175
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,520
and go to entered by SMS well um i actually did it exactly as it said entered into my

176
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:19,960
internet explorer coca-cola.co.uk slash music and it threw me up my ISPs search engine cannot

177
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,920
find this domain so we've got a bit of problem there within marketing perhaps you can feed that

178
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:33,240
that back to uh to coca-cola how awesome is this so guy here's me talking about the coge promotion

179
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,240
is drinkin' a coge starts looking at the labels wins a song finds out

180
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,520
that sounds messed up and now he's telling us about it i'd say that's pretty you know

181
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,560
something about this advertising thing i'm podcasting is working um but when i stuck a WWE

182
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:59,160
WWE in front of it it then redirected me to music.coca.co.uk and everything from then on was

183
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,400
was quite hunky-dory um it then gave me a link into iTunes and gave me another this this is something

184
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:13,240
i liked it gave me the option to buy either a 79 or a 99p track. i think the 99p tracks are the

185
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:20,680
ones that are DRM free so that could be interesting um unfortunately the track that I

186
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:29,320
toes wasn't available in DRM free so i'm tied into the the Apple player um well i don't know

187
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,760
how how geeky and science fiction you are but i'm sure a lot of your listeners would have

188
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:41,240
watched the recent Dr. who end of series and i absolutely fell in love straight away with the

189
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:48,120
scissors sisters track and of course that's what i download with a little help from pocher

for the preservation to the soundtrack of our lives and brought to you by koko kola

215
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:25,640
hey Adam it's Craig myr calling uh there's a new release of your note nokie 800 firmware

216
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:32,200
it includes a hook for the Skype client interesting one side installed the Skype client

217
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,800
here's my stop working who would say i think i preferred gizmo

218
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,480
but anyway i thought it was a two-note take care i'm thanks yeah i got a note from the candyman

219
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,360
that there's a indeed a new operating system for the nokie 800 internet tablet you know i love that

220
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,200
thing although i have to be honest i've been using the e61 i almost exclusively as of late

221
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,280
and i've really been looking for the right combination of tasks to use the the tablet for

222
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,360
and having Skype on it will be a huge one i'd love to just have one device that has Skype on it

223
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,000
not you know Skype popping up on a million different computers something i can carry with me

224
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,440
slipping my pocket when i'm talking it has they have a great earphone microphone set combination

225
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,840
that's kind of weird though maybe when you reloaded that's when it blew out your uh your gizmo

226
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,360
settings when you when you reloaded the OS or whatever i mean i i'm always afraid of doing that

227
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,000
stuff i really know i got to take at least two hours to sit down and prepare myself to go through

228
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,520
it usually it's fast you know ten minutes i'm done but i always want to have enough time because

229
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,840
i know that i can't put something down if it starts to you know freak up then i got to

230
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,280
i just got to focus on it make it work but it's been pretty seamless with the with the tablet

231
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:53,880
and it also does flash nine now so and and also what was Luke emailed me that uh it also does

232
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,680
windows media wmv files and they have a media center so we're trying to get our podgeos stuff on there

233
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,640
i and maybe it is on there i have to check it uh okay one more comment then the last song of the

251
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:33,160

252
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:42,280
if i could do it all again if i could do it all again yeah maybe i could be better

253
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:56,440
if i could do it all if i could do it all if i could do it all if i could do it all

257
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,120
who are making songs and putting them on the pod safe music network have an idea that i want to

258
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:26,600
propose to the lady Patricia you know she's really been thinking about what direction she wants to

259
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,480
take and she's really excited about singing again and doing stuff and the things she loves the

260
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,160
most by the way is the entire process of making music making records and i'm thinking if you're

261
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,840
out there and you've got a song that you think might fit for her i think that i can probably

262
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,000
convince her if if i had the right material and i could say look here's a whole bunch of songs

263
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,920
and these are you know and these folks are fucking serious and professionals and they want to

264
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,400
work with you we could put something pretty interesting together just the thought

265
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,200
and with that thought i will say talk to you tomorrow bye bye
