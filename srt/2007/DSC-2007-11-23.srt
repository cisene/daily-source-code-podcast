1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,180
Delta's Yaracharly 69 or 1. It's 4v5d

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,780
Mainly 16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped by us

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,960
than the next generation radio contenti my years

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,960
We don't need no sticky drinks, man.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,960
I like to become silent, you too.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
She's trying to kill me.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,960
I'm guessing it's Adam Curry.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
Together.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:58,960
We have you live like this for such a long time.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,960
Do you know that something's a mess, but what you can't find?

11
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,960
I'll do the dirty work.

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Hold up my sleeves until it hurts, man.

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,960
I'll do the dirty work.

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Leave it to me.

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,960
I am the man you need.

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Won't you change your head and get your life back?

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,960
Let's put our heads together.

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,960
I'll do the dirty work.

19
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,960
Hold up my sleeves until it hurts, man.

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,960
I'll do the dirty work.

21
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
Leave it to me.

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,960
I am the man you need.

23
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Won't you change your head and get your life back?

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,960
I'll do the dirty work.

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,960
Hold up my sleeves until it hurts, man.

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,960
I'll do the dirty work.

27
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Leave it to me.

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,960
I am the man you need.

29
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,960
I'll do the dirty work.

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Leave it to me.

31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,960
I'm the man you need.

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,960
I'm the man you need.

33
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,960
I'm the man you need.

34
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Just bring a new monk's dirty work from the pod safe music network.

35
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Hey, everybody.

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
How you doing?

37
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,960
It's been two full days that we haven't spoken and good reason for it because I'm busy.

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
What can I tell you?

39
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Oh, man.

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Of course, two days if you saw my blog entry at curry.com, two days.

41
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Two blissful days of playing with the brand new Nokia N-810.

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Of course, I'll be telling you all about it in this football Friday edition of the Charlie.

43
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,960
I don't know if it's a child's own Londoner.

44
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
I'm just listening to it.

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,960
I think six, six, six, six, eight, six, eight, I don't know.

46
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
You know what?

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,960
I had to call him that fucking idiot.

48
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
I'm calling you lazy.

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Now, I'm not your biggest man.

50
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I'm fucking respect what you do.

51
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
And saying that you're making one out of pod.

52
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
So he clearly doesn't understand business.

53
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
There's no way pod shows making that much money yet.

54
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Certainly I imagine not enough to pay you a wrong yet.

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,960
He's going to be playing back into the business building it up.

56
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Sure, you will make a fuckload if and when you sell it.

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
But that's what it's like at the point.

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
I call you lazy.

59
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Marba, fucker.

60
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
He's just jealous.

61
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
You're jealous.

62
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
It's a small-minded twat.

63
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
You really are.

64
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,960
And if you want one out of go, go round fucking do it.

65
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Jesus Christ.

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
And get something to money.

67
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Take your daughter to school or something like that.

68
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
It's fine back with the force of the state.

69
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Sound like a laugh.

70
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
But I bet that's a real pain in the ass.

71
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Running too fucking offices.

72
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,960
My friend, you are severely misguided in my opinion.

74
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Like I said, like I'm not Adam's biggest fan.

75
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
But I told you respect what he does.

76
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,960
And that's all I have to say about that.

77
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Ooh, got me ruined.

78
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
And stop.

79
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,960
I don't want Marba.

80
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,960
So easy to complain.

81
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Don't change.

82
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Never change.

83
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
I stand along.

84
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Got to change direction.

85
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Don't change.

86
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Don't change.

87
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,960
I stand along.

88
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,960
I stand along.

89
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960

I stand along.

99
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
I stand along.

100
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
I stand along.

101
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960

164
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
I stand along.

165
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,960
You're a fool

166
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
You're a fool

167
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:53,960
You're a fool

168
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,960
You're a fool

169
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Oh, it's all the face I want to dream of now

170
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,960
And you're a fool down

171
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,960
In the strong face, I will be bringing down

172
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,960
And you'll fall down

173
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,560
See the mind, lie down, burning from

174
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,560
But it's hard to escape

175
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Where your flash will walk

176
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,160
With a smile of faith, I will be bringing you down

177
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,960
Because I am my enemy

178
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,960
How for sons, what's the peace?

179
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
And I get damn all yours, take that

180
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,960
Really?

181
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I'm not belong, you're all

182
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
I'm not belong, you're all

183
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
I'm not belong, you're all

184
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
You're all

185
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
There's nothing like a little over-modulated

186
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
microphone in a hard rock and tune

187
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,960
I love that, just a just right

188
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Right, right against distortion, fantastic

189
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Hey, hey, hey, I'm going to San Francisco

190
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
On Sunday, for a week

191
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Not exactly planned that way, but as you know, we're trying to

192
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Close up a couple of the deals before the end of the year

193
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
And you just got to do it, you got to do it

194
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
You got to do it somewhere between

195
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Thanksgiving and December 15th

196
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
If you want to do it in the US, we're also working

197
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Over here in Germany, so it's

198
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
A lot of back and forth because of course

199
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
This is the media business that we're in my friends

200
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
And that shuts down around mid-December

201
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Just stops, you know, people at agencies

202
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Go on vacation

203
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Listeners, tend to go on vacation

204
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Viewers tend to go on vacation

205
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Everything just kind of winds down very slowly

206
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
And then it kicks up again around January 5th

207
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,960
But for business, it just really, really blows

208
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Hey, so I've had two fantastic days

209
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Wednesday, I was scheduled for an interview

210
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
And a photo shoot

211
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
A part of it was being done here at home

212
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
And then we were off to the London office

213
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,960
And actually a day before I expected it

214
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
There was the candy man

215
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,960
He arrived with the red and yellow truck in front of the manner

216
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,960
That meant that the Nokia N810 had arrived

217
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Man, I'm so happy this device turned out to be what it is

218
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Because, you know, I want to sell these things

219
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I want to get you guys a great deal

220
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,960
If you're interested in buying it, it is perfect

221
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
I mean, nothing is no devices ever perfect

222
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
But man, this exceeds even my expectations

223
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Let me see if I can give you a little bit of a description

224
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
about it. First of all, they've taken a

225
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,960
I'd say almost a page from the Apple Playbook

226
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
The way they're packaging this device

227
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
When you open up the box, you know how Apple

228
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
When you open up an Apple thing, it's like porn

229
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
And it says, you know, made for you

230
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
And Cupertino, California

231
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Well, even though it doesn't have any of that

232
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Certainly not a made for you and Cupertino sign

233
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
It's just you open the box and there's the device

234
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
And, you know, it's nicely presented

235
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Much better than I've ever seen

236
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Any cell phone manufacturer do

237
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,960
By the way, do you know the history of

238
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Nokia, these guys are going to weird company

239
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
They used to be in, I think they made paper

240
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
And then I think they made rubber products

241
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Like rubber boots, they're manufacturing company

242
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
And then at one point they decided to go into

243
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
A mobile telephony and cell phones

244
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
And man, they have never looked back

245
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,960
It's a funny, funny, funny company

246
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
So I'm trying to think best

247
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
How to tell you about this device

248
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
I could give you the comparisons between the

249
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
9800 and the 810

250
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
But it's really the closest comparison I can give you

251
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Is between when I had the E61

252
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Which is the

253
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
What a lot of people will call it blackberry

254
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
But it's not, it's a full-quality keyboard

255
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Phone from Nokia

256
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
And then when they came out with the E61I

257
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
It's almost that type of an upgrade

258
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
The device is thinner

259
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
It's smaller, of course

260
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
The big

261
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Different, since it has a slide out keyboard

262
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
Underneath now

263
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
10 does not have a cell phone in it

264
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
But that's not what it's for

265
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
I see this as a

266
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
It's right in the middle of my

267
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Computing triumvirent

268
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
If you will, my communications triumvirent

269
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
So I have my laptop, which

270
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Thank god, I have the MacBook Pro

271
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Man, I'm loving this thing so much

272
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Oh, it loves me back, believe me

273
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Although I must say, my favorite streaming porn sites

274
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Don't work too well, I'm flip for Mac, that kind of sucks

275
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
You know, the native windows on windows media

276
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Play on windows does the streaming porn

277
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Much better if it's windows media

278
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Streaming porn, but that's okay

279
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
I can even even with that problem

280
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
I still love my MacBook Pro

281
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
And she loves me back

282
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
Then of course I have my cell phone

283
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Which is really for me

284
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Having used the iPhone, having used the E61I

285
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
I just really need something that's going to have a

286
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Long, long battery lifetime

287
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
That's not going to last the seven hours

288
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
They apparently work in Cupertino

289
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Because that's how long the iPhone battery lasts

290
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Seven hours, that's it

291
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
And if you're not a near computer

292
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Or you don't have all the appropriate

293
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
You know, wires and dongles and threads

294
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Then it's very difficult to charge and it just sucks

295
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
It's just no good

296
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
You know, the E61 has the camera

297
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
It has the Wi-Fi, it has all that stuff

298
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Now the web browsing experiences of course

299
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Subpar

300
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Compared to the iPhone certainly

301
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Because what the iPhone has with that zoom

302
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
One thing and you know, navigate around a web page

303
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
No one has even come close to that

304
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
And not on the N8010 either

305
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
However

306
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
And maybe this is the best place to start

307
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
With the telling you about this device

308
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
It has a Mozilla browser in it

309
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Which is 100%

310
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
I have not been able to find any flaw

311
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
100% compatible with all of the Google services

312
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
So Gmail works on it

313
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Full browser, full view mode

314
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,960
They've actually fixed the zoom

315
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Feature on the A10

316
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
So when you zoom in it

317
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
It's much faster

318
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
It basically just really zooms in the picture

319
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Or the webpage quick

320
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
And you still have to, you know, navigate

321
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Which you can do with your finger or you can do with the scroll button

322
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
But the cool thing is

323
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
All of the keyboard shortcuts work

324
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,960
And this, oh my goodness

325
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
To sit there and hit J for the next message

326
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Or hit Y to archive something

327
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Or hit C to compose

328
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,960
And then start typing an email address

329
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
And it's actually doing what Gmail does

330
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm a computer and it's starting to give me all the possible email addresses

331
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
I want to reach

332
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Fucking beautiful

333
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Thank you so much

334
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
I was showing Neil Dixon

335
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
I was showing it to Neil Dixon on Wednesday at the office

336
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
I was poking his eye out with it

337
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Ah man he's so jealous

338
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
I love it

339
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Just love seeing him turn green

340
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Kind of what had sales we saw

341
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Chris did to me when he had the zero zero version

342
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
And was poking my eye out with it

343
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
And then Neil said

344
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
Oh, so it doesn't do Google Docs

345
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I hadn't tried yet

346
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
So I tried to Docs.google.com

347
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Completely works

348
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,960
100% beautiful fast snappy

349
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Oh

350
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
That pretty much

351
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Cleansed the deal for me right there

352
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
But there's more

353
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
There is more

354
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Hey Adam it's tonight

355
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
I will from the UK

356
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
I'm sort of reading area

357
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I just posed your podcast

358
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Which I'll be listening to for a while

359
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
That's very much appreciate

360
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
And you just don't about me

361
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,960
It's the M800 series again

362
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,960
Which I greet as like a stomping device

363
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,960
And I'm holding out for a converged one

364
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
All the little things I need

365
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I check out the suggestion

366
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Check it out the

367
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,960
Neil 1973 from FIC

368
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,960
I don't know if you come across this

369
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
It's an open source phone

370
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Where it's all of the other

371
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
But some pieces thrown in

372
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,960
Because I personally hate carrying out two things

373
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
I don't know if I've gone any

374
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Under that I just won't have it with me

375
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
So yeah

376
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
That's it

377
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Oh yeah

378
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,960
Into the guy who's here to fuck you

379
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
To the fuck you Adam Curry site

380
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Just for good now

381
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Say fuck you fuck you

382
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Fuck you Adam Curry man

383
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
So yeah

384
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
And fuck you Adam Curry

385
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Thanks my friend

386
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Very nice

387
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
Most of the applications of the same

388
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Skype isn't working yet

389
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
I think it's supposed to be fixed today

390
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
That's a known bug

391
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
And they're making that work

392
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
Of course Skype is another big part of my

393
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Communications infrastructure

394
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
This device it really fits right in the middle

395
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
You know when I'm sitting downstairs

396
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Or I'm just walking around the house

397
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Or even in the office I just want to

398
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Get something on the web really quickly

399
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Because that's really what I use it for

400
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
90% of the time

401
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
It does have G-talk in there

402
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
And it has a camera built in

403
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
So you can do video conferencing

404
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
I don't think it'll work with the

405
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
With eye chat

406
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Haven't actually tried

407
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
It may

408
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
If you set it up through whatever

409
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Protocol

410
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
It might work

411
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,960
But it really doesn't matter too much for me

412
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
The keyboard is obviously

413
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,960
When you have a tactile physical keyboard

414
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
It's just going to be easier for typing

415
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Less typos

416
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
And of course I have to learn the keyboard

417
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Because it's so it's pretty broad

418
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
I must say that the top row of keys

419
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Are a little hard for me to punch in

420
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Because you're basically hitting up against the top of the case

421
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,960
So the top line of keys

422
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Which in this case is the Q-W-E-R-T-Y

423
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,960
And the numbers are accessed through the function key

424
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
On those keys

425
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Which I use a lot

426
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Use numbers a lot when typing

427
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
It does take a little bit of getting used to

428
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,960
So you're not hitting the key below it

429
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,960
In fact I wouldn't have mind that if it could slide out

430
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Just five millimeters more

431
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,960
It would have been perfect but I'm not really going to complain

432
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Try it on the train

433
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Had my MP3s

434
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
I've loaded up the video center

435
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Which I don't think has been officially released yet

436
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Of course that does have a pod show feed in it

437
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
Videos look beautiful

438
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Sound is fantastic

439
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
The media player

440
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Big improvement

441
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
This of course is also the new operating system

442
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
It's OS 2008

443
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Honestly I just can't say enough nice things about it

444
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
And it's really because

445
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
It's a feel

446
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
You know when you have a device in your hand

447
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,960
And you know how the software reacts

448
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
And how the user interface reacts

449
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
And it can feel

450
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Well it's like windows mobile

451
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Which by the way has all of these functionalities

452
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
They've got fantastic smartphones

453
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
But it just feels

454
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
The cheap

455
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
I don't know what it is

456
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
It doesn't make me feel good

457
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
You know because what does this thing cost?

458
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
400 bucks

459
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
I mean it's not a cheap device

460
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,960
And I'm sure these smartphones aren't entirely cheap

461
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
But it doesn't even matter to me

462
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,960
It's just the feeling of robustness

463
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,960
That it's solid

464
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,960
And that I am in control of the device

465
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
And I'm not waiting after I issue a command

466
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Or click on something to see if it pops up

467
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,960
It seems almost twice as fast

468
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
With some functions

469
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Particularly with the web browser over the N800

470
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,960
I can't say enough nice things about it

471
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Let me give you some downsides

472
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,960
Of course they've gone into miniaturization once again

473
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,960
So the last time they shrunk down a device

474
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Which resulted in the N800

475
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
We wound up with a new ant dick power plug

476
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Which I find horrendous

477
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Because if it drops off the nightstand

478
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Then it's charging

479
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,960
And the ant dick can break off very easily

480
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
It's a really really thin little poker thing

481
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
That you used to charge the device

482
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
I wouldn't have mind of being able to charge it

483
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Through USB port

484
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Of course I'd say that for all of the Nokia devices

485
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
I don't think any of them actually does that

486
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Maybe it's a special cable for it

487
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
But I haven't come across it

488
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
They've also miniaturized the USB port

489
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Which I understand why they do it to make things smaller

490
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,960
But of course now I have one specific USB cable

491
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,960
That will work on this and I can't use the 15 other USB cables

492
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,960
I have lying around my life

493
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Whenever I need one I know I can grab one from somewhere

494
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,960
So you have to now carry the special USB cable

495
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
That bites

496
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Oh and the so it has an internal memory card

497
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
A two gig memory card which is nice

498
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
And then you have an external memory card

499
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Which is accessible through the front of the device

500
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
And guess what?

501
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,960
They've shrunk that one down as well

502
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
So instead of the regular memory card

503
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
I think it's now a mini SD

504
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,960
So all of the data had carefully backed up

505
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
From the N800 onto my card

506
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,960
I of course could not bring back to life

507
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,960
On the A10 because the memory card wouldn't fit

508
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
I hate it when Nokia does that

509
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
It's annoying

510
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,960
It's not the upgrade path

511
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
I was looking for exactly

512
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,960
And of course the beautiful leather at case that I had

513
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
For the 800 no longer fits

514
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
And this device is actually physically thinner

515
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,960
And not quite as wide although the screen is at least the same size

516
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Of not bigger

517
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,960
And that's really those are about the only downside

518
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
You know I'm figuring out the interface

519
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Again, it does not have the beauty of the iPhone

520
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
You know pinch open to zoom

521
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
In fact, Nokia is pretty good at licensing

522
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,960
If that was available I'd tell them to go license that

523
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,960
In a heartbeat because that would make it

524
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
In fact, I saw sales weasel Chris

525
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Showing me something on his N00 device

526
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,960
You know I'm so cool I have mine before everybody else

527
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
And I saw him do a pinch move on

528
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Like dude it's not an iPhone

529
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
He's like oh yeah that's right

530
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
I gotta use this button over here

531
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,960
They're not far off from it

532
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,960
So as I discover more I'll be telling you more about it

533
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Of course

534
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
It's my life from Birmingham in England

535
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
I just thought I'd like to let me know

536
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
I've got one of those

537
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Nokia 810s on order

538
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
For my expenses and I'm looking forward to it

539
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,960
When I do get it and say with it

540
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,960
I'll let you know how I feel about it

541
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
I wish I knew you was going to order some

542
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
And put it out there

543
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Some sort of offer to like I'm going to stick with it

544
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,960
And get one of the only ones and just go with it

545
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,960
I just like the idea of it and it's better to give this into

546
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,960
You talk about the 810 or your previous versions

547
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
So start right, have a play everyone

548
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
So go on and pre-order

549
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
And hopefully I'll get it soon

550
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
I'll get released

551
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
Fuck you I don't care

552
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Yo yo

553
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Thank you

554
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
And let me know what you think of it

555
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Actually I'm going to go to the

556
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
I'll put a link in the show notes

557
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
So you can at least buy one

558
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
I think through Amazon

559
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Let me just see what their price is

560
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Of the device today

561
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,960
It's probably going to take another three or four weeks

562
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
I think before

563
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Before a potchoke

564
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,960
And offered to you at this awesome price

565
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,960
That we've been working on with the folks in Finland

566
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,960
449

567
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
And 99 cents of 450

568
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
So 200

569
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
About 220 pounds

570
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Hey British people

571
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Oh you guys doing by the way

572
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
I haven't heard a lot from you

573
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Of course you got Charles

574
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
A drunken Londoner

575
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
A couple people calling in

576
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,960
But what's going on with you guys

577
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Have you have you gone silent on me?

578
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Is it because 25 million records of

579
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
People receiving child support

580
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Has gone missing

581
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Been stolen from the government

582
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Is that why we're all hiding?

583
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Why we're all being real quiet?

584
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Or is it perhaps because you're waiting for

585
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
The hit test?

586
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
One girl in casting

587
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
With Adam Curry

588
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Hey Adam

589
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Are you ready to be stumped

590
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Because he used that film test

591
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
With young pro men

592
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
Hey Adam

593
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
This is hit test number

594
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
97 and we got to start right away with intro

595
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
Number Rocker

596
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
Number Rocker

597
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
So I'd uh

598
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
That just won

599
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
That's in that zoom

600
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
Not zoom

601
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
But zoom

602
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
I can't remember who was by zoom

603
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Number two

604
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Yeah

605
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
That's right

606
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
It's a rhythm

607
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
It's my girl Grace Jones

608
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Hit me with number three

609
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Young

610
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,960
And the final one is number three

611
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
That one I don't know

612
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,960
I've got one and a half stars at least

613
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Cause I didn't know who did zoom

614
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
And time's up and these are the answers

615
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Answer number one from 1982

616
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Fed Larry's fan

617
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
Larry's fan

618
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Alright

619
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Just one look

620
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,960
And we were on the moon

621
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Lion high

622
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Hit a neon sky

623
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Oh

624
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
So

625
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,960
Change the name

626
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Oh

627
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
What a great song

628
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Fed Larry's fan

629
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Then zoom is answer number one

630
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,960
And this is answer number two from 1985

631
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
Grace Jones and slave to the rhythm

632
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,960
On day

633
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,960
On day

634
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
On day

635
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
To keep the

636
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,960
On day

637
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
To keep the

638
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,960
On day

639
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
On day

640
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
On day

641
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
On day

642
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
On day

643
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
On day

644
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
On day

645
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,960
And this is the third and final order from 1987. Swing out sisters.

646
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
Oh, Render.

647
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Sorry, I don't know this one.

648
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,960
Oh, I'm just quiet.

649
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,960
Swing out sister and surrender as answer number three in hit test number 97.

650
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
So Adam, how did you do?

651
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
I wanted a half star, so yeah.

652
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Anyway, if you want to know how you did in every hit test and what you ever score is,

653
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,960
you have to wait a few weeks because in a few weeks time, I'll have some statistics ready for you.

654
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Oh, that's all I need.

655
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,960
I don't know if you're going to be happy with the end result, but very fair.

656
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
That's probably not true.

657
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,960
Alrighty, the answers to this hit test and also the items linked so you can buy these tricks.

658
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Online can be found at hittest.parcio.com.

659
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,960
The next week I'll be back for hit test number 98.

660
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,960
So until then, take care and bye-bye.

661
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
We'll be back.

662
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Hit test and she will not come in.

663
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Oh, young bullet.com.

664
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,960
J-N-P-O-L-E-T-S-O.

665
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,960
Hey, y'all, and we're moving up on number 100.

666
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
This is fantastic.

667
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,960
As Y'all said, all of these songs can be found at hittest.podshow.com.

668
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,960
And you can click on the iTunes links and go buy them at the iTunes store.

669
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,960
It's a great way to fill up your iPod with the great songs from the soundtrack of your life.

670
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,960
And of course, we're continuing to build our soundtrack to our lives.

671
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
We'll do that together.

672
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
And it's that time again.

673
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
It's the Christmas season.

674
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,960
So it's time for some Christmas songs on the Charlie hand.

675
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960
Which was a night before Christmas.

676
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
My face was a grin.

677
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Because I found free music on the PMN.

678
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,960
A y'all, this is Jeff Smith, from the Podset Music Network.

679
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,960
We should do a Merry Christmas Happy New Year.

680
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,960
That's right.

681
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Hey, buddy.

682
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Send off some nice holiday cheer-art way.

683
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
I'm sending it to your family.

684
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Of course, if you know.

685
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
What do you do?

686
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
One of the things we'll come in.

687
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
I was feeling blue.

688
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,960
And the presents for my family and friends.

689
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Now we'll get to give back its December.

690
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,960
As a sad looking in my room.

691
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,960
My side is sweater from the end too.

692
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,960
And the idea made me like a food to the head.

693
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Going get that sweater to my cousin's head.

694
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,960
I'm reaching for the holidays.

695
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,960
I'm packing up all that crap.

696
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
I'm adding it back.

697
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,960
I'm giving it to someone new.

698
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,960
I'm reaching for that baby.

699
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,960
I'm packing up all that crap.

700
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
I'm adding it back.

701
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,960
I'm giving it to someone new.

702
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,960
Send the bills and some fuzzy dives.

703
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,960
Today I'll be looking at a quarter-old slice.

704
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,960
It's a sandwich maker.

705
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,960
No one in the dark.

706
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,960
You aren't gonna get in there to beat yourself up.

707
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,960
Feel so rich, ray of lads, if I get a boo.

708
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,960
My dark glass around me has struck.

709
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,960
Share my golden CDs.

710
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,960
I'm coming from the misery that we're looking at.

711
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,960
I'm reaching for the holidays.

712
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,960
I'm packing up all that crap.

713
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
I'm adding it back.

714
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,960
I'm giving it to someone new.

715
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,960
I'm reaching for that baby.

716
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,960
I'm packing up all that crap.

717
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,960
I'm giving it to someone new.

718
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm reaching for that baby.

719
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,960
I'm reaching for that baby.

720
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,960
I'm reaching for that baby.

721
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,960
I'm reaching for that baby.

722
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,960
I'm reaching for that baby.

723
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Nothing like regifting for the holidays.

724
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
The Alice project.

725
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
You can find them on the podcast.

726
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Music.

727
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Now working, of course, link in the show notes.

728
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,960
It's a daily source code.com.

729
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Speaking of phones, devices.

730
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
This is pretty funny.

731
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
It's a story about an iPhone.

732
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,960
I've got this in an email from Duke Garin.

733
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,960
I think who works for a major airline.

734
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,960
The link to plainbuzz.com, which of course I'll put in the show notes.

735
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,960
It's a daily source code.com.

736
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,960
This is about passengers with iPhones.

737
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Okay.

738
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
Let me see.

739
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,960
My captain did the lecture over the public address system as they had just pushed back.

740
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,960
And the advice of a ground stop in Memphis due to storms in the area.

741
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,960
Then a minute later, the flight attendant dings up to the cockpit and says,

742
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,960
You know, some guy with an iPhone says the weather's good.

743
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,960
And once know what the real reason is for the delay is something wrong with the plane.

744
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,960
So, you know, what a scenario, right?

745
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,960
And of course, these things happen.

746
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
You can expect that you're on a flight.

747
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,960
You know, someone has an iPhone in the back.

748
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
You're piloting command.

749
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,960
And you say, hey, look, we got to do a ground stop in Memphis for due to weather.

750
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,960
And people are looking up on their iPhone.

751
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:40,960
Of course, getting unsophisticated non-aviation based weather from like weather.com or something or whatever

752
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
The iPhone standard weather widgets are.

753
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,960
And then I guess it may be worried.

754
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,960
So the captain gets on the public address system and says the following.

755
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,960
If the passenger with the iPhone would be kind enough to use it to check the weather at our alternate.

756
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Calculate our fuel burn due to being rerouted around the storms.

757
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,960
Call the dispatcher to arrange our release and make a phone call to the nearest air traffic control center

758
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,960
to arrange our timely departure amongst the other aircraft carrying passengers with iPhones.

759
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
They'll be more than happy to depart.

760
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Please just ring your call button to advise the flight attendant and your fellow passengers when you don't when you deem it ready.

761
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,960
And responsible for this multi-million dollar aircraft that is passengers to leave safely.

762
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Ah, yes.

763
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,960
There's nothing like a good use of the public address system in there.

764
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Adam, hey, the motion on to the California air.

765
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:34,960
Just finished listening to no agenda for and fired up just 690.

766
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Um, what's that, you man?

767
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,960
You and John Vorac came up so perfectly.

768
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:51,960
I'd like to guys have been talking with each other for the last 20, 30 years as a, as a talk radio team.

769
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,960
We have a local team like that that actually simultaneously has been the area.

770
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Um, a local radio station.

771
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,960
And you guys hit it off easily as well as they do.

772
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
I don't know if you've listened to them there.

773
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,960
They're on here in the air and in the area from 6 to 10 a.m.

774
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,960
But, um, just want to tell you, man, no agenda rocks.

775
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,960
And, uh, you need to get a good team for that.

776
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
I don't care if you say there's no team.

777
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
You need a good team.

778
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
But, uh, fuck you.

779
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,960
I'm curry, scruncher, and go home and punch.

780
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
That's amazing.

781
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Right on, man.

782
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,960
I was just actually looking, uh, someone did sent, not a, someone didn't,

783
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
didn't send me a theme song.

784
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,960
I was sent a, um, I can't find it now.

785
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Crap.

786
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
I don't know where it is.

787
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Maybe it's, uh, maybe it's a wave file.

788
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
Hold on.

789
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Let me see what I can find it.

790
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
Yeah.

791
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Yeah.

792
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,960
I sent a John to Vorac and note.

793
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
I can't find it.

794
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
What the hell was up with that?

795
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
I try this.

796
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,960
Let me try my good old, uh, Google desktop search.

797
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Um, I ping them and said, are we doing a show today?

798
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Because, of course, in the States, it's a holiday, um, both today, uh, both,

799
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
yet today and yesterday.

800
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,960
I just see no agenda, no agenda.

801
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,960
Fuck.

802
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
I don't know.

803
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
Someone sent me.

804
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
I know who sent that to me.

805
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
I'll find it.

806
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Maybe I'll use that.

807
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
If not, you know, I don't know.

808
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
It just feels right.

809
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,960
You know, to just start yapping and not have an agenda.

810
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,960
Not have any jingles or anything like that.

811
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,960
And I, uh, I like talking to John.

812
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
And that's really all we're doing.

813
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,960
I, I, I must admit, I forget that I'm actually, you know, recording anything.

814
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,960
We're just talking like we do, uh, when, uh, when we're at the office or if we have lunch or something like that.

815
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
And, uh, and he's a smart guy.

816
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
He's pretty knowledgeable.

817
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
About a lot of, a lot of different shit.

818
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
He keeps amazing.

819
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
He went this stuff.

820
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,960
He knows about.

821
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
And that sent me an email.

822
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,960
And it's just pretty weird.

823
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,960
I have not received one of these, but apparently, number of people are getting messages from Skype.

824
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,960
Telling them that their London Skype in number is changing.

825
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Which is fucked up.

826
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Here's an exact sent me a sample of the email.

827
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Hello.

828
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
I love the way Skype brought the talks to their customers.

829
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Hello.

830
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Customer.

831
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
Customer.

832
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,960
We're very sorry to tell you that we have to change your Skype in number.

833
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,960
As some of you may know, apparently, only the smart customers.

834
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,960
We get Skype in numbers from a variety of telecom suppliers.

835
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Unfortunately, we have to return some of the O2O7 Skype numbers to one of our suppliers of London numbers.

836
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,960
This means your number will stop working from December 20th, 2007.

837
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,960
We apologize and realize the inconvenience this will cause you.

838
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Again, we sincerely apologize.

839
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
How lame is that?

840
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
I don't have a, do I have an O2O7?

841
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Let me see.

842
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
What's my number again in the UK?

843
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
I can't quite remember.

844
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Let's see if it's O2O7.

845
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Okay.

846
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Crap.

847
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:58,960
161, 3753, plus 44, 207, 161, 3753.

848
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Well, that sucks.

849
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
I guess my number is changing too for the UK.

850
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,960
What does that, it's a Korean new jingles then.

851
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
This is an outrage.

852
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Why have I received a message about this?

853
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
Skypeers?

854
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Oh, this is not good.

855
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
Let me see.

856
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Matt says, I've had the same number for over two years.

857
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
And use it for business quite a bit.

858
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Now they give me one month's notice.

859
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Following the recent 2007, no.

860
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,960
Following the recent O2O7 outage, oh, I guess there was a problem.

861
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,960
Some people did call it and say there was a problem with the UK number.

862
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,960
Following the recent O2O7 outage, this company is turning into a joke.

863
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,960
Great for free services, but any paid service is hopeless.

864
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Pretty outrageous, really.

865
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
Yeah, I agree, man.

866
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
That sucks.

867
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Oh, well, it's all part of what Fubar has become, I guess.

868
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Just looking at some Ron Paul stats.

869
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
This is great.

870
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
I'd love this one who sent me this.

871
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,960
This is sent to me by Mike Feldabor.

872
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,960
I sent me a Google page count.

873
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
People looking X for president.

874
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,960
So X would be one of the names.

875
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,960
And at the top, I see a number three is Hillary Clinton with about 300,000 results.

876
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,960
John Edwards with a little more than Hillary Clinton.

877
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
And then Ron Paul with almost a million.

878
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
It's a great graph.

879
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
I don't know exactly what it means.

880
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
But I'm really hoping.

881
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:36,960
I'm really hoping that what it means is that the mainstream media is just not catching on to what the public is really saying or what they're thinking.

882
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
Either that or we have a very small group of people doing this.

883
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,960
All group of people doing a hell of a lot of work.

884
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,960
One of the other will find out soon in the primaries.

885
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Hey, Adam, there's a woman.

886
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,960
I'm in San Francisco and you're not once again.

887
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Fly out here and we always seem to miss each other.

888
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
But I get stopped by the officers.

889
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,960
I got to go to both officers and I saw Kevin, Moody, Natalie, Lisa.

890
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,960
I hit a bunch of people there and I say everybody is heads down, working hard.

891
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Hey, Robin, don't be hitting my people over there.

892
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,960
So I just wanted to thank everybody publicly for working so hard to make much so better.

893
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,960
I also want to give a special thanks to Richard who is always a class act.

894
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
So once again, this is Robin.

895
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
Beautiful day.

896
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Looking at my window here and just from the flying perspective.

897
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
I have okay.

898
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
You know, yeah.

899
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
At least 200 miles there's a building.

900
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,960
I'm looking forward to taking off out of here.

901
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Very soon.

902
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,960
All right.

903
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Tailwinds, my friend.

904
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
And we'll talk again soon.

905
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
Yeah.

906
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
Back at your Robin.

907
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
Tailwinds to you.

908
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,960
And there's nothing, an airman likes hearing more than cavo.

909
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
Okay.

910
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
And it was cavo.

911
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Okay.

912
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
This morning here.

913
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,960
I know I'm leaving Sunday, but I'm really contemplating.

914
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
I don't give a shit.

915
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
What kind of weather it is tomorrow?

916
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
I've got it cranked the engine on the Delta share.

917
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
She hasn't flown for like what a month now.

918
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
She's got to fly.

919
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,960
You know, I don't think it's good to just leave your aircraft sitting around unflown.

920
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Even though it's inside, it's nice in the hangar.

921
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,960
You know, it's all dry and warm and cozy.

922
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
That's not a good idea.

923
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,960
And I'm going to be gone for another week.

924
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
Crap.

925
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Crap.

926
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,960
Crap.

927
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,960
Here's what I missed.

928
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,960
I don't know if I'd missed it in email or, you know, I'd put it in a folder somewhere

929
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,960
but it was a good piece of feedback from our buddy.

930
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
Oh, shit.

931
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,960
You know what?

932
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,960
It's time for his jingle.

933
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
Hey, buddy.

934
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
We love you.

935
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,960
Coming up with something really important to say.

936
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
He is our satellite repairman.

937
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,960
The satellite repairman's coming after you.

938
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,960
The satellite repairman works he can't do.

939
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,960
He'll fix your misconceptions and answer questions too.

940
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,960
There's nothing in the universe and he can't do for you.

941
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,960
The satellite repairman.

942
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
Woo!

943
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
The satellite repairman.

944
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
Here.

945
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,960
Come on in, Peter.

946
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Go, Adam.

947
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Peedub.

948
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,960
On Tuesday, you had this to say about the writer's strike.

949
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
Because I don't believe they're going to work this out.

950
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,960
In fact, I think it's very difficult to work out this writer's strike because,

951
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,960
well, quite honestly, you know, it's very,

952
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,960
and complicated to make money online with, with video.

953
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,960
No one's really making any, we're making money.

954
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
It's costing a lot still to do it.

955
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,960
But, you know, look at the YouTube.

956
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,960
I don't even see any ads.

957
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,960
Let alone a few.

958
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Just look at, you know, many other sites out there.

959
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
The known is really making a lot of money.

960
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,960
Dude, what are you talking about?

961
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,960
What does making money have to do with it?

962
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,960
If the studios aren't making any money off the internet,

963
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,960
then why wouldn't they be willing to agree to pay a few percent of what they make

964
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,960
to the writers?

965
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,960
Isn't three or four percent of nothing?

966
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Nothing?

967
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,960
What's so hard about agreeing to pay nothing?

968
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,960
The only possible answer is that they would have to pay something.

969
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,960
Because, despite what you say, they are, in fact, making something.

970
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Dude, nobody refuses to pay nothing.

971
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Dude, you're talking about profit.

972
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
There's one thing we know in Hollywood.

973
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,960
There is never any profit.

974
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:28,960
And they don't receive a percentage of the sales price of DVDs or the retail price.

975
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,960
They receive a fixed amount per disc that is pressed.

976
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:37,960
There's an entire infrastructure set up, which, of course, is full of holes and back doors

977
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
and stuff the drops off the truck.

978
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
And there's all kinds of shan against going on.

979
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,960
But in just because it's the same as the record business in general.

980
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,960
There is a pretty good system of counting how many CDs went out and exactly who deserves

981
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
money from each individual CD.

982
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,960
It's not a percentage of the profit of the CD, which, by the way, is the real issue here.

983
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
That's where real money is being made.

984
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,960
And, of course, the studios and whoever else is on the other side of the table from the writers

985
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,960
fuck the writers, because they said that they actually would up there, you know, make them whole

986
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
or whatever term they used.

987
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
But they never did.

988
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,960
So, you know, that is a big problem.

989
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,960
Just add on top of that, that they're lying to the writers by saying,

990
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,960
you know, that online version of the show, the episode we put up there for people to watch,

991
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
that's promotional activity.

992
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,960
So, you know, it's like, of course, there's all kinds of bullshit going on.

993
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,960
But it's just not the same thing.

994
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,960
You know, a one single video viewed by one person.

995
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,960
You can't really define the price of that, the revenue because advertising

996
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,960
is a whole different way of making money on a product or on a service.

997
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,960
So, it's not that they don't deserve anything.

998
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,960
It's not that they shouldn't have any piece of the pie.

999
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,960
You know, I understand where they're coming from.

1000
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,960
But the whole idea of residuals is going to be problematic moving forward.

1001
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,960
It really is because a residual is basically money you're making off of a copy.

1002
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
There you go.

1003
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,960
A copy of a piece of work that is used in, you know, usually a typical

1004
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,960
and syndication or a DVD format.

1005
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,960
But it's, you know, now we have a whole different revenue model.

1006
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,960
I like what Jack Myers is saying at jackmires.com.

1007
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:30,960
He says the advertising agencies who have great benefit from advertising

1008
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
on online video and audio.

1009
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,960
They are the ones that should be putting money aside for the writers

1010
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,960
and giving it up, you know, through some understandable key,

1011
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,960
I guess, some understandable way of slicing and dicing the money.

1012
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
But that's even before it hits the studios.

1013
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
It's, it's really a good way to do it.

1014
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
I don't think it'll ever happen.

1015
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Well, actually, that would be kind of interesting.

1016
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Wouldn't it be interesting if the writers just went to work for the advertising companies

1017
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
directly and cut out the entire studio?

1018
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,960
Hmm.

1019
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Hmm.

1020
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
That's something there, I think.

1021
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,960
Hey, hey, Adam, this is Miss Angelica Jinks and...

1022
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
What?

1023
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,960
Otherwise known as Naive London Girl.

1024
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,960
It's feeling like a red pill sort of morning here.

1025
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,960
Now, I know Adam, you listen to our podcast,

1026
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,960
but I would love, love, love it.

1027
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,960
If something you're regular listeners, check us out as well.

1028
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
Yeah, I do listen to your show.

1029
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
And it's dirty.

1030
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
That's all I can say.

1031
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
You guys have a dirty ass show.

1032
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,960
Naive London Girl dot pod show dot com.

1033
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,960
This month, Wanda and I are chatting about sex while you're on vacation.

1034
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,960
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1035
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,960
It's hot holiday sex.

1036
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,960
Exposing your affair to your lover's wife.

1037
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,960
Cocaine and my hot lesbian sex.

1038
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,960
I'm telling you, this is a great show.

1039
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Sex during menstruation and my very favorite topic.

1040
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,960
Kind of linguists.

1041
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,960
Hmm.

1042
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
Now, it's amateur talk, so adults only.

1043
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,960
Yeah.

1044
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,960
That's Naive London Girl dot pod show dot com.

1045
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,960
It's Tim Curry.

1046
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,960
No, no, it's Adam Curry.

1047
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
It's so freaking tall.

1048
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
He's really tall.

1049
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
He's so tall.

1050
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,960
He's like a foot and a half tall.

1051
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,960
He's got longevity and a long willy.

1052
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,960
All right, then.

1053
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,960
Naive London Girl.

1054
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,960
If you really want to hear what women are saying behind closed doors,

1055
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
you don't even need to open the door.

1056
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
They talk so loud.

1057
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,960
You're like Naive London Girl dot pod show dot com.

1058
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,960
Hi, Adam.

1059
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,960
It's Matt from Games Weasel.

1060
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,960
On this week's show, we've got a review of Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.

1061
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,960
Also, we're going to the Olympic Games with Mario and Sonic.

1062
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,960
I've downloaded some great games on the Wii and the Xbox 360.

1063
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,960
We'll let you know how they play.

1064
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,960
And you can win copies of A's Combat 6 for the 360.

1065
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,960
That's all at gamesweasel.beteepotshow.com.

1066
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,960
Yo, thank you very much, Matt.

1067
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,960
I gotta give me a Wii, man.

1068
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,960
Sounds like too many people are having fun without me on this device.

1069
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,960
They would fit perfectly here in the manner.

1070
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,960
You know, this is the kind of song that works so well when it's kind of cold

1071
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,960
and dark outside.

1072
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
If you want that kind of warm Jamaica feeling,

1073
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,960
10CC doesn't for you.

1074
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,960
I was walking down the street.

1075
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,960
Concentrating on truck and ride.

1076
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,960
I heard a dog push beside of me.

1077
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,960
And I looked around in the state of fright.

1078
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,960
I saw four places.

1079
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,960
One man, a brother from the gutter.

1080
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,960
They look me up and down the deck.

1081
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,960
They turn to each other.

1082
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,960
I say, I don't like wicked stuff.

1083
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
I don't know.

1084
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,960
I love it, don't.

1085
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,960
I don't like wicked stuff.

1086
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,960
I don't know.

1087
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,960
I love it, don't.

1088
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,960
I don't know how to love it.

1089
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,960
You got to show some respect.

1090
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,960
I don't know how to love it.

1091
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,960
I watch the whole evening.

1092
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,960
Well, you look down at my silver chain.

1093
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,960
You said, I'll give you one dollar.

1094
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,960
I said, you got to give your demand.

1095
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,960
It was a present from my mother.

1096
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,960
She said, I like it.

1097
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,960
I want it.

1098
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
I'll take it off your hand.

1099
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
And you'll be sorry.

1100
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,960
You cross with.

1101
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,960
You better understand it.

1102
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,960
I say, I don't like wicked stuff.

1103
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,960
I don't know.

1104
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
I love it, don't.

1105
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,960
I don't like wicked stuff.

1106
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,960
I love it, don't.

1107
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,960
I love it, don't.

1108
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,960
I don't like this guy.

1109
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,960
I don't know how to love it.

1110
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,960
I don't like wicked stuff.

1111
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,960
I heard it, but I don't know how to love it.

1112
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,960
I've been a girl, I don't know how to love it.

1113
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,960
I heard it, but I don't like this guy.

1114
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,960
I don't like something, how to love it.

1115
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,960
She said, I got it.

1116
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,960
I want it.

1117
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,960
I want it.

1118
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,960
I want it.

1119
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
I want it.

1120
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,960
I want it.

1121
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,960
I want it.

1122
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,960
I want it.

1123
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,960
I want it.

1124
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,960
I don't like to make up.

1125
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,960
I don't.

1126
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,960
I love it.

1127
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,960
I love it.

1128
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,960
I don't like to make up.

1129
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,960
10cc's dreadlock holiday wrapping up another week as we get closer to the end of 2007

Alright

1132

Yeah, that's actually what's mean a good mood

1133
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,960
