1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
then the next generation radio content in my ears.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Fantastic! It's Adam Curry.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
From a super secret area of Gitmo, where he gets to wear one of those fashionable orange jump suits,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and then daily visits with Sergeant Ian.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's Adam Curry in the DSC in 69.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is what nothing to do got my tail,

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but the call I'm going to New York.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We do a planter and watch a tour.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You know my amin' show was fun, but ain't nothing.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They're so pretty, like New York City.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to Brussels and London too.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What they're fast reminds me of you.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm going to Brussels and London too.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What they're fast reminds me of you.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm nipples, this steel your heart, and that's a start.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, I won't be a Boston, not LA.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Sweet home Chicago is too far away.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I got my boots on, walk out the door, and I'm known.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, I've been to Richmond and Phoenix too.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I've been so many places with nothing to do.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You got my tail, I'm the call, I'm going to New York.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I've been to Atlanta and Washington.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You know my amin' show was fun, but ain't nothing.

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
They're so pretty, like New York City.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's right, but I'm here in New York City.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Ain't no city quite as pretty.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I can New York City.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It is that historic code episode number 699er coming to you from Madison Avenue,

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
in New York City.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That is the Michael E. Thomas Band from the Pods Eye Music Network.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hey everybody, I'm here in my hotel room, hand held Mikey in today.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Since my stand broke, and the table here is a little too low to pile up a whole bunch of pillows,

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and I just want to get the show out, get it done.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So if you hear a little bit of the Whitney Houston tapping of the fingers on the microphone, that's me.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, that was the kind of vibe that I was in.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You know, whenever Patricia and I see New York City on television, we always really,

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
we always look at each other and say, man, that really is our home, isn't it?

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And it always does.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It feels like home for some reason, even though we only actually lived in the city for two years.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We lived in Jersey for, it was at 10 years.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I commuted into Manhattan every single day.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So it is.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's home to me.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's always felt that way.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
More than any other city or any other country that we've lived in, both of us have that feeling.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And some of our happiest times were here.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I have to say, those happy times are clouded.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I arrived the evening around 6 p.m. at Newark New Jersey's Liberty Airport,

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
which is the new name for Newark.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's named Liberty.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I think that happened after 2001.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And I feel anything but free to be quite honest.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Of course, you know what happened, stood in the line there, to talk to the customs agent,

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
part of the customs border protection agency, a division of the homeland security.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And the first thing the guy said is, hey, you ever have any trouble getting into the country?

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I said, yeah, in fact, the last three times of arrived here, the United States, my birthplace.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah, he said, well, why should today be any different come with me?

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And he took me along to something which I actually haven't noticed in the three other times I've been checked once in Chicago and twice in San Francisco.

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
They took me to the secondary room.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now, the secondary room is, man, nothing like that welcoming feeling you get from the main entrance there at Liberty Airfield.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No, no.

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's kind of like, no, any government agency back room you'd see in Manhattan,

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
even though this wasn't even Manhattan.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
High desks with the whole wall of the customs border protection agents.

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And yeah, so my passport was given to one of the agents I was told to sit and wait.

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And then till my name was called, and there was a variety of other other people there.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And then by no means was it to all terrorists looking people.

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
In fact, a couple from the UK sitting next to me looking very, very annoyed.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They clearly have been through this a couple of times before.

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And so my name was called and all there come out all the questions again.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, what are you doing here?

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Show me a business card. Oh, you have a phone.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What's that phone number?

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You know, I'm happy to give everything they want.

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You know, why do you live in the UK?

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Kind of question is that.

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But I kept my, kept my cool, you know, no problem.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, went through it.

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I did ask the officer said, you know, this is the fourth time.

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This has happened to me at four times in a row.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, it's, you're on the lookout list.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You see this is some new information I learned here.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's not, it's not the no fly list.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Obviously, because I have no problem getting on to airplanes.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I try to arrive in the United States, you know, the place that I'm from.

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm on the lookout list.

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay, could you tell me why I'm on the lookout list?

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No, I'm sorry. I'm not a liberty to tell you that.

92
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay, dokey.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is there any way I can find out because clearly I don't belong on the list?

94
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, that's not for me to determine, sir.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But here's a piece of paper.

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And there's this, this is so embarrassing.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's an embarrassing country when it comes to this.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Literally zero-oxed, like a fifth generation zero-ox, very, you know,

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
you can just see this has been copied a couple times.

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This is an answer ID number 11.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The date this form was created was January 23, 2003, last updated December 12, 2005.

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The question being, I'm always being stopped for questioning an inspection

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
when clearing immigration and customs. What can I do about that?

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Answer.

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If you've repeatedly experienced intensive inspections going through

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
customs and immigration upon entering the United States after foreign travel,

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
your name or another person's name that is the same or similar to yours,

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
may be entered into the CBP database.

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And parentheses, the Treasury Enforcement Computer System or TECS system.

110
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
If you think this may be the case and you'd like to have the situation reviewed,

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
you can write to US Customs Board of Protection, Freedom of Information Act,

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
blah, blah, blah.

113
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Basically this is a form that, and they even attach an FOIA form.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Under the Freedom of Information Act guidelines, you may ask to receive a copy of any

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
information CBP has on file about you.

116
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You may also ask to be told of any actions taken by CBP regarding your request,

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
which is to be taken off.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I presume if you have already gone through this process and continue to experience

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
difficulties in which to complain about that, please contact our

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Crater Relations Office and then they list a phone number.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So essentially, I did a little bit of research on this TECS.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What is it, Treasury Enforcement Computer System?

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Lots of interesting articles.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If you Google that, you'll come up with some fun stuff.

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This is a basically part of the automatic targeting system.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
All kinds of government agencies tap into this database and provide information and

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
there's a scoring system, apparently.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And if you have little checks, if you have too many check marks,

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
next to different divisions, and this could be anything from

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
motor vehicle to the IRS.

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If you have enough check marks against you, and I'm not quite sure how that

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
calculations done, then your name pops up.

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And then you could call it in for secondary screening.

134
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay.

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So I take my piece of paper, and I still have to get out of the airport.

136
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And so that means that you have to hand that little custom's form to the

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
custom's officer.

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, yes, of course, it's time for a second screening, which is basically the

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
exact same procedure done while they're rummaging through your

140
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
luggage.

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And I mean, I'm not just talking about rummaging, man.

142
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They're open up mail.

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They're looking at correspondence at business cards.

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You know, clearly not looking for any contraband, just trying to determine if

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm a threat to national security.

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And I, you know, it actually took the wind out of me a little bit this

147
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
time around.

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Because I wasn't thinking about it quick turnaround.

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You know, I was home for literally two days.

150
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Got home Saturday morning, hung out with the wife and with

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
with Christina.

152
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And then Sunday, we just hung out some more, went into town.

153
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That is, you know, soaked in some festive holiday spirit, despite a little bit

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
of rain.

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And then, you know, Monday, we had the UK Christmas party for the UK

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
office.

157
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And you know, I was like, oh, I'll just hop over to New York for a couple

158
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
days.

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And I didn't even think about the two and a half hour or

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
deal I would go through.

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And it's, it has absolutely taken the wind out of me a bit.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm really, I'm really demure about it.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm disappointed.

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Really disappointed in what's going on.

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And as a Washington Post dot com article about this very system.

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is from November 30, 2006.

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The federal government disclosed details yesterday of border security program

168
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
to screen all people who enter and leave the United States who

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
create a, to create a terrorism risk profile of each individual

170
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and retain that information for up to 40 years.

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So this could be gone for a while for me.

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I mean, it doesn't, it's not like the, they're doing everything

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
essentially, but a body probe.

174
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, and wouldn't surprise me if they did one of those on me one of

175
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
these days either.

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We've been doing risk assessment of cargo and passengers coming in

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
out of the US, the Department of Home, Homeland Security

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
spokesman Jared, agent said, we have the authority in the

179
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
ability to do it for passengers coming by land and sea.

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So let's see.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's see if there's anything else in here.

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's just a lot of new, this, here we go.

183
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The parent program, the automatic, the, here we go.

184
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The automated targeting system relies on government databases that

185
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
include law enforcement data, shipping manifests,

186
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
travel itineraries, airline passenger data such as names

187
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
addresses credit card details, phone numbers, the parent program

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
treasury enforcement communication system houses every,

189
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
quote, every possible type of information from a variety of

190
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
federal, state and local sources.

191
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's debilitating and disappointing is what this is.

192
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay, but here's, here's the one interesting thing.

193
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You know, this whole under the Freedom of Information Act,

194
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
you can request what's on your file.

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't think so.

196
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
According to yesterday's notice, this is from my year ago.

197
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The program is exempt from certain requirements of the privacy

198
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
act of 1974 that allow for instance people to access records

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to determine if the system contains a record pertaining to a

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
particular individual and for the purpose of

201
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
contesting the content of their record.

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So essentially, you can't get that information.

203
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I, you know, I guess I'm going to file a Freedom of Information Act

204
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
to see what's on my record and what's, what's up with that.

205
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But I think that I am one of the apparently millions, millions

206
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
of United States citizens who are going through this.

207
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And it makes me, it makes me sad, it makes me angry,

208
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
obviously, because dude, it's my country.

209
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I was born here.

210
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I defend, I do defend this country.

211
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Tooth and nail, with my life, if I had to, you guys know that.

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But the feeling is waning a little bit because this is

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
seriously fucked up.

214
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And just you fuckers waiting till we get Ron Paul

215
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
into the White House.

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And we're going to change some shit then, boy, I tell you.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Hey, Adam, this is Dean down here and Houston, Texas.

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I think one thing that's been missing in this whole

219
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Ron Paul debate is nobody's called in who's actually

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
represented by Ron Paul in Congress.

221
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Well, that would be you.

222
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah.

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And I have to say, I've lived here for 15 years and I've

224
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
voted against him every time he's come up for election

225
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
because while I applaud his stand on the war and think

226
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
we ought to be doing something about that, I think

227
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
an America that was governed the way Ron Paul's philosophy

228
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
describes America would not be in America.

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We'd want to live in.

230
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm all for the Constitution and supporting the Constitution,

231
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
but the Constitution doesn't say anything about food

232
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
safety, product safety, the environment, a well-maintained

233
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
infrastructure, space exploration, science,

234
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
the internet, anything like that.

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And what Ron Paul says is if it's not in the Constitution,

236
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I want private enterprise to do it.

237
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Well, I think we see what happens when private enterprise

238
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
regulates and maintained itself.

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The savings and the whole thing.

240
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Hold on a second.

241
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Hold on a second.

242
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This is going to get into some stuff that we have to go

243
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
point by point.

244
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And I understand what you're saying.

245
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
My friend from Texas.

246
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But it's a little over-simplifying things just a little bit.

247
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You can't just say big business is horrible

248
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and regulating itself.

249
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's just not a fair statement.

250
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
By the way, who says we have to deal with big business?

251
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll deal with little business if I want to trust the food

252
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
that I'm putting into my body.

253
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I certainly don't trust the FDA.

254
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But you're right.

255
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You know what?

256
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I think we should let the country just go exactly the way it is.

257
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Horace Good Citizens.

258
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We're just trying to make a buck.

259
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I employ a hundred fucking people.

260
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
A hundred people.

261
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Some schmuck.

262
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You know what?

263
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I just got to say it again.

264
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Skull fuck the rotting corpse of the TSA

265
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
and the Department of Homeland Security.

266
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay?

267
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Screw you guys.

268
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Catch some real criminals.

269
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's a real terrorist.

270
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So anyway,

271
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
that's okay that you have a different opinion.

272
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I think your misguided though

273
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
because Ron Paul is not exactly saying what you are hearing,

274
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
which is unfortunate.

275
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We have to go through a transition period.

276
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We have to change the ways of our country and the way we run it.

277
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And it will take a transition period of a decade probably.

278
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I think Ron Paul is only offering to be a transitionary president.

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I think that's just fine.

280
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So yeah, of course, you can't just switch everything off.

281
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You can't just turn everything around in a heartbeat,

282
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
but you can certainly start.

283
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Food safety.

284
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Toys from China.

285
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You know, I think there's a place for government.

286
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't think we need government regulating every instance of our life.

287
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But.

288
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But it's like on that way.

289
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Try the industry.

290
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Keeping track of what goes into my food and saying,

291
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't worry about those chemicals.

292
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It'll be fine.

293
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Trust us.

294
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We're just here to make a profit.

295
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I think there's portions of the.

296
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I think the problems are much bigger than that much, much bigger.

297
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They go way beyond that.

298
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're working for the man.

299
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You're being ruled by the man.

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Hi, Adam.

301
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This is Janice from New York.

302
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm calling about that Eisenhower quote that you.

303
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Played on.

304
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I think it was DSC 65 and you keep talking about.

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You don't seem to have no one seems to have called in yet to tell you that that's part of a movie.

306
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I think it was made.

307
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I think it's a relatively recent movie.

308
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Maybe maybe within the last one or two years.

309
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The movie is called Why We Fight.

310
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And it's all about the military industrial complex.

311
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And it has a video of that.

312
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Clip of Eisenhower is close.

313
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
A few other choice.

314
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Video clips of him.

315
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So I think you can enjoy renting that movie.

316
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I think it.

317
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Come out in the last couple of years.

318
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Anyway, one of the thank you for the Bailey.

319
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So let's go then.

320
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I love you, Adam.

321
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Thank you, Janice.

322
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So close by too.

323
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Just drop off some naked pictures.

324
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah.

325
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I saw that movie.

326
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Why we fight.

327
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And that's probably when I got the white picked up on the quote from Eisenhower to be quite

328
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
honest.

329
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And then I found it later on on YouTube or I thought about it later.

330
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I can't remember exactly which.

331
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That is indeed a great movie.

332
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And there's another one that I was just given a link to.

333
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It seems to be a really, really long one.

334
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's up on YouTube and 31 different parts.

335
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's called Bloodlines of Power.

336
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm sure it'll have to do with the illuminati.

337
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And I can get into that kind of stuff, too.

338
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You know, pieces of bits and bobs of it.

339
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But I got to tell you, I'm just a sucker for watching that kind of stuff.

340
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I do like it.

341
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And it's funny.

342
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I was at the Heathrow Airport.

343
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And I wanted to pick up, actually.

344
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I want, you know, I've been looking for a book on Eisenhower.

345
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And I've gotten a couple of different suggestions.

346
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I thought, you know, I'll just hop in the bookstore that had a borders bookstore at Heathrow Airport upon departure.

347
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And I looked in the biography section.

348
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And it's all like celebrities or celebrities, you know, from Big Brother.

349
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And it's unbelievable.

350
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's TV hosts, all kind, you know, Paris, Hilton, Victoria Beckham.

351
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No fucking Eisenhower.

352
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Not a single series biography at all whatsoever about a real historical figure.

353
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The biography category has just become, you know,

354
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
celebrities and their, and their books is pretty crazy.

355
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Anyway, so, you know, I was on my way to the Virgin Clubhouse after trying to score the Eisenhower book.

356
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And behind me, I hear someone go, hey, cut the cup.

357
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Which is, there's only one guy in the world who says that Steve leads from MTV who hired me in 1986 to come to work for MTV.

358
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He, he was walking behind me.

359
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And I knew he was going to be in the UK for the Led Zeppelin concert because he promoted

360
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Led Zeppelin back way back in the day in the Ahmed Erdogan days.

361
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And of course, this was also, I told you this was also Monday.

362
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And I had the special VIP ticket, but I didn't go.

363
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I went, of course, to the Pancho UK London office Christmas party, which was probably more fun.

364
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Although, you know, the importance of a historic event like Led Zeppelin, you know,

365
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
you know, just heard a little bit, not being there.

366
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So that was kind of cool to hook up with the leads, my surf course.

367
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
He works at a serious satellite radio now, soon to be serious and XM.

368
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
He was actually in his own little mini crisis, you know, to get into the,

369
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
into the serious building, you have to go through security.

370
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Like almost every single building in New York these days were crazy.

371
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You know, you got these idiots with an X-ray machine.

372
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And you got it, this is, they're really going to catch all my shit, not, you know,

373
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
that just rent a security door.

374
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And so he's talking to a Keith Richards manager.

375
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Keith Richards scheduled for, I guess, for an interview or something this week,

376
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
up at serious and the manager was like, say, well, you know,

377
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
what's the security like in the building?

378
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And yes, he was explaining, well, you know, it's just your typical New York building security.

379
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah, but, you know, Keith always carries a knife with him.

380
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So, you know, and he, and he won't, he won't go anywhere without his knife.

381
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And I know this because it's a bowie knife.

382
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I've seen it before.

383
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And so I was like, oh, man, what happened to the good old days or rock and roll?

384
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
They are forever gone, my friends.

385
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No, security is taken away even the right for our friend Keith Richards to bring along his bowie knife.

386
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip.

387
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
All right.

388
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
From the US, we go check out the European Union, our special correspondent,

389
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
commentary blogger standing by what's going on, my friend.

390
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Hello, Adam Kerry.

391
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Here is CSV.

392
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Your eucrass pondered reporting life from the EU.

393
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So, the French president, Sakaze,

394
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
wants to create Mediterranean Union between South Europe and North Africa.

395
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And it is pissing off other EU leaders because he wants to use EU money.

396
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
EU money on that new union, which we will have capital in Paris.

397
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And you can go down the toilet because of this and die.

398
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:19,000
In meantime, each French cow gets more money from EU subsidies than could fit at three African villages.

399
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
PS.

400
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Galileo will offer high precision to everybody unlike GPS.

401
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That is offering it only to military, but not to civilians this high precision.

402
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And I don't want to fuck you Adam Kerry, but I like you.

403
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yo.

404
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah, I've been reading about that.

405
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So, cause he's doing some interesting stuff.

406
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
He had a doffy over the other day.

407
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Good doffy ordered some planes.

408
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Some airbus planes, I believe, for the Libyan Airlines.

409
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah, the Galileo, I did read up on that as well.

410
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I believe that you can get the ultra super accurate Galileo signal,

411
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
but you do have to pay extra money for it.

412
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So, I think they'll still have a kind of an inaccurate signal just for your regular home applications

413
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and for your car navigation, but you do have to pay.

414
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
At least you're able to pay more for it.

415
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So, I have to say that's kind of cool.

416
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
In the ever existing pursuit of a better mobile setup,

417
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
got an interesting comment.

418
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Interesting suggestion.

419
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't know if it's going to work though.

420
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You know, I've got the Mac and people keep saying,

421
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll try out Uber Caster and I like Uber Caster,

422
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
but it doesn't work because on the MacBook Pro,

423
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
you don't have a, you've got latency, basically.

424
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
No matter what device you use,

425
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
unless you use an external mixer,

426
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
the one I'm using right now, I lug that along.

427
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And I'm actually using Cas Blaster,

428
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
so I lug along a secondary, I lug along the via,

429
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
which basically functions as a studio machine now.

430
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But I'd love to just carry one machine.

431
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And here's a suggestion that I hadn't heard before.

432
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Hi Adam, this is Hans.

433
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I was born and raised in the south of the Netherlands.

434
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Sorry to hear that.

435
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
In the south of the US,

436
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
just listening to the DSC 698,

437
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and you mentioned that you were looking at getting

438
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
some different preamps in compression for your on the road.

439
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Like for so nice.

440
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
If you have a MacBook,

441
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I thought you might want to check out the Apple GDWAT,

442
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
which is a Firewire interface.

443
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Really, really nice conversion.

444
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's got great, very clean preamps built into it,

445
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and it runs up a bus power, so you don't need it.

446
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Another break to plug into the wall.

447
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Also, since you have a MacBook,

448
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
you could also put a expansion slot on the side.

449
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You can actually put in one of those universal audio cards.

450
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
They make one that's actually four laptop.

451
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's called the UAD Expander.

452
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And their plug-ins are phenomenal.

453
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I don't know if you're a software that you're using uses plugins,

454
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
but if you can use no standard,

455
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
VST, or we'll see other type of the audio unit plugins,

456
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
you can't really go wrong with those guys.

457
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You know, you can be on the road

458
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and run a fair child, or 1176 from LA 2A,

459
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and really, really nice gear.

460
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So anyway, check it out.

461
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Enjoy your show.

462
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Go run Paul.

463
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Talk to you soon.

464
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yo, yo, thanks, man.

465
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So I need some help here.

466
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I need to know, and I like hardware solutions,

467
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
but I don't like them when they're USB or Firewire related.

468
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Because I've only seen, I've only heard latency,

469
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and I just can't be talking through a microphone.

470
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And I want to hear the process signal.

471
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't want to hear the naked mic.

472
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I've got to hear what you guys are hearing.

473
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
What people are going to be hearing in their earbud.

474
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So it's got to be after the compression,

475
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
after any processing takes place.

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
If there's going to be latency,

477
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm just not going to buy one of these.

478
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
So I really appreciate it.

479
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
If you could let me know if there's going to be any latency

480
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
with these devices.

481
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Because otherwise, it just absolutely don't cut it for me.

482
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Otherwise, yeah, I like it.

483
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It takes all the boxes there with the running off of bus power,

484
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and not having a lug along another machine.

485
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Boy, I could safely say I would really, really love that.

486
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yeah, I'm curious.

487
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's just so calton calm.

488
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You just wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas

489
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and a happy New Year and all that little stuff.

490
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's just awesome to let you know.

491
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
There is a third version of the Hanukkah song.

492
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I actually sent it to you through a website called YouSend it.

493
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Thank you to theamacotchot.com.

494
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So too is, you know what?

495
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I love you Adam Curry.

496
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah.

497
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I already have a good one both.

498
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah.

499
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah.

500
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
At least not be done.

501
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Thank you.

502
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Thank you.

503
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Merry Christmas.

504
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And a happy Hanukkah.

505
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I didn't know there was a part three already,

506
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
but indeed, I got it through that website.

507
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You call YouSendit.com.

508
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Well, here it is.

509
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the deraille dowels.

510
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Thank you.

511
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Thank you.

512
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's time for my love.

513
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Once again, it's time for my love.

514
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Merry Christmas.

515
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Thank you.

516
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Thank you.

517
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Thank you, guys.

518
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So incredible to be back here.

519
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Thank you.

520
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Okay.

521
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Hanukkah is the festival of lights.

522
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
One day of presents.

523
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
How no, we get to eat.

524
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Really nice.

525
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But if you still feel like the only kid in town,

526
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
without a Christmas tree,

527
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I guess my first two songs didn't do it for you.

528
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So here comes number three.

529
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Awesome Phoebe from France.

530
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Say the Hanukkah blessing.

531
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Solders, ladies, pal, squeaky, and wheeled graces.

532
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Deborah Messing.

533
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Melissa Gilbert and Michael and it never mixed feet with dairy.

534
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Maybe they should have called that show.

535
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Little kosher house on the prairie.

536
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
We got cheer in Louis.

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Back still a ranch, jackback.

538
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Tom Arnold converted the Judaism.

539
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But you guys can have him back.

540
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Just get done it.

541
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We've been a getter kiss on the need of this old toe.

542
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But we can't do it on either.

543
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
We do something I know.

544
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm Jewish.

545
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Dayday.

546
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Never.

547
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Here comes my God.

548
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Look to Evelyn Nelson's band.

549
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You play as harmonica.

550
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Celebrates harmonica.

551
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Tiny Elvis, ladies and gentlemen.

552
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Tyrande!

553
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Schneider, I did not even know you were Jewish.

554
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm a Filipino Jew.

555
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
In fact, I got around home and like the first pig.

556
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You're going.

557
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh, some have been running.

558
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Not a big fan of the Jews.

559
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Well, maybe that's because he lost a figure skating match.

560
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
The gold medalist Sarah Hughes, how about my students?

561
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Who did he a David Blaine escaped straight jacket with such precision?

562
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But the one thing they could not get out of, their painful circumcision.

563
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
We're in a pouches half Jewish, but a full-time Oscar winner.

564
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Jennifer Conley's half Jewish dude, and I'd like to put some more in her.

565
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
There's Louie, favorite pair of men, and more have gold.

566
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
She always alone invented quadcopp music, but first game, he rules school.

567
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Hey, Natalie, more conical.

568
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It's not a single way around a group.

569
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I always find getting a half truncum, all this joyful, joyful Oscar.

570
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So get a high colaca, and so you're your long jalanca.

571
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
If I've been here really well in a car, have I heard it?

572
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I've heard it, I've heard it, I've heard it.

573
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Happy Holidays!

574
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The incomparable Adam Sandler.

575
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And the Anacosar in part three.

576
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I guess that was from Saturday Night Live.

577
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
What I get here there.

578
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Excellent.

579
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
What do we know?

580
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Is this the seventh or eighth night?

581
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah.

582
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Man.

583
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
More Anacosar in the pod save music that we network crowd people.

584
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
We got plenty of Christmas tunes coming in.

585
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
More Anacosar.

586
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Why aren't there more Anacosar in Jane?

587
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
There's Sandy from Germany again.

588
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah.

589
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I just got back from my evening walk listening to the Charlie.

590
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And I got a little idea.

591
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I saw so many people tonight too.

592
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Wearing their earbuds and listening to something.

593
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And I don't know what they are listening to.

594
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So I wondered, how could I make, how could I make it visible to me and all the others?

595
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
What, what these people are listening to?

596
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And here's my simple little idea.

597
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Why don't all of the Charlie listeners make a little not in the cable of the ear,

598
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
but the right or left you can decide.

599
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You can decide if your folder is going to hurt or fuck you.

600
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I love you Adam Curry.

601
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So why don't we do this for a week or two?

602
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Just make a little not in your cable.

603
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So we can see each other in the tube on a street and the park.

604
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Wherever we're listening to the Charlie.

605
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And maybe someone can say hi to each other.

606
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And just have a casual nice meeting, a coffee or something.

607
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Change some naked pictures.

608
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Talk about what we think about the stuff that was set by you Adam Curry.

609
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Oh, that's all.

610
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And I love you for saying it every day.

611
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Thank you.

612
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And I sure appreciate it. Have a nice day.

613
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You know, in general not a bad idea.

614
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't think the the reach of this show goes far enough for the,

615
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
and you do you to be bumping into Charlie heads all over the place.

616
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah, it does happen, but I don't know if it's if the,

617
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
the not in the in the earbud cable is going to work.

618
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
There is of course the solution, you know,

619
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
only have to do or start wearing the wrong brand.

620
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Once those t-shirts come out, you'll be easy to identify Charlie heads.

621
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Hey Adam, this is Craig calling.

622
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I just wanted to say, you know, you are so wrong.

623
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I can't believe you thought of such a wrong idea.

624
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's just the wrong thing to do at the wrong time with the wrong people,

625
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and it's the wrong clothes.

626
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It is so wrong.

627
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Brilliant.

628
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Love you Adam.

629
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Hi Adam, it's Matt from Games Weasel.

630
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
On this week's show, we've got a review of Assassin's Creed on the 360.

631
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Also, we get out of jail with Kane and Lynch dead men on the 360.

632
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
We've got copies of Assassin's Creed to give away on the PlayStation 3,

633
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and David Doug from free radical design.

634
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
The people behind time splitters and back in the day golden.

635
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I tell us about their brand new first person shooter on the PS3.

636
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
That's all at gamesweasel.btpodshow.com.

637
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah, make sure you check out Games Weasel TV.

638
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I think the new site is up Games WeaselTV.btpodshow.com.

639
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It too is a completely awesome, with all the latest clips from all the latest games.

640
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Matt Cuddle bringing you was expertise and insight, as always.

641
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
For those of you wondering, you know, what all this stuff is about the wrong brand

642
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and where the wrong clothes, the wrong time with the wrong people.

643
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm gearing up to figure out how we can all protest, how we can protest against the government.

644
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
In a peaceful protest to bring back control to the masses.

645
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
There has to be a way I think I've come up with an interesting solution.

646
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
The way to get the government's attention is to stop purchasing, to stop consuming.

647
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We truly are the force in the American economy, not Wall Street, not the oil companies, but the consumers.

648
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We're going to buy hundreds of billions of dollars worth of stuff this Christmas season.

649
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's already started and we don't stop and we're encouraged to continue to shop.

650
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Just listen to your leaders.

651
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So that's the way towards civil disobedience.

652
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And I'm still working on the, I'm still working on the campaign here, as I sit in my luxurious hotel.

653
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm in New York trying to rape Madison Avenue and more money, but we're going to come up with something for sure.

654
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Hi Adam, this is Tracy from San Diego, just listening to, is your baby source code about stopping the consumerism.

655
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And you were wondering, like, oh, any economists out there?

656
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Well, I'm an Austrian economics point of view, which is what Ron Paul supports.

657
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
There is something we could do to really throw a monkey wrench in their whole plan.

658
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And that would be, we stopped consuming from a large corporation, started supporting smaller independent entrepreneurs and businesses.

659
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
There you go.

660
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yep.

661
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And see if we hold our dollars in our bank account, or even in cash, the government can still manipulate them by printing more dollars,

662
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
which will still the wealth of the dollars that we have.

663
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Which is how they're paying for it, rack. That's why it all is down about 50% since district office.

664
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yep.

665
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
But what we can do is we can convert our certain notes to gold, which they can't really screw it.

666
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And there's actually a very cheap way to do that with gold money dot com.

667
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah, you know, and I looked at that gold money dot com.

668
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And I understand what you're saying, what you're saying is two things.

669
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You can really protest by buying local buying from small independence.

670
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And boy, what an idea there, huh?

671
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Instead of going to the big box supermarket and getting your frozen dinner, go get some fresh produce.

672
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Make something at home.

673
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Spend some time with your family.

674
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Don't watch an hour of television.

675
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Cook.

676
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Come on.

677
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
You'll have fun doing it.

678
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Trust me.

679
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So by small by local, I'm down with that.

680
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But then protecting your money by buying gold.

681
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Yeah, that's hard.

682
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
There's lots of outfits on the web where basically they hold the gold and you put money in your account.

683
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And then it goes to their account.

684
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You get certified gold bars or whatever.

685
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't know, man.

686
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
They rated that mint company the other day.

687
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
They also took their gold and silver.

688
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I think I don't think we can protect ourselves against that one way or the other.

689
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
The government can still come into your home, come into your bank account and take whatever they want to.

690
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So that probably there's no way to safeguard that.

691
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:13,000
But I still think it's a good idea to protest by no longer buying big by American, by products that are manufactured or grown in the United States.

692
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And don't get it from big chains.

693
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Let's just stop it.

694
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I think we can all do that, can't we?

695
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
We're really if we ship it a lot of our consumer purchases to goldmoney.com.

696
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And I had our local businesses use that form of currency.

697
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,000
We would really screw with them a lot because one way would be attacking their money count, which is,

698
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
be federal reserve banks.

699
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
The big banks, like Walt Kovie Wells Fargo that are members of the federal reserve,

700
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
would be attacking medium of exchange, which would be the US dollar.

701
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It would be attacking a store of wealth, which would be the US dollar.

702
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
By converting all our cash balances and the gold into the demand for the dollar, which is based further pressure,

703
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
which would not allow them to purchase as many goods and bomb as many people over there and interact.

704
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Anyways, that's one of the biggest way to think.

705
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
We get throw a month-to-earensional plan that you're talking about by reducing our consumer spending.

706
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Just convert federal reserve notes and gold.

707
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
There's an allocated storage either a coin in your hand or something like goldmoney.com.

708
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And then refuse to spend at any of the big companies and just shop with your local entrepreneurs.

709
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And pay them with goldmoney.

710
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Or something to that effect.

711
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And then I would really hit it there monopoly.

712
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Anyways, thanks.

713
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And I love you, Eric.

714
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yeah, I love you too, man.

715
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I think we need baby steps first.

716
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
We probably should come up with one day.

717
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Just one day where we don't shop.

718
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
One day where we don't go to the mall.

719
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And we can make a dent.

720
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Well, we certainly should be able to make a PR impression.

721
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Of course, a real easy solution in my mind is to get Ron Paul into the White House.

722
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I vote for him in the primaries.

723
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Donate money to the Ron Paul campaign, Ron Paul 2008.

724
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Do it on December 16th, the Boston Tea Party, a 16th, the Boston Tea Party.

725
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It's TeaPartio7.com.

726
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I've already given my $2300.

727
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That's a maximum amount that I can give.

728
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
But I will continue to propagate the message.

729
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Oh, I still have to make my video, too.

730
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Was it four days?

731
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So what is it?

732
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

733
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So Monday?

734
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
No, Sunday is the Boston Tea Party.

735
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So I got to do my endorsement video.

736
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
If you have to switch your party affiliation,

737
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
you have to do that pretty quick,

738
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
depending on which stage you're in.

739
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Otherwise, you can't vote for Ron Paul.

740
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It would really be surprising to me if the amount of votes that Ron Paul received

741
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
really were equal to his polling numbers.

742
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Because they're all over the map.

743
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Most of the time, he's not even showing up.

744
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
They're totally decimated into the sidelines.

745
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yet when he's on television, when he does debate,

746
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
the poll numbers shoot up the numbers that are done by viewers

747
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
during the broadcast.

748
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And he's always at the top of the list.

749
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So I'm just hoping that all that money that we've been collecting

750
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
gets put to good use.

751
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
He starts flooding the market with advertising.

752
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You know, it's the only way we can get anyone elected in this country

753
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
is through money flowing into television and radio advertising.

754
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And I think that will be a solution to a lot of our problems.

755
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And look, I'm a disc jockey, okay?

756
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I don't have a political background.

757
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I've been a business owner, a taxpayer.

758
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm an American.

759
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
But by no means am I a politician.

760
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't claim to understand everything or know everything.

761
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
But I do know the difference between a blue pill and a red pill.

762
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And look at the movies that Hollywood has been given us.

763
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
A lot of this stuff is coming true.

764
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's just coming true.

765
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And there's a reason for it.

766
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And yeah, life imitates art, art imitates life.

767
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You choose.

768
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Pretty amazing that these guys showed up on the podcast music now.

769
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
We're in fact I got a check and see if this is legit.

770
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
If not, then I'll have it removed.

771
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
But no one the guys from Durand ran.

772
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
They probably did put it up themselves.

773
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The podcast music network, this is falling down on Chuck 699er.

774
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
699er.

775
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It's just coming true.

776
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
It's just coming true.

777
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's just coming true.

778

It's just coming true.

786
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's just coming true.

787
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's just coming true.

847
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:19,000
You know, got to tell you, new or old, I just like that band.

848
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Durand, Durand's falling down, you can find it on the Potsay music network.

849
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And I will be doing my diligence on that, but it would not surprise me.

850
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But those guys have been around for a while.

851
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I think they're just as frustrated with the machine as everyone else is.

852
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And they're smart.

853
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I love them for being smart.

854
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000

Relevant in today's program.

860
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Beware.

861
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Live free.

862
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Enjoy your freedom.

863

Live your life with passion.

864
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And score for the running course of the TSA.

Everybody, if I'm not thrown in Gitmo, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
