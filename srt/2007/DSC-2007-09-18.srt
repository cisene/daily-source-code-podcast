1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You better be careful out there on next couple of weeks you hear me?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's close the room.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
No.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Two sides.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Some more later.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You better be with us.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I can be with the nearest one family.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
All the places you've got to come to my place.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm done with you!

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Walking Phoenix, Mark Wahlberg,

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
on October 12th.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Get down!

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Two brothers collide.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Maybe you could be killed.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Right?

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Right?

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We own the night rated R.

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
4 out of 5 Dennis recommend the DSC-664 for their patients who chew gum.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And the fifth one is choking on the blue pill.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Scruncher.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We own the night rated R.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Fantastic.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's Adam Curry.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I don't need no foreign car.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Movie star moon guitar.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But you box in a funky bar and one more night with you.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't need no green charm.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Dad is far falls along.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ain't no pink and you be home as long as you are true.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't need no motorheads.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't need no Biggie Rain.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Bought a fade.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
More pink.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Love the band that loves to swing.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let the girls ride.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's go get us out of town.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Doll down and say round.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hold on knees to rock and sound, And what one ride did.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's go get us out of town.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

I just need my big old friend

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
She's little things to do

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't need no foreign call

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Movie star

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
New guitar

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
She's watching the fucking bar

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And one more night with you

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Line up my voice

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ryan Setsor brings his orchestra to the pod save music network

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
One more night with you

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I was previewing that track

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Earlier on the speakers

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And Patricia came up and she said

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That band, that band that's playing right now

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Was it?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, no kidding

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
When we all love a band like that

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Everybody how you doing is

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Daily source code episode number

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
664 coming to you from the curry

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Manor in G-town west side

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Representing beautiful day today

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I can see the controls of the jets flying overhead

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And actually I'm tracking

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well not the not the jets overhead

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm tracking the general aviation traffic today

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I've got a new little gadget

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
From the pilot geek

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Nerdazoid winky

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Blinky shop known as trans air

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I bought a traffic collision

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Avoid and system

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Which is

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Essentially what it does is it tracks aircraft

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In the general vicinity

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You can set it to certain distances and levels

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And the

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I guess the concept is

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
When you're flying around

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It'll tell you where other traffic is located

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And it will produce a

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have not heard it yet

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It will produce a loud audible warning

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If some things within

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Dangerous limits

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So a new gadget for the Delta Sierra

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Which I plan on flying this weekend

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Because it looks like

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Another trip to Germany is

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Order

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh yeah, we're getting very close

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
My friends

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
My Deutsche of Hoinde

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We're a common boys

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's going to be fun

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So I think we may be in Berlin

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Over the weekend

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Possibly Berlin

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Certainly a trip to Frankfurt

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
To meet some people

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Lots of stuff happening

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Very excited about that

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And of course

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Even though I've got a full week here in the UK

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
In the London crash pad

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I have some time today to bring you

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
A data show

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
A data source code show

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Last night

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It was a

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Patricia and I were in the city

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We went to a

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Let me see it was the name of the company

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There was a reception

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Slash party for

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The radio taxis group

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't know if you've ever heard of them

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll all be in the UK

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You probably have

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I guess they're one of these private car companies

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And they've just started a

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Carbon neutral program

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So they have these huge

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's pretty funny

130
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
They've got these huge

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Extender penis limos

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That run on bio diesel and biofuels

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That was very cool

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And they had a party

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Which was put on by a

136
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Super Agent Keith

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And Alan the Killer Kingston

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And so Patricia and I were invited

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It was pretty cool

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There were lots of people there

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There that we knew

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Race Antili from the Alien Autopsy

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Video series

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And you've been working with him

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
On some stuff

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The Elvis Lost Diaries

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
As an example

148
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Which he says

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
There's lots of cool updates

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So we'll be meeting hopefully

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
For lunch later this week

152
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll tell you what's going on with that

153
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The barefoot doctor was there

154
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We're good to see him

155
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Of course we're working on a show

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
With the good doctor

157
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And this is the guy that is completely

158
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Solved my

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
My numbed index finger

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Just by

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Jabbing his fingers into my vertebrae

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A couple of actors

163
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
From saw one from East Enders

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There was a Patricia point out a few people

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
From Coronation Street

166
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't watch Cory

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So I wouldn't know

168
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Some West Ham united players

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And their wives and or girlfriends

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Also known as the Wags

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It was good

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It was fun to be out

173
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And the Queen's hairdresser

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Or maybe he was a queen hairdresser

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I didn't quite catch it

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But either one would have applied

177
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We'd have a good time

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Very hungry though

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Because they had like snacks

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And we were hungry

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Which we'd be eating the city

182
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And decided to come on home

183
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That rattling in the background

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Is the fan by the way

185
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The temperatures actually heated up a little bit

186
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
In the attic

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And I hope the weather stays this way

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
For the next couple days

189
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Aw wouldn't that be nice to fly with this weather

190
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Ah look it forward to it

191
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Other cool stuff to mention

192
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
For the city PD

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
New episode

194
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The second season

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Episode 4 has dropped

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Things are heating up

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm not going to tell

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, I'm not going to tell you what happens

199
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You must check out this episode

200
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Damn the production has gotten so incredibly

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Ow

202
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sorry

203
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Production has gotten so incredibly good on this show

204
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm really really digging it

205
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll put the episode 4 in the daily source code channel

206
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
If you haven't subscribed to that already

207
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Go to Adam.podshow.com

208
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And look for the DSC channel

209
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll also put that in the show

210
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And you're going to put that standard in the show

211
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No it's now

212
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So you can subscribe to it if you haven't yet

213
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hey Adam, this is Chris Thompson

214
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And so I'll see you

215
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm calling to say hi

216
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And also

217
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I want you to discuss possibly

218
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The iTunes

219
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Music store, wireless music store

220
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Or whatever they're calling it

221
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And they're integration with Starbucks

222
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I know you were talking about doing a thing

223
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
With the Kass 18

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And the UK

225
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll skip the name

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But Apple is doing it with Starbucks

227
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I think pod show should be doing it with

228
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Whatever the company is

229
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Not that you're competition or anything

230
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But still

231
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's just like

232
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You know

233
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It shows that it doesn't market there

234
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So what do you think about that

235
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
In your time speed

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So you're talking about caffeine

237
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Euro

238
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And so I'm going to pick up the

239
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Conversations again

240
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Over the next couple of weeks

241
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
About integrating pod save

242
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Music into the caffeine

243
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Euro experience

244
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And indeed

245
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So first of all

246
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I think that's a pretty interesting

247
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Pretty interesting deal Apple put together

248
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There with Starbucks

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Interesting technological connection

250
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Actually

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Not quite sure how they're going to do it

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Across all the stores

253
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But I guess they've got it figured out

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
They have to drop some kind of hardware

255
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And with some kind of smart software

256
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
To figure out what's playing now

257
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And how you can buy that off of

258
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The iTunes Music store

259
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So a couple things

260
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
One

261
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I understood

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And I, you know, Natalie Delcante

263
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
From texture.pot show.com

264
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You know, she is the expert on all this stuff

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And she went to the unveiling of the new iPods

266
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And she said that there was indeed

267
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
A capability to access podcasts

268
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Wirelessly

269
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But I don't know if that only works

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you're at Starbucks

271
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm not too sure this seems to be a lot of

272
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You know, just a lot of questions

273
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Up in the air about about how that's going to work

274
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I had personally

275
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I think there's other ways

276
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It doesn't all have to be about the sales

277
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Just the exposure I think is the exciting part

278
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And quite honestly

279
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't know, man

280
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm a little down now on the whole the iPod thing

281
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Apparently there's a new version of iTunes

282
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Out which now encrypts the way it talks to the iPod

283
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So people who are using Linux

284
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Can no longer talk to the new iPod

285
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Even though apparently this new iPod

286
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What is it?

287
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The nano video or whatever it is

288
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That seems to be flying off of the shells

289
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But yeah, it seems like

290
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The cooler the boxes are trying to get

291
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The more locked in and locked down

292
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
They get which is a little bit disappointing

293
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hello, I'm Mr. David from my Southeast Texas

294
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm Friday I got touch

295
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I went to the Apple store

296
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And got me a 16 gigabyte iPod touch

297
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And box parts

298
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Wait a minute, they're out already

299
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I didn't know they were out

300
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's interesting

301
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh, that was faster than I thought

302
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I thought it would be another week or so before they came out

303
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay, I don't know if they're in the UK yet

304
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll have to check

305
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Most fun, I've thought I've ever used

306
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I know you ditched your iPhone

307
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Try to turn it into a hubo

308
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, it's been worked out too good

309
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Check out the touch, it's pretty cool

310
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Got some weird things

311
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I think we need a hammer apple for

312
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And that is

313
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You can enter a contact

314
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Which can enter a calendar information

315
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Which frankly things kind of stupid

316
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Man, no kidding

317
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh man, that doesn't make any sense

318
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So it's a read-only device then

319
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Damn, why do they pull all the cool shit out, man?

320
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I thought it would let you enter neither of those before

321
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So why just one now and not the other

322
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Maybe Steve needs to give us a hundred bucks for that

323
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And

324
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And outside of that, I guess the memory

325
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And some of the videos play that kind of dark

326
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But maybe they'll fix that when the software update

327
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And you know, see you

328
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Bye

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And I went to the Apple Store online

330
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And so now they're promoting it

331
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Something feels wrong

332
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It feels like this was an afterthought

333
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Not really planned

334
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Apparently, even though they did show pictures of these devices

335
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Having Bluetooth built in

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Apparently it's not

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Which I think is a huge mistake

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Because man, how cool would it be if you could use it

339
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You know, in conjunction with your phone

340
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I mean, this Bluetooth protocol

341
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's very very smart

342
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You know, you can access your SIM card by remote

343
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You could basically turn any external device into a phone

344
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Just by using the Bluetooth protocol

345
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And sticking it actually

346
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And I now have a secondary phone

347
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Which I just stick in my bag and I use that with the Nokia

348
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And 800, which I'm loving more and more

349
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Now that I've kind of had the iPhone slash iPod touch experience

350
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I got to tell you, I got this new beautiful leather at case

351
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That kind of locks in place with magnets

352
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't know if it's available yet

353
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I have Candyman Luke hooked me up with it

354
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And I saw there was a...

355
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hold on, where was this?

356
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There was a note

357
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Let me just check for a second

358
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It looks like they're about to upgrade

359
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There we go, Mimo 4.0, the Shenuk version

360
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let me see

361
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There's something new

362
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
They're coming out with a whole new tool kit for the windows

363
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm not quite sure what's happening

364
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But I have a feeling that they're going to do a significant upgrade

365
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
On the next round, on the next release

366
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Could be very, very interesting

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And I just have to say it's a little bit...

368
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Well, it's definitely bigger than the iPhone

369
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But, you know, carrying these two devices

370
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It does kind of get me where I need to be

371
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's got all the stuff that I need in there

372
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Particularly the audio

373
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Although, of course, you know, still having trouble with quick time

374
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But it now at least will eat a lot of different MP4s

375
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And of course MP3s it does

376
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And it understands flash

377
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Not super, but it does it

378
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You know, regular flash, not a problem

379
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
When you're looking at flash video

380
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It does about a frame a second

381
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I think flash has just

382
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Has so much overhead the processors can't handle it

383
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But I'm liking it, I really am

384
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So I'm kind of back in Nokia world

385
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I have to say

386
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And, you know, I've got the iPhone sitting here

387
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And yes, I do miss that lovely browsing methodology

388
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But, you know, now that I'm using the new

389
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The new opera browsers

390
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah, you know

391
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's typical

392
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Apple always has the nice finesse

393
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And things feel good

394
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And it has always, you know, always has some beautiful

395
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
User interface

396
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You know, features

397
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But it's always missing shit

398
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There's always stuff that they have to do differently

399
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So I think from mobile I'm going to stick with the Nokia

400
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
However, seeing that leopard is coming out

401
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The new leopard, that's the new OS 10 operating system

402
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
From Apple

403
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I am pretty much convinced I'm going to be switching back to Apple

404
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
From my general laptop use

405
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
When that comes out

406
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Of course, I'm expecting that there will be new MacBook Pros

407
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
To go with it

408
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And that's what I'm going to make the switch

409
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So I'll keep you updated

410
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I mean, once again, I looked at all the

411
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
All the leopard stuff

412
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That operating system looks really, really cool

413
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm just salivating

414
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Comic strip

415
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Comic strip

416
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Comic strip

417
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Comic strip

418
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah

419
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The comment

420
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What is it?

421
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The comment to

422
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There was a ratio I thought up for comic strip

423
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Blogger comic strip bloggers

424
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Comment to something ratio

425
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Fuck

426
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Well, it's been pretty low

427
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He comments on almost every single episode in the show notes

428
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But hasn't been sending a lot of stuff until I started complaining about it

429
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And of course, here he is

430
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Joel

431
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh, I don't carry

432
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah, but the fact is the mission statement

433
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But so ink

434
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The mission statement is pissed off

435
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Comic strip blogger

436
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Well, I actually don't give a shit

437
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And then more about it

438
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But so

439
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Because you thought that

440
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Have you got my advice

441
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Ah, CSB

442
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Just because you're not seeing something live yet doesn't mean that I'm ignoring your comments

443
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But mobility

444
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The message about

445
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I was a way of immobility

446
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, well, I'm ignoring mobility

447
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, the comments

448
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah, RSS feeds for comments, yeah ignoring that

449
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Every fucking thing

450
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Ah, the fucking thing

451
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
However

452
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I would like to be your EU correspondent

453
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Again

454
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay

455
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes

456
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
CSB, of course you can be my EU correspondent

457
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And be careful what you wish for you

458
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Just might get it, you know?

459
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
By the way, dude, what's up with the microphone

460
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Sounds like you're talking into your laptop

461
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So here's my first story from you

462
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Switzerland

463
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Even so it's just not in EU

464
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Since July 2007 is Halloween

465
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Citizens of European Union

466
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
To immigrate

467
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
To migrate to Switzerland

468
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And work permits without any residence permits

469
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
freely moved to Switzerland

470
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And EU citizens can now

471
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Previously everybody had to arrange

472
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Work permit or the residence permit before coming to Switzerland

473
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Now EU citizens don't have to do it since July

474
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Ah

475
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
2007

476
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Cool

477
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Alright, so I presume

478
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah, I presume that's a good thing

479
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Even though they're not in the EU

480
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You are now allowed to go live and work in Switzerland

481
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Nice one, dude

482
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Comic strip

483
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Comic strip

484
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Comic strip

485
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Comic strip

486
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
As I said, I hooked up with race until the last night

487
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And he said there was some exciting news about the Lost Elvis Diaries

488
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Which is coming out to being published by Harper Collins

489
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Early next year and of course you will be able to get the entire Lost Elvis Diaries

490
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Exclusively before the book comes out

491
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We'll start rolling out the the episodic audio novel

492
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Which is going to be a lot of fun

493
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We of course since it encompasses Elvis's entire life

494
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Now we have

495
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We have some older Elvis

496
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And we're looking for younger Elvis

497
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Hello Mr. Curry

I don't know

528
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I think she would talk to her man

529
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm a mella kind of fella

Cook, cook, press, shut up and dress

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
She stumbles to the bar to hang with Paris

537
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Three, relax, pop and add a bit

538
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,360
To take me back to a night naps and dance

Lock me three girls, one bed, enough set

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Drug me this photo of you

542
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
You're using a bag of clothes

543
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,360
All the girls in the dance box

544
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
This is the biggest deal

545
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,360
You're using a bag of clothes

546
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
You're using a bag of clothes

547
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
You're using a bag of clothes

548
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
You're using a bag of clothes

549
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
You're using a bag of clothes

550
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
You're using a bag of clothes

551
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
You're using a bag of clothes

552
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
You're using a bag of clothes

553
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
You're using a bag of clothes

554
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
You're using a bag of clothes

555
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,360
You're using a bag of clothes

556
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
You're using a bag of clothes

557
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,360
You're using a bag of clothes

558
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
You're using a bag of clothes

559
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
And you're just making yourself with a little pop

560
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,360
Pop, pop, pop, pop

561
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Lookin' nice, actually

562
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Eyes keep this glasses

563
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:49,360
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all

564
00:21:49,360 --> 00:22:19,360
all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right

565
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:49,360
all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all left, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all, all right, all left, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right,

566
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,040
Lings, of course, the DailySourceCode.com in the show notes for today's episode, Nice, man.

567
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,120
He's got a good groove there.

568
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,360
What does he call himself?

569
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,280
Here we go, from the bio here, with the Rockstar Poor LP, Raco morphs into a persona

570
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,760
he describes best as the anti-just in Timber Lake, Nice, anything anti-like that is good

571
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
with me, my friends.

572
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,080
My mom and dad named me Kristen Roli.

573
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,800
My friends call me the nine.

574
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,120
I'm going to give you a couple of reasons why you should think of me as the American

575
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
SmartS.

576
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:34,560
I support Pork, the other weapon of mass destruction.

577
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,040
Is everything Nealcon with you?

578
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,400
Hey, you know what Nealcon got me, you know where I am today.

579
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Which is where?

580
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
We're tired.

581
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,120
My only girlfriend is Satan.

582
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,680
I like the way that sounds Sean Hannick, who's a real moron, as far as I'm concerned.

583
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,120
I've never met a more unpleasant man than Sean Hannick.

584
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
We're going to be hand-attized.

585
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,720
I desperately need to be protected.

586
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,320
I need to be sanitized and immunized from your Hannickization.

587
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:10,040
The American SmartS available at iTunes, Pod Show, our own website, smartass.hellocignetwork.com

588
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:16,280
or you can subscribe to our feed, feeds.feedburner.com forward slash the American SmartS.

589
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:22,720
Shortcut TAS, the American SmartS, of course I look at TAS and think true air speed,

590
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,960
but that's just me.

591
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,520
Yeah, I gotta tell you ever since September 11th, the most recent September 11th, you know,

592
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:36,720
talked a little bit about some of the conspiracy theories that are out there and about

593
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,160
demolition of the towers and there's so much going on and last night I was talking to Patricia

594
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,800
about as we were in bed and I'm like, you know, do you believe in all these conspiracy theories?

595
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,400
And she's real intuitive about stuff.

596
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,120
She says, now this whole thing, this is like a bitch slap fest between Bin Laden and Bush.

597
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
It's a personal thing.

598
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
It's between families.

599
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,040
And so I kept taking her down the road and said, okay, why?

600
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,800
And she said, well, it's about money, it's about oil.

601
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,160
So why did we go to Iraq?

602
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,920
Well, you know, and before you know, you're stuck in a couple of conspiracies.

603
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,080
And I think we need to explore this a little bit more, but not, not in the way that everybody's

604
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
doing it.

605
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,240
I've seen at probably most of the videos.

606
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,000
I've been reading tons and tons of books and I have to say now that I'm almost done with

607
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,520
legacy of ashes, the history of the CIA, it's pretty clear that throughout, you know,

608
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:39,880
the past 100 years, the United States government or the clandestine agencies that are contained

609
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,080
within it, which I would have to say, RCA and FEMA, actually, I consider those guys to be

610
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,160
pretty much black box, a black box agency.

611
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,920
It's clear they're willing to do a lot to stir up shit in other countries for sure.

612
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,480
And there's, you know, there's pretty much proof of plans that have been out there to

613
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,840
cause crap on the American soil.

614
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,960
And I'm really looking for, for some insight.

615
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
I'm not looking for rehashed videos.

616
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,840
I'm, you know, I'm looking for just for some, some conversation about, I'm not quite

617
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,240
sure how to approach it because before you know, you wind up in the whole conspiracy theory.

618
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,840
And then there's the Aluminati in the new world order and all this stuff, man, I mean,

619
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,280
it really be true.

620
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:31,360
And I'll be really hypnotized by the Montauk project, you know, I don't feel hypnotized.

621
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,400
Maybe that's why they, uh, why they ban marijuana because people who smoke it probably

622
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,560
you have too much clarity.

623
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,880
Hi, Adam, it's Gary Alexander from Las Vegas, I'm the ultimate podcast.

624
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,280
That was a new video, podcast that I'm doing the combat zone.

625
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,880
Oh man, you got to see his latest episode of the combat zone, he's got a hot fighter on

626
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
there.

627
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,760
I'm coming on the search, uh, the new site right this is the new search at podshow.com

628
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
searching shows.

629
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Yeah.

630
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,320
Application that you guys have in the minute, yes, I'm also having trouble with this huge

631
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,720
space between the results and the top of the page.

632
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:14,400
And that seems to be when I, when I use Safari as my browser, I think it'd be honest

633
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
with you.

634
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,400
I've always had issues, different issues, but I always had issues when I used Safari

635
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,400
on the site.

636
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,560
When I pull up Safari and view a page in podshow, it is very awkward compared to whenever

637
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:33,640
I pull up Firefox and view the same page much, much different experience there.

638
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,240
So, you know, I don't know if that's something that you guys are very familiar with and

639
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,880
just kind of accept and want us to accept.

640
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,600
Well, you know, that's a good point.

641
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,040
So what I did is I fired up Safari, uh, the Windows version of Safari, I guess that's

642
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
3.0.

643
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
And you're right.

644
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Maybe the problem.

645
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,520
I see the banner shows up first before the search results.

646
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
That's wrong.

647
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:01,600
I'm pretty sure that I thought that we were also checking and doing QA on Safari.

648
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
This is the problem.

649
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,800
You know, this is exactly the shit that we dropped into with all these different browsers.

650
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,800
You know, I thought the browser wars were over, but oh no, they all implement things

651
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,320
just a little bit differently, which means you got to have a whole cycle, you know,

652
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,120
God forbid, uh, the opera browser gains some traction, which I think it actually might be

653
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,000
certainly on mobile devices, same problem, you know, you've got to have a whole cycle of

654
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,960
a team that that looks for compatibility with, uh, with the, with the Safari browser

655
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,160
and then ultimately I'm sure with the, uh, with the opera browser and that has to be QAed

656
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,760
and it's, uh, it takes an incredible amount of resources to do this, particularly when you're

657
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,720
using a lot of Ajax stuff, so sucks, sucks, I'll talk to the team about it, though,

658
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
for sure.

659
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,120
But that's just something I did want to point out.

660
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:58,520
I also learned to point out, uh, big episode on my, on my video show, become as um,

661
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
with Gina Carano.

662
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,760
She just called on Showtime here in the state session, she was, she called on Hawaii,

663
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,120
I won by submission, or at a way for a girl to win, right, by submission, for your naked

664
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
joke, is that?

665
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,800
And, um, you should check that out, I'll set you a link to it, and one, everybody, if

666
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:20,760
you want to see a hot, hot female fighter who can kick your ass, check out Gina Carano

667
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:28,080
on the combat zone, all right, all right, well, yeah, mom, yeah, of course.

668
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,560
I'm starting to believe this red pill blue pill stuff, let me tell you, I really am.

669
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,680
I don't, I think that I'm still in, like, a purple stage, I don't think I've completely

670
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,480
chumped down the whole red pill, and you're not, I'm seeing all these huge conspiracies

671
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,600
and we're living under, you know, we're being oppressed.

672
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,840
And the world is about to be taken over by a small group of families and the Council of

673
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
300.

674
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,280
We are in deep shit, deep deep shit.

675
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,120
Well, I'll just keep it real.

676
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,360
We got, we got bigger problems than new world order.

677
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
We've got iTunes problems.

678
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,720
Hey, Adam, Jesse and your hamster, you're saying here, I was thinking you might

679
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,880
be able to answer a question I have, every, it's pretty regular now that the podcast

680
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:16,920
that I'm so subscribed to will, and I use iTunes as a pod catcher, and I haven't set

681
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:24,760
up so that once I play a podcast, it disappears and goes away, and next time my iPod

682
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:31,280
thinks it's no longer on the iPod, but all the time, all of a sudden, I'll think one day,

683
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:39,280
like 30, 20, 10, all that episode of a show, we'll show back up, just happened for your

684
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,280
show.

685
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:47,720
It's happened for other independent as well as sort of math produced podcast, and it's

686
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,400
a hassle to go back and delete those 30 podcasts, especially when it's happened all the

687
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
time.

688
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,160
So I wonder, is that an iTunes problem?

689
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:01,240
Was that a problem with the person that puts out the podcast or is that my problem?

690
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,280
You like you could set on that, it would be great.

691
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Yeah.

692
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,160
Well, this is, that's kind of hard to say, whether it's an iTunes problem or some other

693
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
kind of problem.

694
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:17,160
It's really all about the implementation of RSS and the GUID, the global unique identifier,

695
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,360
I think, is what that stands for.

696
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,120
Makes it very complicated to get it right all the time, you know, and what will happen

697
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,000
is sometimes you'll have a system refresh, a new upgrade.

698
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,760
I've seen this happen, it's certainly happened to Pod Show.

699
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,720
I think I've seen it happen with the feed burner as well, and, you know, what happens

700
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,640
is it looks like there's a new feed or a new published date or somehow, I mean, it can

701
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,240
be a very small change that can affect the way your pod catcher in this case, so iTunes,

702
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,960
the way it reacts and what it thinks it's supposed to do and what it thinks it's seeing.

703
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,440
Of course, you know, all these systems are dumb systems, right?

704
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,760
They're just looking for rule-based stuff.

705
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,720
And if something changes that hits the rule set, then it's going to go and redown load.

706
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,440
It's an incredible waste of resources.

707
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,000
I hate it when it happens to us, and I think it happened certainly in the past two or

708
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,880
three months, I've seen it happen.

709
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,120
We're all of a sudden, a whole bunch of older episodes start showing up, and yeah, we try

710
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,560
to be very careful about that, but sometimes shit just happens.

711
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,880
I think that's really it.

712
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,760
Shit happens, you know, this is a relatively new technology.

713
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,520
It can be implemented in a number of ways, of course, typically when people implement

714
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:37,720
the lazy way, which is the way I would program stuff, being a shitty software engineer,

715
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,360
then stuff, it's breakage, essentially.

716
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,800
It's something, you know, the new Nokia, the N800 video center, I think there's a video

717
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:53,080
center for N95, but for N800, here's something I discovered, it's really stupid and

718
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,160
it's broken, it's just an implementation, and by the way, you know, the Nokia guys,

719
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,440
and the guys who work on this stuff, in conjunction with Nokia, you know, they're smart,

720
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,720
they're smart developers, so guess what happens?

721
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,200
If you're subscribed to, so I have a couple channels set up, then it actually comes pre-installed

722
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,920
with pod show channels, with specially encoded videos that really perform well on the

723
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:24,680
N800, if you have a show in two separate channels, or if you're subscribed to these

724
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:32,880
show to the show twice, well, that's a bad example, regardless, it downloads stuff,

725
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,080
you can play it on the fly, but also download stuff, if the same show in same episode

726
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:43,080
is in a different feed, it will download the episode again, so you literally will have

727
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,440
the same episode twice, which is broken, I mean, it should say, wait a minute, this is the same

728
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:54,360
episode, and it should not be downloading that a second time, so I think it was day one

729
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,560
or that said, we make shitty software, so I guess we all do, so just trying to make it better.

730
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:05,760
Hopefully, just talking about it, will help our brethren who are the software engineers,

731
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,880
look man, they're just trying to figure it out themselves, you know, you can't figure

732
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,600
out every single use case or scenario that someone's going to use this stuff, it's

733
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,200
hard, it's hard, hard work.

734
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,160
All right, last song, this one just added to the Podsafe Music Network, as far as I can

735
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:27,160
recall, this song was originally written by Howard Jones, and of course, is on the PMN,

736
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:32,120
he also has his own podcast, and I pick this link up from Nigel Pace, who, as you know,

737
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,240
has become kind of the independent promoter of awesome Podsafe Music, I focus a lot

738
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,560
on the UK stuff, but basically worldwide, he's kicking ass, and I love getting

739
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,600
promoted by him, essentially, I have no idea how his business model works other than

740
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,520
he's an independent promoter for podcasters and independent producers and is really working.

741
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:59,840
This is Katrina Carlson with the classic Howard Jones song, and I just got to believe

742
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,800
that Howard produced it, and I think I hear him in the background somewhere, have a listen.

743
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:29,960
Here you can look at the menu, but you just can't eat, you can feel the cushions, but

744
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:38,560
you can't have a seat, you can dip your foot in the pool, but you can't have a swim, you can

745
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:48,320
feel the punishment, but you can't commit a sin, and you want her, and she wants you,

746
00:35:48,320 --> 00:36:14,080
and she wants you, and she wants you, and no one, no one, no one ever is to blame, is to blame

747
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:25,560
you can be the mansion, but you just can't live in it, you're the fastest runner, but

748
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:35,760
she's not allowed to win some break the rules, they live to kill the cost, the insecurities,

749
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:48,000
the thing that won't get lost and you want her, and she wants you, we want everyone,

750
00:36:48,000 --> 00:37:09,640
and she wants you, and no one, no one, no one ever is to blame, we want every chance,

751
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:33,960
you can't have an opportunity, you can't have a chance, is to blame, you can see the summit that

752
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:42,200
you can't reach it, it's the last piece of the puzzle, but you just can't make it fit, doctor says you're

753
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:50,840
cured, but you still feel the pain, aspirations in the clouds, but your thoughts go down between

754
00:37:50,840 --> 00:38:20,760
and you want her, and she wants you, we want everyone, and she wants you, no one, no one, no one ever is to blame,

755
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:37,760
no one ever is to blame, is to blame,

756
00:38:50,760 --> 00:39:04,120
in that pretty great song remains a great song Katrina Carlson no one is to blame you can

757
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,440
find a link to that the pot set music network from the show notes a daily source code.com

758
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:14,840
just reading through the the upgrade notes here for the new I guess it's the new the new version

759
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:21,800
of the the any hundred operating system here it is I want to read this to you because

760
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,400
you developers out there might like this the main reasons in Shenukh that's the code name

761
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,000
for the new and our external alignment with the genome and Linux baseline is a top priority this is

762
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,680
why here we go memo is moving to GTK which I think stands for the genome toolkit

763
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:49,240
two dot one zero and g lib c I don't know that's libraries I don't know exactly how it works I guess

764
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,040
they're integrating the Hilden project so I think what this means is that we're going to have

765
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:02,760
some great looking applications try true and tested so excited about that actually yeah that's I must

766
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,560
say every single new release of that thing has been more excited about and and I just love the industrial

767
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,360
ness of it I've dropped this thing so many times it's still just plugging away doing its job

768
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,920
all right everybody I got a pack up it's almost 11 o'clock I get to get my ass out to
