I like to think I'm flying into the future, I like to think I'm flying into the future,

51
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,320
I like to think I'm flying into the future,

52
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,320
do you usually watch or do you ever watch or really watch ahead,

53
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
one minute,

54
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Give me the 9th club, the George Benz, the 9th of the set, he's going off, daily source code 695 and guess what?

55
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:16,320
I'm still in San Francisco. That's right, coming to you from Recondo. It's Monday evening, so Tuesday and Australia, just picking up the show.

56
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,320
And the reason I'm here is it's actually all good reasons I told you it was going to be crazy until the end of the year.

57
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,320
And I was right, so we got some lots of stuff that I'm still going to do this week.

58
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Here at Pod Show HQ, there's a lot of other things that are not good in my friends. First of all, I have been as sick as a freaking dog for the past 48 hours.

59
00:05:42,320 --> 00:06:03,320
I mean, like, I have not been this sick for five or six years, at least 2000, let me see 2002 probably. Oh, yeah, it's I mean, and I waited so I didn't do a show yesterday, which would have arrived in your on your computer or on your iPod or whatever Monday.

60
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Because I was basically just trying to stay alive. It sucks when you're sick and, you know, and you have no family around you, your wife's not there to make that great chicken soup with ginger, not that I could use any chicken soup at the moment right now.

61
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:32,320
And, you know, so I waited probably about 48 hours and I got to do a show. I got so much to talk about and lo and behold, the cramping starts. It's like I'm having contractions, man. This is horrible. Anyway, we'll talk about that later. I'm sure you weren't about it all in depth.

62
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:47,320
But the, but there was a real full bar, a real full bar or we call it element to to this past Friday. I was actually supposed to fly back to Europe and there was a reunion.

63
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Well, I wasn't really the reunion, but the the pirate radio station that I worked at in the early 80s, decibel radio and Amsterdam.

64
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:01,320
They had, well, so there was a new, they were kind of like relaunching decibel radio.

65
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:08,320
As a couple of guys had just gotten a commercial license to start a station in north and south of Holland.

66
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,320
So basically Amsterdam, and then I think Rotterdam is where you can hear this station.

67
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,320
And it's called decibel radio and they were using you. The whole vibe, the whole jingle is the assets.

68
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:23,320
And so this whole relaunch and all the old jocks from 25, 30 years ago when it come together, everyone who worked at the station.

69
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:31,320
And of course, I really wanted to be there. But you know, having had to pull the trigger on making a decision to stay here.

70
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
I couldn't make that.

71
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,320
However, good friend of the Charlie Ray, who does send me these montages from time to time.

72
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,320
I haven't had a chance to use this previous one, which is really intended for me in the Lady Patricia.

73
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,320
He sent me one regarding this very reunion. And I thought, I'll let you take take a listen to that.

74
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,320
It's about four minutes. And I'll just grab a little visit to the little boys room.

75
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
I'll be right back.

76
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Hi Adam. It's a new ray on the Charlie.

77
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Although you've deleted number four, I'm not that kind of guy who gives up very easily.

78
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,320
So this is number five. How are you doing?

79
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,320
As you know, there will be a big party in Amsterdam this Saturday in the escape.

80
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:28,320
And I've just received the VIP invitation for the kickoff party from the legend who will return this Friday at $1,600.

81
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,320
It's the future radio station in the Netherlands.

82
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Descible radio started in 1977 as an illegal radio station on an attic in Amsterdam.

83
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,320
It was the biggest radio station in Amsterdam.

84
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:51,320
It was D.B. Radio, who invited Mr. Adam Curry to develop his vocal maturity and become one of the best disc jarkies in Holland.

85
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,320
My country was just too little for the part father.

86
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,320
This weekend there will be a restart of Descible Radio and Adam will host a kickoff on Friday.

87
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,320
So I talked to the big bus and next week I hope to become one of the newest generation disc jarkies in Descible Radio.

88
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,320
The station that probably tickles you at him with a lot of memories.

89
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,320
So your biggest fan from Holland has got three quick questions to share with all your Charlie friends around the world.

90
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Question number one.

91
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,320
What was the most important thing why Descible Radio became so popular in the 80s?

92
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
Without a doubt the music too.

93
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,320
How are you preparing yourself for this exciting weekend?

94
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,320
I'm cute. I just realized that probably the biggest part of your Charlie friends never heard it to you in the early 80s.

95
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
True.

96
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
So here's another thing.

97
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Let's all take a trip down memory lane.

98
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Right now it's going to be fun.

99
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
But we'll dad embarrass you Adam.

100
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
A little bit probably.

101
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Come on, hump on board.

102
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Let's go back to Amsterdam.

103
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
1883.

104
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Adam was 19 years old.

105
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Um, excuse me.

106
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Thanks. Once more.

107
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Um, could everybody do this?

108
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Yeah, there you go.

109
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Everybody can come down in the studio.

110
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,320
This studio can only, you know, you put four people in here.

111
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
It's full.

112
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I mean, like, so, uh, because somebody called to get us a book of records, please.

113
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Here's the news.

114
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Can you hear that?

115
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,320
I think this was, uh,

116
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
I think this was a New Year's Eve celebration.

117
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
It's almost time.

118
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm going to pop the cork on the champagne.

119
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,320
By the way, my alice was John Holden.

120
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Oh, my lady.

121
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Oh, lady.

122
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
I want to first kiss.

123
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
I don't know.

124
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
You can have the first kiss.

125
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
But we need a countdown here.

126
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Wait a minute.

127
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
10.

128
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320

Yeah, it's easy.

156
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Go how much you grew to there, Linda?

157
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Yeah, I want to do my creatures to try and shoot

158
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Keep her from the law for cleaning.

159
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
The biggest greatest in the oldest rocker roll star.

160
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
The little prince.

161
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Where do we go from here?

162
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Oh my god.

163
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
What the hell?

164
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Why do you have to be a hard-greater?

165
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Four teams has the hour, four teams has nine.

166
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Eight teams with, uh, what's the mind?

167
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Oh yeah, that's october, right?

168
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Yeah.

169
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Still a little bit sleepy.

170
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
If you're working to be in your car.

171
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Good morning to you.

172
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
No, we can radio.

173
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
One, ninety six point two.

174
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Culture club.

175
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
The culture club room.

176
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
The album kissing to be clever.

177
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
On version records and tape.

178
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
We have a fabulous morning and about 12 minutes here.

179
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
You can do it one, eight, four, one, six, eight.

180
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,320
But of course you've been dialed that same number right now.

181
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
And we're back.

182
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
We've got a thousand seven.

183
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
We had a big party coming up this Saturday for both of us.

184
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,320
So, the final third quick question for you, Adam.

185
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Can I buy you a drink?

186
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
Alright, thank you very much.

187
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
That was quite embarrassing.

188
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
What a voice, huh?

189
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Boy.

190
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
I don't even think I was nineteen.

191
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
I think I was seventeen or eighteen at the time, honestly.

192
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Yeah, so the guys that have, uh, had a live stream.

193
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,320
So it was very surreal to sit here Saturday.

194
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
And it, whether it was pretty shitty.

195
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
So I went out, did some grocery shopping.

196
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
I wasn't feeling that hot, but I wasn't really sick yet.

197
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Um, you know, then I listened to, uh, a basic listen to the stream.

198
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
They also had a studio cam.

199
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
So I could see all these guys and of course, uh,

200
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,320
everyone was much fatter than they used to be in a lot balder.

201
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
I even went out, uh,

202
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
doing some grocery shopping.

203
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
And, uh, I hooked up the Nokia N-810.

204
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Uh, through Bluetooth to my E-61I.

205
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
I used that basically as a data modem.

206
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,320
And I listened to the stream while walking down the street here in San Francisco.

207
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
That was a pretty cool cyber experience.

208
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
You know, thinking the 25, 30 years.

209
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,320
After I used that literally climb on top of the building to adjust the antenna.

210
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,320
But now, uh, you know, 5,000 miles away.

211
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
I'm actually receiving this wirelessly through the air.

212
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
And I was a head trip.

213
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
And it was a little bit, um,

214
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
how can I say?

215
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
It was emotional.

216
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
It was very weird.

217
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
They're also really, really sucked.

218
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Anyway, what can you say?

219
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
And, uh,

220
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
So then you're kind of,

221
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
uh, Saturday night,

222
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,320
I didn't sleep a wink at, uh,

223
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
and like two o'clock in the morning.

224
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Uh, my daughter texted me.

225
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
She needed something.

226
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
You know, the cat had gone missing.

227
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,320
And Patricia was, because I was supposed to be with Patricia in Amsterdam.

228
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Patricia had a different engagement.

229
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
She was going to, uh,

230
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,320
some show that they've asked her perhaps to perform in, uh,

231
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
in the new year.

232
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
And so she was going to, you know,

233
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
take a look at this show.

234
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
And, um,

235
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
you know, and then she, uh,

236
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
she called me at 7 a.m.

237
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
You know, it's always funny,

238
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
because, you know,

239
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
when I went back home in the UK,

240
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
and uh,

241
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,320
someone from the San Francisco office calls it like 10 o'clock or something like that, you know,

242
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
so the girls would say,

243
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
well, don't they ever,

244
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
don't they ever think about the time difference?

245
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
I had low and behold.

246
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,320
No one does a really good job at it, I guess.

247
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Um, before I get into Sunday,

248
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
let's listen to this.

249
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
This is one of my favorite promos.

250
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Happens every year.

251
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Happy to do it.

252
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Great show.

253
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Ah, Christmas.

254
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Christmas.

255
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Christmas.

256
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Hi, I'm Steve Wad.

257
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Seems like a lot of people are trying to replace the word Christmas with the word,

258
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
holiday.

259
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Yeah.

260
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Well, I'm here to say that I'm happy to celebrate Christmas,

261
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
and I invite you to as well.

262
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Join in the fun as my co-host,

263
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
James Cooper from yChristmas.com.

264
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
And I take a look at Christmas

265
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
and some of the customs,

266
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
traditions,

267
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
and reasons for Christmas,

268
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,320
on the Lifespring Why Christmas Show.

269
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Want to be part of the fun?

270
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
We would love to have you on the show.

271
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
If you have the favorite Christmas memory,

272
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
record an MP3 and send it to me at

273
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,320
LifespringYChristmasatGmail.com.

274
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
Make it about two minutes long,

275
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
make it family safe,

276
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
and it just might end up on the show.

277
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,320
You can be a part of the Christmas tradition.

278
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,320
Come check out the show at LifespringWhyChristmas.com.

279
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
It is a very Christmas.

280
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Yeah.

281
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
What is it now, Steve?

282
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Three years we've been doing this?

283
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
I love them, man.

284
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
It is a very good show.

285
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,320
You're this Christmas show of Lifespring.

286
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
It really puts me into the spirit.

287
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Merry Christmas to you, my friend.

288
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,320
So it's hard to pinpoint exactly

289
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,320
when I started feeling so ill.

290
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
And it wasn't...

291
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
I'm pretty sure it's really one of these

292
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
flu bugs that's been floating around,

293
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
that I've just been lucky,

294
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
not to get it, and it's been a very tiring week.

295
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
I haven't slept well.

296
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
And so, you know, some germs roam around,

297
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
go on.

298
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
I look at this motherfucker.

299
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
I like to jump on him.

300
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
And they got to me.

301
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,320
But it was kind of coincidentally.

302
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,320
It happened while I was watching a movie.

303
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,320
It's a...

304
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,320
A dramatized documentary about Abbey Hoffman.

305
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Abbey Hoffman was a radical protester,

306
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,320
actually a professional demonstration organizer

307
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
in the 70s, 60s and 70s.

308
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
And I'm very familiar with Abbey Hoffman

309
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
because when I was...

310
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Gosh, I'm gonna say maybe 9 or 10.

311
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
And this was without a doubt,

312
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,320
a part of my...

313
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,320
this... this formed a part of my...

314
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
of me.

315
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,320
My overall DNA.

316
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,320
We were just living in the Netherlands.

317
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Had been there for maybe two years.

318
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
And there was the Americans' Women's Club.

319
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,320
My mom was a member of the American Women's Club.

320
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,320
And it was a pretty senseless organization, probably.

321
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
But, you know, it was a way for...

322
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,320
There was probably a hundred American families

323
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
over in Holland at the time.

324
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
A lot of them from Texas instruments.

325
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Another company's like this.

326
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,320
It was just starting to go into these new open European markets.

327
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
Ah, excuse me.

328
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,320
And... did you just think Sensei or like I did?

329
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
I can't help it.

330
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
And they had a library.

331
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
You know, their own library.

332
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Essentially, the women would bring in all the books

333
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
that they had already read,

334
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
or that they had laying around the house and wanted to clean up.

335
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
And so they created their own library, which was nice.

336
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,320
I used to go with my mom to the American Women's Club.

337
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
And I'd walk around the library and there was this book.

338
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
And this book said steal this book.

339
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,320
And I'm like, holy crap, this is great.

340
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,320
And it was really kind of a guide,

341
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,320
a guide to gorilla warfare, if you will.

342
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,320
You know, and how to organize demonstrations

343
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,320
and how to, you know, really have an effect

344
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,320
with doing something to change the country, the world, etc.

345
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
And I didn't know much about Adby Hoffman,

346
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
but this book was fantastic.

347
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,320
It told you how to, you know, how to survive on no money.

348
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,320
If you're like a fugitive, which, you know, watching this documentary,

349
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
this drama, I should say,

350
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,320
it's a Jeanine Garofflo place as girlfriend in it.

351
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
So it's really well done.

352
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
I actually have found it on,

353
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,320
I don't know how I came up with looking for it for it.

354
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,320
But I know I did a Google search and there was a Google video.

355
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
I'll see if I can put a link to it in the show notes

356
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,320
at dailysourcecode.com.

357
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,320
And so I watched it about two hours,

358
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,320
an hour and a half hour and 45 minutes.

359
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
And it was really fascinating.

360
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,320
This guide actually, I think, did effect.

361
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,320
You know, did stops, did stop the war in Vietnam.

362
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Or it certainly had an effect on the thinking of the country.

363
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
And, you know, it was the hippies.

364
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
It was the summer of love.

365
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,320
And it really delves into, and this is kind of one generation

366
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,320
before me or half a generation before me.

367
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Yet a little bit younger than my parents.

368
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,320
And it was, it was fascinating to watch.

369
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
And I just, you know, and I just started thinking,

370
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
like, wow, you know, we really do something like that.

371
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
You know, something else I remember from this book,

372
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,320
was to coordinate a simultaneous toilet flush.

373
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
You know, if you end the theory there is,

374
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,320
I don't know if that still holds true with today's,

375
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,320
supposedly upgraded infrastructure,

376
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,320
but the theory is that if you get an entire city to flush,

377
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,320
they're totally at the same time at a given moment

378
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,320
that there would literally be shit roaming through the streets

379
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
because the, you know,

380
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,320
the infrastructure of the sewer system wouldn't be able to handle it.

381
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
It was that kind of stuff.

382
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Yeah, it was really, I enjoyed it very much.

383
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
And it really awakened part of the revolutionary in me.

384
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
If you can get a hand, your hands on it.

385
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,320
I'll see, maybe Amazon hasn't.

386
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
I'll see if they have a copy of it,

387
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
no link to it.

388
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
I'll be Hoffman's steal this book.

389
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
And so I started thinking, you know,

390
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,320
and thinking about Ron Paul, thinking about,

391
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,320
and also, you know, just because I was home

392
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
and I wasn't feeling well, I had the television on.

393
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
And kind of just say one thing,

394
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
if you want to help your country at all,

395
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
if you want to do anything,

396
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
the first thing I do was turn off your frickin' TV.

397
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
This is bad.

398
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,320
What's going on with American television today is,

399
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
it's just atrocious.

400
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
And it's meant to distract your attention

401
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,320
from anything remotely possible.

402
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
And we could go into how that works,

403
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
but another time, maybe,

404
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
because having worked in American media,

405
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
I know that there's no grand scheme,

406
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
there's no master plan.

407
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
It's just how it is.

408
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
There's influence.

409
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
And you follow that influence,

410
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
because that's what you do.

411
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,320
And it's all based upon greed,

412
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,320
greed, or should we call it,

413
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
maybe greed is not the right word.

414
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
A vanity, maybe that's better.

415
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
You know, in the media business,

416
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
everyone wants to be on top.

417
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Everyone wants to be the man, everyone wants to be the superstar.

418
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
How do you get there?

419
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,320
Well, either you really, really go for it,

420
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
like Madonna did,

421
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
and you're bitch all the way to the top,

422
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
which is a very tiring way to do it,

423
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
or like most people.

424
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
You know, you kind of go with the flow.

425
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
And so that's how stuff doesn't get on the air

426
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
and things that aren't important,

427
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
for instance, finding out that,

428
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
guess what, turned out Iran isn't actually

429
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
making nuclear weapons.

430
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
But of course, this is already being spun

431
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
into, well, you know,

432
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,320
they could have the capability by 2012, 2015,

433
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,320
so we still got to do something about that.

434
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
This is bad news.

435
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
So, of course,

436
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
I'm basically laying down on the couch,

437
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
and I'm like,

438
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
I don't want to get up,

439
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
and I'll feel too good.

440
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,320
Let me Google around.

441
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,320
And what is really the root of all of our problems?

442
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
You know, me, I like to follow the money.

443
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
I believe that the only way we can get anyone

444
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
elected in this country is if we have enough money,

445
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
and that's actually going quite well

446
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
with Ron Paul's campaign.

447
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,320
Of course, we'll hit the $12 million easily.

448
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
I think we'll go over it.

449
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,320
December 16th, the Boston Tea Party Tea Party 07.com.

450
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,320
So, we're going to do another money bomb for Ron Paul.

451
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,320
So, Senator, there'll be plenty of opportunity to advertise,

452
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
which is the way we'd like presidents

453
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
in these United States is through commercials.

454
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Another reason why I don't want you watching television.

455
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,320
So, when else might have better commercials.

456
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
And, you know,

457
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,320
just letting my thoughts go free and thinking about stuff,

458
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
and I eventually came up with a phrase

459
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
that I've heard mentioned a lot.

460
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
And I think it was probably,

461
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
while I was on the Abbey Hoffman page

462
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,320
on the Google video that I saw in your related videos.

463
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,320
And it was a video of President Eisenhower,

464
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
his exit speech in 1961.

465
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
So, he'd been president for eight years.

466
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
It was time for him to leave.

467
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,320
And he addressed the nation in a televised speech.

468
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
And this was where the phrase,

469
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
the military industrial complex was coined.

470
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
And I just want to play that for you

471
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
just so you can listen to it

472
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
because I want to talk about it.

473
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
This is...

474
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States.

475
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
As I said from now on.

476
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
Good evening.

477
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

478
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
we now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century

479
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,320
that has witnessed four major wars among great nations.

480
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
Until the latest of our world conflicts,

481
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,320
the United States had no armaments industry.

482
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,320
American makers of Plouch Airs could

483
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,320
with time and as required, make swords as well.

484
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,320
But we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense.

485
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,360
We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry

486
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,320
of vast proportions.

487
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
I did do this.

488
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense established.

489
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment

490
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,320
and a large arms industry is new in the American experience.

491
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,320
The total influence, economic, political, even spiritual

492
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,320
is felt in every city, every state house,

493
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
every office of the federal government.

494
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,320
We recognize the imperative need for this development.

495
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,320
Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.

496
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved.

497
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,320
So is the very structure of our society.

498
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
In the councils of government,

499
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,320
we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,

500
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,320
whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex.

501
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,320
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists

502
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
and will persist.

503
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,320
We must never let the weight of this combination in danger or liberties

504
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
or democratic processes.

505
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
We should take nothing for granted.

506
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,320
Only an alert and knowledgeable citizen can compel

507
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,320
the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense

508
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,320
with our peaceful, methods and goals.

509
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,320
So that security and liberty may prosper together.

510
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
Sounds a bit like a science fiction flick, doesn't it?

511
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Well, it's not.

512
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
It's real.

513
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
It was a real president.

514
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
The president that, as far as I can tell,

515
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
everyone really loved and thought was good.

516
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
And he came from the military.

517
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
He was generalized an hour.

518
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
He knew what was going on.

519
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,320
And this is exactly what has happened.

520
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,320
What he won for has now taken place because

521
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
and this is from my own experiences.

522
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
So I do have some firsthand knowledge of this.

523
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,320
First of all, Dick Cheney, part of the military industrial complex

524
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
is vice president, right?

525
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,320
And the way Washington works as I'm learning now

526
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
and as I delve into a deeper and I have, you know,

527
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
of course you, uh,

528
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,320
and it'll be bumping the Alex Jones's info wars.com.

529
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
And there's all kinds of, you know, stuff out there.

530
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
But just for my own,

531
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
distilled, rationalized perspective.

532
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
This has happened.

533
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,320
The military industrial complex has taken over so much money

534
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,320
is being made on any war.

535
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
And of course, there's a couple of them going on

536
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
that were involved in one way or the other.

537
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
For, you know,

538
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,320
not just making war weaponry.

539
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,320
But this is kind of the hidden, you know,

540
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,320
the hidden fact of this war of the Iraq war

541
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
is that there are so many companies

542
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,320
involved in the servicing of what's taking place.

543
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,320
I mean, no longer do we have soldiers who are on KP duty.

544
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
You know, there's no one who has to

545
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
peel potatoes.

546
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
No, it's catered.

547
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,320
When I was in Bosra in 2003,

548
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
I couldn't believe my eyes.

549
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,320
When I saw the base 5,000

550
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
troops in this one base in Bosra

551
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
and they had a burger king,

552
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
they had a pizza hut, they had a full on

553
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
diner with a great salad bar.

554
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
I might point out.

555
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
You know, these,

556
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,320
our troops have now become high-tech troops.

557
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
You know, there's like, they're like athletes almost.

558
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
This is really disgusting to think about it.

559
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
But also very science fictiony.

560
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
You know, they, you know,

561
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
everything is done for them.

562
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
They're serviced in every single way.

563
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,320
And of course, there's more private soldiers.

564
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
They're all not for a second.

565
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
In Iraq than there are,

566
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
in listed men and women.

567
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,320
And this is costing us billions and billions of dollars.

568
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,320
And every corporation is intended to make profit and prosper.

569
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,320
So, you know, and then eventually get taken over

570
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
or take over.

571
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
What are the two?

572
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,320
So it's in the DNA of companies to find war.

573
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Now, if those companies are represented in our government,

574
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,320
which, of course, is almost exactly like show business.

575
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
You know, where people come in

576
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
and they don't want to ruffle too many feathers.

577
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
They want to climb up the ladder.

578
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
And you've got these lobbyists.

579
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
And you've got money flowing in.

580
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,320
And everyone is controlled one way or the other.

581
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,320
And it's a slave of the system.

582
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,320
And so, I conclude from that that it actually

583
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,320
doesn't matter who our president is anymore.

584
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,320
It does not matter unless

585
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,320
unless the people step up to the plate as well.

586
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
So, what you're seeing right now on television

587
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
and why do you still have this thing on?

588
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
I told you to turn it off.

589
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,320
What you see is a show.

590
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,320
It's a show just to keep us occupied

591
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
because it doesn't matter.

592
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Whether a Democrat or a Republican,

593
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
whoever becomes president,

594
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
everything in this whole system is set up

595
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
to continuously create revenue

596
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
for the military industrial complex.

597
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Now, that doesn't mean that I'm giving up on the presidential elections,

598
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
but I do have some thoughts about it.

599
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
Now, as you know, I'm endorsing Ron Paul

600
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,320
and Scott sent in the following comment.

601
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
Hello, Adam.

602
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,320
It's a scotch.

603
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
It's a scotch.

604
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
It's a scotch.

605
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
It's a scotch.

606
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,320
Hello, Adam.

607
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,320
It's a scotch of the uncommon sense podcast on Podgeau.

608
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,320
I like yourself, would like to see Ron Paul

609
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,320
get a chance to turn this country around.

610
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,320
I was thinking out loud on my podcast

611
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
recently here about the whole way

612
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,320
that our elective system works.

613
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
You know, we've got computer modeling programs

614
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
that they're using now,

615
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
that are just getting incredibly

616
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
deadly accurate at predicting

617
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
how a change in position

618
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,320
will change the number of people voting for you.

619
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
Yeah, you know what this is?

620
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
It's the same software we use in television.

621
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,320
The same software and same,

622
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,320
maybe not exactly the same software,

623
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
but it's the same algorithms we used to determine

624
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
how will movie ends?

625
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
You know, even though the director and the writer

626
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,320
might have intended it one way,

627
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,320
we can get a bigger box office

628
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,320
if we change that.

629
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
That's the same software.

630
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
It's the same algorithms.

631
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,320
It's been used since the 50s since television began.

632
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Absolutely right.

633
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,320
It's just like weather or forecasting or modeling.

634
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
They know the demographics in the country.

635
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
They know how many gays.

636
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
They can basically divide up the entire population.

637
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
Yeah, they know who went to college

638
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,320
and everything.

639
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,320
Absolutely.

640
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
And a lot of people have these databases.

641
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
We have access to it too, in theory.

642
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,320
You know, the pie into the demographics.

643
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,320
And they know that within any demographic,

644
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,320
you can get a certain number of votes

645
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
if you can sway them.

646
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
For instance, if you wanted to get the

647
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
the gay demographic, you might say

648
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
that you are very in favor of gay marriage.

649
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,320
If you wanted to get a demographic of elderly people,

650
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,320
you might say how in favor you were

651
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,320
of improving the social security system and so forth.

652
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,320
And you can literally get predictable

653
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,320
bumps in your popularity or bumps up or down,

654
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,320
depending on which direction you want to go.

655
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,320
It's pretty sad.

656
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Also, the whole way that our elective system works,

657
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
you've got to have the cute little sound

658
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
if you are complaining about the advertisements

659
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
and the way they sound compared to what we have here

660
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
on the internet and such.

661
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
And it's so true.

662
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
But the problem is that with our system,

663
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,320
we've got now, how can you compete

664
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,320
when they know things this precisely

665
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,320
and they know exactly what you need to change things

666
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
in a certain way.

667
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
It's kind of frustrating, isn't it?

668
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,320
To have Ron Paul go with a different sort

669
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,320
of advertising and campaign

670
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,320
would probably put him at a disadvantage.

671
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
And I was thinking about all of that

672
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,320
and about the idea that candidate

673
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
that I've liked in the past

674
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,320
have not made it so good here in New Hampshire.

675
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
We get the first shot in the first

676
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
in the nation presidential primary.

677
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,320
And I voted for a number of Ron Paul's in the past

678
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,320
that I really believed in.

679
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
They were not the mainstream candidate,

680
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,320
but they would have made

681
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,320
darn good presidents, I think.

682
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,320
And they never went very far.

683
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,320
And I thought how frustrating that was.

684
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
And it got me to thinking about Abraham Lincoln.

685
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,320
I mean, how do you think Abraham Lincoln

686
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,320
would be perceived if he would run

687
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,320
for president today?

688
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
I mean, the guy

689
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
didn't look good on TV.

690
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,320
In fact, from when I understand,

691
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
he would have been butt ugly,

692
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
especially in high-deaf.

693
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,320
Didn't someone tell me that he was gay?

694
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Well, there was some rumor about him being gay?

695
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,320
Uh, I doubt he was very good at a sound bite

696
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
and God knows what they could have

697
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
dug up from his past.

698
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
So it's kind of sad, doesn't it?

699
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
That, you know, I would really like

700
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
to think that possibly Ron Paul

701
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
could be like Abraham Lincoln.

702
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
A man that has some real sound

703
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
values down to earth,

704
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
honest, all that sort of thing.

705
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
And yet our political system may very well

706
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
make minced meat out of him.

707
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
And what a pity, do you, huh?

708
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Anymore, anyway, thanks for listening to me

709
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
and interesting in your comments on this.

710
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
And, um,

711
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
take care.

712
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Yeah, so, you know,

713
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,320
it's all a part of it.

714
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,320
Right now, Huckabee is, uh,

715
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
shooting up in all the polls, all the,

716
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,320
all the data, all the stats.

717
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,320
I think it's a setup.

718
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
I think they're just setting them up

719
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,320
and they're gonna make them look like an incredible fool.

720
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,320
You watch.

721
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Um,

722
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
I don't believe any of it.

723
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,320
I really don't.

724
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,320
I really don't believe anything

725
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,320
anyone's telling us.

726
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,320
Um, just don't believe it.

727
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
So, um,

728
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
okay, so anyway, so

729
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
we, we cannot

730
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
just elect a president.

731
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,320
We cannot just go after

732
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,320
getting our guy in there who's going to work

733
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
the system from the inside.

734
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,320
The system is big.

735
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
The system is vast.

736
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
We, we, we need some

737
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,320
civilian action to actually change this.

738
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,320
You're going back to the military industrial complex.

739
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
You know, when, uh,

740
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,320
when you think about troops coming in or going

741
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
out of Iraq,

742
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
I mean, what's the visual you have there?

743
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
The visual is, you know,

744
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,320
big C 130's transport planes,

745
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,320
uh,

746
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
landing in deserts.

747
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
Yeah, dude.

748
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
I'm sorry.

749
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,320
It's American Airlines who's been contracted

750
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
to transport our troops.

751
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
It may not be American, but it could be united.

752
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
But I think it's American Airlines.

753
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
Hundred to millions of dollars worth of contracts.

754
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
I mean, this is, this is what's happening.

755
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
Who makes that money?

756
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,320
Then I'm doing it for free.

757
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,320
They really aren't.

758
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,320
They're doing it for profit.

759
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,320
And this is what's keeping our entire system rolling.

760
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Uh, I got to tell you.

761
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
I think we should stop it.

762
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
I think we have the power to stop it.

763
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
I think it's not even that hard to stop it.

764
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
And I'm still formulating my ideas.

765
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
So this is homework for you guys.

766
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,320
But it seems to me that if we need to do,

767
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
it has to be a two-step process.

768
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,320
We have to demand that Ron Paul become president

769
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,320
because he holds the ideals of the constitution.

770
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,320
He pledged his career to the constitution.

771
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,320
And I think we need to stop the military industrial complex.

772
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
It seems like a big job, right?

773
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Well, it isn't because we still today,

774
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
we still have enough freedoms.

775
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,320
But it's dwindling by the second.

776
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,320
We still have the power to do exactly what the writers

777
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
and Los Angeles are doing for show business.

778
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Remember politics and show business kind of the same thing.

779
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
People climb the ladder the same way.

780
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,320
In fact, I'd say politics is show business for ugly people.

781
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,320
I think we can strike.

782
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,320
I think that now I need some data on this.

783
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:22,320
But obviously people who work at plants where they make weapons strike.

784
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
And there's many ways to strike.

785
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,320
You can you can call in sick.

786
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
You can there's a million different things we can do.

787
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Of course it would be much better if we basically said,

788
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,320
I'm striking until Ron Paul is president.

789
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,320
That's one way.

790
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,320
You know, so how about Burger King?

791
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,320
Pizza Hut.

792
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
You know, what if all the employees said,

793
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,320
Hey, you know what?

794
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,320
I'm sick and tired of this war.

795
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
I'm not going to support it.

796
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,320
I'm not going to work anymore until you guys get your ass out of Iraq.

797
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,320
And stop making money off of it.

798
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Stop making money off the war.

799
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,320
Now we can do this with tons of different companies.

800
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,320
Entire industries.

801
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,320
So I want you to think about it because in the next,

802
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,320
in the coming few weeks, I'm going to be coming back to this topic.

803
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,320
Because I really believe we can make this different.

804
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
This is where it all comes together, right?

805
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,320
My Abby Hoffman revisiting Abby Hoffman experience.

806
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,320
I'm a realization that show business.

807
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
And media is just like politics.

808
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:28,320
And that we cannot just think that we're going to elect a guy who represents our ideas and ideals.

809
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
And that it's all going to be okay.

810
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
We have to take action.

811
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,320
I'm, you know, this is I'm really too old for this.

812
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,320
I'm sick too.

813
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
I don't feel up to it.

814
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
And I don't work for the right people.

815
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
I work for myself.

816
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,320
But there's got to be a way that we can, we can affect this.

817
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,320
You'll see that the writers are going,

818
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,320
and the writers are having an effect on the media business.

819
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,320
We can have the same effect within weeks,

820
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,320
within weeks on the military industrial complex.

821
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
So let's think about this.

822
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
And I'd love to hear from you.

823
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,320
Obviously the common lines are wide open as well as email

824
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,320
Adam at podshow.com.

825
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Oh, yeah.

826
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,320
I don't know.

827
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
It's Amy Mack.

828
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,320
I baby.

829
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
I need some yellow.

830
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,320
I need some yellow.

831
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,320
I don't know.

832
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
I apologize to the ones that I love.

833
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,320
The left cheek and the right cheek.

834
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,320
I'm sorry that I let you get all sudden flabby.

835
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,320
Although I have to say that every squeeze in and earlier today

836
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
they are still quite nice.

837
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Oh yeah, baby.

838
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,320
It was never my intention to leave you all alone for weeks on end.

839
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
So from now on,

840
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,320
I promise I'll leave you a priority when I meet.

841
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,320
So Adam.

842
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,320
Yes.

843
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Please take me back.

844
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
Oh, Amy.

845
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Are you kidding me?

846
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,320
I go to I'll wait another year for MP3 love

847
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
for my exercise.

848
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,320
And I'm glad that you didn't actually make me do an exercise today

849
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,320
because I don't think I would have been able to handle it.

850
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
Hey, Adam. It's Chris Wayne here.

851
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,320
You're willing to do that one over the weekend.

852
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,320
Yeah.

853
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,320
About him.

854
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,320
It's Chris Wayne here.

855
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
Your illegitimate pods on from the UK.

856
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,320
You know, I must just say I haven't listened to it.

857
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
Yes, 48.

858
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
And the latest DSC, which we're all on.

859
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
Oh, the Chris Rio one, right?

860
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Daily source code, episode 694.

861
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,320
Um, head over to the iTunes Media tool.

862
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,320
And did buy a Chris Rio's voice in your photo.

863
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Excellent.

864
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,320
It's one second for that.

865
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
And yeah.

866
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
Keep going on with it.

867
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,320
Obviously shows that playing music on your show sales.

868
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
Thanks.

869
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
See you soon.

870
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
Of course it does.

871
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,320
This is the secret.

872
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,320
I got some meetings like Universal Music Group

873
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,320
and Warner Music Group.

874
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,320
They now want to talk about licensed music on podcast,

875
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,320
which is probably going to be a really short meeting.

876
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,320
Like, okay.

877
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
You know, look, pod safe or not.

878
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,320
Is that simple?

879
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
Either you put it up on the network.

880
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
Let people play it or not.

881
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,320
It's that fucking simple.

882
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,320
That's going to be the meeting.

883
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,320
But it works.

884
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
It's proof right here.

885
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,320
You've been playing a 10 second snippet.

886
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
Sales, songs.

887
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
How hard can that be?

888
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
How many Chris Rio CDs?

889
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
Do you guys still sell?

890
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
Huh?

891
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,320
Of course Matthew Snodgrass has the real answers to why.

892
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,320
Music sells when featured in the hit test.

893
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
Hi.

894
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
I'm Casey Casey.

895
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,320
Do you remember those classic hits of the 80s?

896
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
Me too.

897
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,320
But you've never heard them quite like this in the newest of the KTL series.

898
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,320
Adam Curry.

899
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Desacraced the hits of the 80s.

900
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,320
No cover on the night.

901
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
That's right.

902
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,320
You can come to hate those timeless tracks of history year in a whole new way.

903
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,320
When Adam Curry put you some worse than a blind man with a cleaver.

904
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Listen, as he performs this classic duet with Sir Evan John.

905
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,320
And it's not just the vocals Adam murders.

906
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,320
He takes that finger nails across a chalkboard styling to the tune itself.

907
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Some one call the police.

908
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:20,320
Or this holiday to the 1984 ad of two ad of Dutch.

909
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:30,320
The Zumpens telling me Brian Adams is running right back to Canada.

910
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Oh my dear Lord, call in the dark.

911
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,320
I don't know what love is.

912
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,320
Frankly, I echo Noah to make of this.

913
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,320
I think I just give up.

914
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
Check the website.

915
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Thank you.

916
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
Thank you.

917
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:55,320
KTK's now.

918
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,320
You know Patricia always says it.

919
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,320
And she's right now that I'm listening to it.

920
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,320
It sounds like I'm in pain when I'm singing absolutely.

921
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,320
Adam.

922
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Here's some Portland here.

923
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,320
Listen, you know, I don't like the fuck Adam Curry thing.

924
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,320
Fuck you Adam Curry at the end of the message.

925
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,320
I, I think it should stop.

926
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
I have enough.

927
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,320
I love you Adam Curry.

928
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,320
You know, that's it.

929
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
That's so nice.

930
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,320
I think we should start changing that I agree.

931
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,320
From now on, please end your comments with I love you Adam Curry.

932
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
And say it like you mean it damn.

933
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,320
And say I love you Adam Curry.

934
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,320
It's that time of year.

935
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,320
Time for the big Pacho Radio Christmas special.

936
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,320

00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,320

That's the day that all the fun begins.

943
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Hope to see you there.

944
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,320
Where you ask?

945
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,320
Oh, that's easy.

946
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,320
PachoRadio.com.

947
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,320
So I've been away from home for quite a while.

948
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
It's going to be at least for the rest of the week.

949
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320
I'm pretty sure.

950
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,320
I'm not feeling well.

951
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
I'm feeling a little bit lonely.

952
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,320
A little bit melancholy.

953
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,320
So, well, what can you do?

954
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
I think the best thing.

955
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:33,320
I think that I've got somewhere else to be.

956
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,320
I'll be leaving here at 6 a.m.

957
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,320
To stay in the sea, my family.

958
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,320
All my sweaters, they've been packed.

959
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,320
A bit of cold won't make me crack.

960
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,320
Once I get there, I don't know.

961
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,320
I don't care how I'm coming back.

962
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,320
Cause I would walk a thousand miles.

963
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,320
I would walk a thousand miles.

964
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:25,320
With a snow rain or better cold to be back on for Christmas.

965
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,320
I've been gone too long to say,

966
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,320
But I'm coming anyway.

967
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:40,320
I can't leave this town and get back on today.

968
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,320
Let the snow fall through the air.

969
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,320
I got eight long hours to spare.

970
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:54,320
I'll be waiting at the airport bar for three, but I don't care.

971
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:59,320
Cause I would walk a thousand miles.

972
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,320
I would walk a thousand miles.

973
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:13,320
There was a snow rain or better cold to be back on for Christmas.

974
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,320
But this long flight, don't bother me.

975
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,320
Three men and shepherds came to see.

976
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,320
The baby born this morning,

977
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:28,320
Lows away from their locality.

978
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,320
An angel singing, clear padded Lucia.

979
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,320
The Christ is coming here with no plan.

980
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,320
We're no strangers to where that's still.

981
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,320
The time and to find me.

982
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,320
You know we found me.

983
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,320
So I would walk a thousand miles.

984
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,320
I would walk a thousand miles.

985
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,320
Through the snow rain or check out lines,

986
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:05,320
A traffic change and I would walk a thousand miles.

987
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,320
I would walk a thousand miles.

988
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,320
Through the snow rain or winter storms

989
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,320
To be back on for Christmas.

990
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,320
I would walk a thousand miles.

991
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,320
I would walk a thousand miles.

992
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:33,320
Through the snow rain or better cold to be back on for Christmas.

993
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,320
Matthew Ebel recorded live in 2004.

994
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,320
I'll be home for Christmas.

995
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,320
Little melancholy there just to touch at the end.

996
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,320
Alright, so let's get all over the show.

997
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,320
We've got to stop the military industrial complex.

998
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,320
We need to elect Ron Paul.

999
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,320
It's just a minor agenda.

1000
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,320
People, I'm sure we can take care of this.

1001
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,320
TatiSourceco.com, Adam at podshow.com.

1002
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,320
I'll be back talking to you more about this later in the week.

1003
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
Bye-bye.

1004
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,320
Another podshow podcast.

1005
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Stick it in your ear.

1006
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,320
Imagine headphones without wires.

1007
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,320
Now their Sony's Bluetooth wireless headset.

1008
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,320
A rechargeable listening experience with 11 hours of music playback.

1009
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,320
So you and your music are free to move.

1010
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,320
Pick up yours at Sony.com slash headphones.

1011
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,320
Sony wireless headphones.

1012
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,320
Your music on plug.
