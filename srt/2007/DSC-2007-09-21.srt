So I got him all the time, and all the time

73
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
And all the time, and all the time, and all the time

74
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,240
And all the time, so I got him all the time

75
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
To everywhere that I was at there

76
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Which has something good about the industry

77
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
He's been getting a breeds.

78
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
That's me, alternately

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Not yet, not yet.

80
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Well, it was at six o'clock. So it is the sun has gone down over the yard arm. I've got a nice little

81
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,240
little glass of vino here to share the medium music footballer Friday with you because as you

82
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,240
mind of red on curried.com. I pre-announced that today's show. I got to talk some red pill

83
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,240
blue pill stuff. I had an interesting red pill experience and red pill moment myself this past

84
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,240
week while I was in staying over in the city. So we'll we'll get to that. Speaking of onion

85
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,240
mobile phone, by the way, lots of people now picking up the iPod touch. And I have a theory

86
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,240
about the iPod touch that I'd like to share with you after we listen to some of the feedback.

87
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Hey Adam, our green seeding hand today is September 19th, if you play this comment immediately

88
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,240
is my birthday. And from my birthday, I got me one of those iPod touches. You know, I have to tell you

89
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,240
about it. This is the music player that you need. It's like all the sex of the iPod

90
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,240
and none of the commitments. So you don't have to get one of those AT&T accounts, but you

91
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,240
know, fun and Wi-Fi everywhere. And I can not do it with a fiery browsing and do my

92
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,240
little pink thing and check out the web page is. And it's a great music player. And the videos

93
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,240
look awesome. I mean, it's significant more screen mail estate than a video iPod.

94
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,240
So, you know, how are we? Let me in.

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Let me in. I actually have a show that everybody is port city PD and widescreen. And it's

96
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,240
just rocks, man. It's a great job on the show, but it's a great thing to just show off.

97
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,240
It is called a widescreen. I agree. I agree. Well, first of all, Howard congratulations

98
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,240
dude, happy birthday. So, you know, and look at this iPod touch. And I was the first one to

99
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,240
say, you know, I would be perfectly happy with this with the iPhone without the phone capability.

100
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,240
And so you'd think that the iPod touch is really the iPhone without the phone, but it's

101
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,240
not. I'm a little suspicious of this device quite honestly, because it doesn't feel like

102
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,240
a complete Apple package the way you'd expect and to put something together. So many

103
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,240
little things were dropped. So many things that you'd expect to be in there, you know,

104
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,240
just from reading the reviews. And I have not purchased one purposely, because actually I've

105
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,240
kind of fallen back in love with the N800 because it can do so much. It's almost

106
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,240
overkill. And it's kind of industrial feeling and clunky. But, you know, the idea that you have

107
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,240
a calendar on your iPod touch, but you can't enter in the calendar. Oh, that's just ludicrous.

108
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,240
You know, no camera, the email app is out yet you have Wi-Fi. I mean, it's like, why

109
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,240
why is it so crippled? And I have a theory about this, I do.

110
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,240
I'm going to add on this mark in Los Angeles. Hey, I just wanted to give you a little

111
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:11,240
feedback on stick to explore the iTunes and the iPod touch. I was fortunate to pick one

112
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:19,240
up, I think it was Thursday. And Neil is to say, it is awesome, although missing podcasting

113
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:26,240
is really a big mistake, I think. And I'm wondering if there's some legality to it.

114
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,240
The reason why I say that is that the iPod touch has such a cool way of buying songs

115
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,240
on the iTunes music store. I mean, it is already bought. I've bought it. I heard

116
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
it buying anything. It was just so easy. It was like, wow, cool, new CD. Cool.

117
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,240
I want it. And that's on the go pushing that button. And, you know, pushing it. And

118
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,240
buy is just amazing. Well, of course, they made that really good and really easy.

119
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
They want you to feel good about buying.

120
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,240
A little device. And the reason why I'm leaving this comment is, I'm wondering what

121
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,240
you think on the legality of it. I wonder if there's something about

122
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,240
podcasting, not being on in the cloud, you might say, on a small device that has

123
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:18,240
some legal issues. And that's scholar. And if I need it, but there's just something

124
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,240
that makes me think, you know, there might be some issues there about the content

125
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,240
and who owns it, how it's delivered and that stuff.

126
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Your thoughts if you have some that you can share. And always appreciate your

127
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,240
shows. And whatever you get them out, that's why with us.

128
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Thank you.

129
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Yeah. All right. Like not getting them out for the past two days.

130
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,240
Well, I don't think there's anything with legality there. I think this is Apple's business model

131
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,240
is clear, you know, and they need people to be buying these devices to buy stuff.

132
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,240
They've got the end-end experience. It made it even nicer with purchasing.

133
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,240
And there's really nothing to purchase with the podcast, you know, at least not

134
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,240
as far as I know from the Apple iTunes store.

135
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Yeah. So it's all those little things that are left out.

136
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,240
You know, of course, you would expect you be able to access podcasts wirelessly.

137
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,240
Wouldn't it be nice? Wouldn't it be nice? Well, got to get back to the music.

138
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Here's what I think. Remember when all those rumors came out that the screen sucked

139
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,240
and it was, you know, there's a lot of reports, even though you're quite happy with

140
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,240
the video quality, a lot of reports that the, and I've seen side by side comparisons

141
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,240
that the quality of the, the screen brightness and just the quality in general is better

142
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,240
on the iPhone versus the iPod Touch.

143
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Remember when those reports came out that the screen wasn't going to be all that great

144
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,240
and the battery life was really short. Well, now I'm seeing reports that the battery life

145
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,240
of the iPod Touch is leaves a little bit to be desired there.

146
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,240
It's a little left to be desired.

147
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Do you think it's possible that they made a first run of iPhones?

148
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,240
And they really just sucked.

149
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,240
And, you know, like the screen was okay, but not fantastic and it was going to be huge

150
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,240
scrutiny and criticism and the battery was okay, but not fantastic.

151
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,240
And do you think it's possible that they took that first run of iPhones and said, you know,

152
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,240
why would we just to repackage these in a, in a, in a smaller case, which, by the way,

153
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,240
does not include a camera? Maybe the original one wasn't supposed to include a camera.

154
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,240
It just feels to me like this iPod Touch is a mashup of stuff that was, you know,

155
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,240
kind of put together last moment, not really in the Apple type thought of way.

156
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,240
You know what I mean? It just feels like that.

157
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,240
And maybe that's why I don't want it because I'm willing to deal with all the crap that you

158
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,240
have to go through with using lots of Apple devices.

159
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,240
You know, there's just stuff that seems so logical that don't put in.

160
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,240
But now it seems like it's just not even logic to the stuff they did put in there.

161
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
So I don't know. I'm glad you guys are happy with it.

162
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,240
I think I'm going to stick with the, with the 800 mainly because, well, actually two devices.

163
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Now, of course, battery life.

164
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
It's all about the battery life from me. I'm sorry.

165
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
It's just, it's just where it's out.

166
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,240
If I could buy an extra battery for the iPhone, it would be a different story.

167
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,240
But man, I mean, I do these 12 hour days.

168
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,240
And I just can't have a phone that crap's out after six, you know, six,

169
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
seven, eight hours or whatever.

170
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm heavy user of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and all this stuff.

171
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:31,240
So, I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion that some, by the way,

172
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
I'm a home all alone.

173
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,240
The girls are off jet setting to some award shows.

174
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Some glamorous award show.

175
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
And you can hear the dog barking in the background.

176
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Probably saying, hey, nice you're doing a show.

177
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
But where's my damn food, boy?

178
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Hey, Adam, zero from North Carolina here.

179
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,240
Seems like references to things on your show are starting to pop up

180
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,240
everywhere around the external last couple days.

181
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,240
I was split in by the other night with my wife, went by the Emmys on TV

182
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,240
and Jersey Boys sang, trippy to the sopranos.

183
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Over here at our realtors conference in the mountains of North Carolina.

184
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,240
John C. before that, given a keynote speech, you're everywhere, man.

185
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
I just want to let you know you're going to open them a wall.

186
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,240
It's a thing that wouldn't know the live note.

187
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
You're a show.

188
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
And look, what is here anymore often?

189
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
All right.

190
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
And I don't know where you live in North Carolina.

191
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,240
But poor city PD is produced in Guess what?

192
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Poor city.

193
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
Wilmington, North Carolina.

194
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Yes, we're everywhere.

195
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,240
And it is a football Friday bringing you the medium music addition.

196
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Fire apes are back.

197
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
They've got a brand new one that just put up on the podcast music network.

198
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,240
You know I love the fire apes.

199
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
So here's their latest for a day.

200
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,240
And I should try to let you know in wonder why.

201
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,240
And I do feel for you.

202
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,240
But I can't reach you for my view.

203
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,240
But I love you for a day.

204
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,240
Well I love you for a day.

205
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,240
That I want I want forget.

206
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Can't let go, no not yet.

207
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Sit too, wait.

208
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
She's rocking, babe.

209
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Who's the saying?

210
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Who's the plan?

211
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,240
And I love you for a day.

212
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:37,240
What I love about now too, for a day

213
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,240
She knew I so much you did,

214
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,240
And I know I'm still living,

215
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,240
I can't remember what it meant

216
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,240
She took my hand, my soul was bent,

217
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,240
And but I loved you for a day

218
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:14,240
And I'm saving it all for you

219
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Yeah, I'm saving it all for you

220
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:54,240
And I love you for a day

221
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,240
And I'm saving it all for a day

222
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,240
She always wondered what I thought

223
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,240
I never knew because I was lost

224
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,240
She said I don't know why she ran

225
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Yes, I do, I understand

226
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,240
And I love you for a day

227
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:35,240
And I'm saving it all for me

228
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:43,240
Yeah, I'm saving it all

229
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Fire apes, straight from the pots,

230
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
I'm using that work to your ear buds

231
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,240
For a day here on the chat chat

232
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
And red pill moment coming up,

233
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
As I said, but of course,

234
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
What is it, food bar Friday without?

235
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,240
Oh, I'm casting with an inquiry

236
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Not a fucking item,

237
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
I'm trying to be stumps,

238
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,240
Because he used the entire so young

239
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
I need some help

240
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Yeah, this is, it does number 88

241
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,240
And this is in drone, number one

242
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,240
As I'd preface, I'm a little tired, young

243
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
I think I'm already over one here

244
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Number two

245
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:37,240
And this week's final one, number three

246
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Okay, I know that one

247
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,240
Let's see if it appears to everybody once in a world of war

248
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,240
She's, what's the second one?

249
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Ah, it's on the tip of my tongue

250
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Don't you hate it when I happen?

251
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,240
And times happened to each other, the answers

252
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,240
This is from 1988

253
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Oh,

254
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
I would not have known this one

255
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
I was tough, young

256
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
Good to hear this jam again, though

257
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Johnny Campan, just got paid as answer number one

258
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,240
And this is answer number two

259
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,240
Oh, it's, uh, different, different, different, different, different

260
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
Laura Branagus, love a boy

261
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Oh, boy, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

262
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
I don't know, I thought you could

263
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,240
But a place with mine, I won't do so, but I won't be your lover

264
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,240
Love a boy, love a, love a, love a

265
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Millioschines answer number two

266
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
And only one left, and that's this one, I've got one

267
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Pretty easy

268
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Song from 1985

269
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:31,240
And answer number three in this week's hit test

270
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Cheers for fears, and everybody wants to rule the world from 1985

271
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Alrighty, well, thank you for playing again Adam, I hope you had them all

272
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,240
No, I think if you had the last one at least

273
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,240
Last week, I'll be back for hit test number 89

274
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,240
And of course, as always, the answers to this hit test

275
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,240
And also the links to iTunes, so you can buy these tracks

276
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,240
Can be found at hittest.pasho.com

277
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,240
And that's also the place to dig the show

278
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Alrighty, thank you for listening

279
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Until next week, until then, take care, and bye-bye

280
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,240
And after every single hit test, there's so much, such a wall of a sound that comes through the headphones

281
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,240
It feels like I just had sex, although not very satisfying sex this week

282
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Damn, that was hard, y'all, and I don't mean it that way, I'm just saying it was difficult

283
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,240
Crap, and I knew, I knew, I knew Billy Oceans' lover boy

284
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,240
And then I confused it with Laura Branding and ah, suck, suck, suck, suck

285
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Oh, yes

286
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Alright, let me see what do we have here

287
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,240
We have some feedback on mainstream media deception, always good for Friday

288
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,240
This is Mimi and I'm catching up on my summer daily source codes

289
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,240
And I just listened to your episode number 637

290
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,240
In 19th and 10th you were behind

291
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Fireed up in this episode that you talked about the deception of television

292
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,240
The fabrication of facts and reality

293
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:15,240
We just finished our summer podcast Big Brother Lova on the US's Big Brother 8

294
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,240
And boy, I'll tell you there sure was a division in the audience

295
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,240
I think it was pretty evident this season that the fix was in and that CBS

296
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,240
Went to great lengths to try to deceive the audience

297
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,240
So I was happy to hear your episode because I'm exhausted from this number

298
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Yeah, listen Mimi, Mimi, Mimi, Mimi

299
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,240
It is not all of a sudden that the fix is in

300
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,240
The fix has been in from day one on that show, please

301
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,240
You know, you really need to take this NTV experiment

302
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
And just knowing how television production works

303
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,240
Do you notice by the way these people who are in this house for like 90 days

304
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Their hair is always neatly trimmed and gets cut

305
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
I mean, how do you think that happens?

306
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
Is that like magic?

307
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Or do you think that producers come in

308
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,240
That's when they roam around the house and they set stuff up

309
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,240
And they tell people things and they get them excited and angry and emotional

310
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Believe me, it's all a part of it

311
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,240
So you don't even have to ask me to think about it

312
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,240
Of course it's fixed and I have to say the difference between the US version of Big Brother

313
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,240
And the UK version is like night and day

314
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,240
It's completely different completely different set up format

315
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,240
Right down to people having their own bedrooms

316
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,240
Or at least their multiple bedrooms instead of one big bedroom

317
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
Where everybody has to sleep as is the case here

318
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,240
The UK big brother house, so yeah all that reality stuff

319
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,240
All of it is all set up, it's all faked

320
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,240
Not all of it, but people go back and retake stuff

321
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,240
It's the way the medium works

322
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,240
So you might as well stop thinking that any of that is real

323
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
Or correct, it's just not

324
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,240
But it's entertaining, no doubt about it

325
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,240
Let's see what we're talking about it

326
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Lots of responses to my posting on korea.com about my recent TSA experience

327
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Some good, some not so good

328
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,240
Hey Adam, it's Marathon Jesse in New Hampshire USA calling

329
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,240
You know, you come across pretty arrogant on this airline security stuff

330
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,240
I know it's inconvenient for all of us but you'll remember

331
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,240
They blew up a couple buildings here and if it means that we have to carry our

332
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Let's say in 3-ounce bottles, by the way, that's been made very clear

333
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,240
That it's 3-ounce bottles and so be it

334
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,240
You know, take your pills while it's not going to have to move on

335
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Some wine and bottles

336
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
All right, so a couple interesting things about this comment

337
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,240
First of all, notice that he says something very interesting about the buildings

338
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Pretty arrogant on this airline business

339
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,240
I know it's inconvenient for all of us but you'll remember

340
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
They blew up a couple buildings

341
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Yeah, they sure did blow up a couple buildings

342
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Uh, because I got to tell you, I'm very skeptical about

343
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Aircraft because, you know, the official story is not that

344
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Buildings were blown up or imploded for that manner

345
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Uh, but that airplanes brought it down

346
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,240
So interesting that you're already thinking in a different way

347
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,240
I think there is a little bit of red pill in you trying to slip through

348
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Even though you're clearly sucking on the teeth of the blue pill mothership

349
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,240
And what's the this is three ounces shit?

350
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Of course it clearly states three ounces

351
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,240
How many milliliters is that?

352
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,240
Because my bottles are all labeled in milliliters

353
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,240
That's probably why they took away all my stuff

354
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,240
And the buildings that were blown up, as you say, that didn't happen

355
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Because of dangerous liquids being mixed together

356
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
And how much do you need?

357
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Can you do it with three milliliters?

358
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Can you create enough bad stuff?

359
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
Or is that the cutoff point?

360
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
It's bull crap, it really is

361
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
It's just complete horseshit

362
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
I can do more damage with my lighter

363
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
Which I'm not allowed to take along with me

364
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
I could bring a blow torch

365
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
In fact, I'll buy one of those blow torch lighters

366
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
And I'll prove to you that I can get that through security

367
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
You just can't sell it to me

368
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
You can't sell to me

369
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,240
That that is not dangerous and can be carried aboard

370
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
I gotta understand if both were forbidden

371
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
But it's not the case

372
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
Because I have to say

373
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,240
After this latest piece of information that I have processed

374
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,240
Which I'll tell you about in a second

375
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,240
I'm seeing that all of these things are little pieces on a really big chessboard

376
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,240
I'm not a conspiracy theory type guy

377
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,240
I really even though everything in my human body wants me to be

378
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,240
I'm just not

379
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
I just think logical about stuff

380
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Until I saw that there's a much, much, much bigger

381
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
Game at play here

382
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Okay, Adam Duke in Portland, Oregon

383
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,240
Your airline ramp rat up here in the beautiful north west

384
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Hey, listen to you rant about your friend and mine

385
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,240
The TSA on 17th show

386
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
I gotta agree with you

387
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,240
It is the biggest government moon doggle in history

388
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Of course, I can't tell you why they do the things they do

389
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,240
Because the TSA has their own version of no damn announcements that were found by

390
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
But to help ease your travel through the state

391
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,240
The standards are pretty simple and they should be fairly uniform

392
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,240
No more than three ounces of anything with gel or pasty

393
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,240
They get pretty particular about the three ounce limit

394
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
No more and no less if it's 3.2 you're host

395
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,240
And just keep everything here in a one quart plastic bag

396
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
No bigger than one quart

397
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
You can have multiple one quart bags

398
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
But it can't be bigger than a quart

399
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
So anyway, they're those tips in mind

400
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,240
And hopefully they will keep you sailing smoothly through those screen

401
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
Checkpoints in the states here

402
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Bye-bye and tailwinds my friend

403
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
Yeah, I'll tailwinds my buddy

404
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Yeah, so you can have multiple bags

405
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
Oh, go away

406
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,240
You can have multiple bags

407
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
One quart bags

408
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
How many milliliters is the quart

409
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
So tough

410
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
I need a fucking scientific calculator

411
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Okay, so you didn't get a show for me when they are Thursday

412
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,240
When's that was in the city really early?

413
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
I had a long day and I stayed overnight

414
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,240
To get an early start for an 8 a.m meeting on the Thursday

415
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Which was great by the way

416
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
With the good buddy of mine, Erica works at the BBC

417
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
It's a Dutch kid

418
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
I used to work at Microsoft and now he works at the BBC

419
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,240
And it's actually responsible for the eye player

420
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
And so people who are outside demonstrating

421
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Saying that this thing is horrible is not cross-platform

422
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,240
And it's the beast

423
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
The beast from Microsoft

424
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
Owns BBC's ass and all this stuff

425
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
That was against him

426
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
And I was chuckling about it

427
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Kind of like oh man, you got yourself into some crap

428
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,240
Now I can't tell you everything we discussed

429
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,240
But I think your prayers will be answered in that regard

430
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
So they are doing some new stuff

431
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
But anyway, that's not the point

432
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
Wednesday nights I stayed at the hotel

433
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
I got an email from podcast junky

434
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Real name Alex

435
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
And he sent me a link

436
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
To

437
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Something called the zeitgeist movie

438
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,240
And you can find that at zeitgeist movie.com

439
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,240
And this will be one of the few links in today's show notes

440
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Because it is of utmost importance

441
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
That you take a look at this movie

442
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
It's almost two hours long

443
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,240
And it's documentary style

444
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,240
And it's really, it's a beautiful work of art

445
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
Because as far as I can tell

446
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,240
This has been composed of many different videos

447
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,240
That I've seen surrounding many different topics

448
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,240
Which also includes 9-11

449
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
And the towers and implosion

450
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
They're not implosion, they're controlled demolition

451
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
But it's really not about that

452
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,240
It's about something that I like very much

453
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Following the money

454
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Not just as it relates to 9-11

455
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
Not just as it relates to the United States of America

456
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Although that is a big focus of this movie

457
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,240
But just in general

458
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,240
How, and this is probably one of the best lines in the movie

459
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
Which of course is a well known quote

460
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Absolute power corrupts absolutely

461
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,240
And I think the red pill that started to slowly transcend

462
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,240
It's way down my throat

463
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,240
It was one of realizing that there are just a bunch of rich people

464
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,240
And I mean not rich like you and I can even imagine

465
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,240
I'm rich but not even like I can imagine how rich

466
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,240
And these people don't really even conspire together

467
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,240
So it's not a conspiracy

468
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,240
It is just the way the world has always worked

469
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Think about your history

470
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,240
Who has always controlled the masses

471
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,240
It's always been the people with all the money

472
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,240
And I mean all the money

473
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,240
So I hate it when I get interrupted by

474
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,240
Let me just just kill Skype for a second

475
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,240
Sickened tired of people skyping me while I'm getting into it here

476
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,240
So the movie, which you can find at

ZiteGuysMovie.com

482
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,240
It's really a mashup of a whole bunch of stuff that's already been out there

483
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
But it is so nicely done

484
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
I should have been sleeping

485
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
Because I was dead tired

486
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,240
I watched this thing until I won 30 in the morning

487
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
And then of course I could barely sleep

488
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
Because I'm just saying myself

489
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
Oh of course it makes so much sense

490
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,240
It really, oh it's starting to dawn on me

491
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
I get it

492
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
I understand

493
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,240
So let me see if I can add a little bit of spin myself onto this

494
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
So this movie actually starts off

495
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Talking about religion

496
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,240
And how all religions or many religions are very very similar

497
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,240
Particularly when it comes to the story of Jesus

498
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,240
And the Mach of Conception

499
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
And the 12 Disciples and all of this

500
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,240
And they relate that to some common themes

501
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,240
In particular astrology

502
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,240
But I believe that they put that in there to show that

503
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,240
That really the masses have always been controlled

504
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,240
By people who have some kind of controlling mechanism

505
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,240
And really before money

506
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Religion was a great way to control the masses

507
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
And I don't want to debate about religion

508
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Because if you want to believe in anything you want to believe in

509
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
That is fine with me

510
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,240
And I don't give a shit as long as you're happy with it

511
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,240
And I don't believe religion is that effective anymore

512
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
At least not in the Western world

513
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,240
It's not that effective in motivating people to do things

514
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
We're clearly seeing

515
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,240
Islam being misused

516
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
To control people to do things

517
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
And their thoughts

518
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,240
For better or for worse

519
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
It's controlling factor there

520
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,240
And then it quickly moves on to the money game

521
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,240
And all of these facts and pieces of knowledge

522
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
That I've read about

523
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,240
And even beautiful pieces of video

524
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,240
It's really chock-full of mainstream media video

525
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,240
So of course this could never make it into

526
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,240
With theatrical release or television release

527
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Because you could never clear all the individual pieces of this movie

528
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
That's why I guess this is just

529
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,240
Whoever did this deserves a fucking medal as far as I'm concerned

530
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,240
I do want to play a couple pieces from it

531
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Because the audio will suffice

532
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
And they also do a lot with text

533
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,240
And it's basically voice over video, some animation

534
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
And lots of quotes

535
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Sometimes it just appears on the screen

536
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
So I'll actually read those

537
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
So for today's football

538
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,240
I just want to give you a little

539
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,240
A little taste of one of the really big games

540
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Again

541
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
Absolute power corrupts absolutely

542
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
If you have the money you can control all the strings

543
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,240
If you control the flow of money

544
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Who controls money?

545
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,240
Where does money come from?

546
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
What are the origins of money?

547
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,240
These are the questions that are in many ways answered

548
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
And of course I've done no fact checking on this

549
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,240
But a lot of it sounds pretty much right to what I recall

550
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,240
Now that my brains are starting to fire up a little bit

551
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,240
The first thing really is how the

552
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,240
And this is really going to go back to where

553
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,240
I think the start of where we're at today

554
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
As historically

555
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,240
People with money have just always been able to control

556
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
And wanted to control

557
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
And I have to say that

558
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,240
People with who are rich

559
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,240
I'm not talking about the people in question

560
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,240
They're really really really really big

561
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,240
Fucking filthy rich people

562
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,240
And why would you even call it filthy

563
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
But still

564
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
Rich people are a lot of times

565
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,240
I just ask holes

566
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,240
And those two seem to go hand in hand

567
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
I've noticed that

568
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,240
And maybe I'm an asshole in many regards

569
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
It's quite possible

570
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
I think money does change some things

571
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
But it's not like money

572
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
Like you get some money in your hand

573
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
And your brain turns to something else

574
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,240
One thing is people always want to get your money

575
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
But when you're in the money making business

576
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
And tons of it for yourself

577
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,240
People can get pretty ruthless and forget things

578
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
You can have someone killed today for 1500 bucks

579
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
Maybe even less

580
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,240
People are willing to do a lot for money

581
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
I think we all agree on that

582
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,240
So let's just look at how money started in the United States

583
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,240
And it's very current all of this

584
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,240
Particularly with the federal reserve

585
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,240
Just lowering the interest rate

586
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
Now we take it for granted

587
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
Yeah the Fed lower the interest rate

588
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,240
Great, who the fuck is the Fed?

589
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,240
Well the Fed is part of the central banking system

590
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
And the central banking system has members

591
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,240
And these members are banks

592
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
And bankers

593
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
And they control the money

594
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Let's just listen to a piece of this fine documentary

595
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,240
This is actually from part 3 title

596
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,240
Don't mind the men behind the curtain

597
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,240
I think you'll enjoy this in audio

598
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:55,240
So it says here there's something behind the world

599
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,240
As governed by a very different personages

600
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,240
From what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes

601
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,240
The real truth of the matter is that a financial element

602
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
In the large centers has owned the government

603
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,240
Since the days of Andrew Jackson says

604
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,240
Franklin Delano Roosevelt

605
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
1775

606
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,240
The American Revolutionary War began

607
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
As the American colonies sought to detach from England

608
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
And its oppressive monarchy

609
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,240
Though many reasons are cited for the revolution

610
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,240
One in particular sticks out as the prime cause

611
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
That came George III of England

612
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,240
Outlawed the interest-free

613
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
Independent currency

614
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,240
The colonies were producing and using themselves

615
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
In turn, forcing me

616
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,240
Okay, so I just wanted to pay attention to what's being said there

617
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,240
That King George Outlawed the interest-free money

618
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,240
That was being used in the new world at the time

619
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,240
And he wanted to use money from England

620
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
Which was not interest-free

621
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,240
Which means you have to pay for it

622
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
Them to borrow money

623
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,240
From the central bank of England at interest

624
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Immediately putting the colonies into debt

625
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,240
And as Benjamin Franklin later wrote

626
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,240
The refusal of King George III to allow the colonies to operate

627
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,240
An honest money system which freed the ordinary man

628
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,240
From the clutches of the money manipulators

629
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,240
Was probably the prime cause of the revolution

630
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,240
In 1783 America won its independence from England

631
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,240
However, its battle against the central bank concept

632
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,240
And the corrupt greed-filled man associated with it had just begun

633
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
So what is a central bank?

634
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,240
Here you go pay attention

635
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,240
A central bank is an institution that produces the currency of an entire nation

636
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Based on a historical precedent

637
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Two specific powers are inherent in central banking practice

638
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,240
The control of interest rates

639
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,240
And the control of the money supply or inflation

640
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,240
The central bank does not simply supply a government's economy with money

641
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,240
It loans it to them and interest

642
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Then through the use of increasing and decreasing the supply of money

643
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,240
The central bank regulates the value of the currency being issued

644
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,240
It is critical to understand that the entire structure of this system

645
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,240
Can only produce one thing in the long run debt debt

646
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,240
Okay, so you understand how that works

647
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,240
And this is a simplified version without a doubt

648
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,240
But the money comes from the central bank, from the federal reserve

649
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
And it's loaned to the country

650
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
So it has to be paid back

651
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,240
So when do you think we need a lot of money?

652
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,240
When do we need billions and billions of dollars

653
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,240
That creates a nice percentage of interest

654
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,240
Well, turns out when you go to war, it's pretty damn costly

655
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
So someone, this is my follow the money

656
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,240
Someone benefits from that debt that is incurred

657
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,240
And that has to be paid back

658
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
Central banking system, there you go

659
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,240
For every single dollar produced by the central bank is loaned at interest

660
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,240
That means every single dollar produced is actually the dollar plus a certain percent of debt

661
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
Based on that dollar

662
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,240
And since the central bank has the monopoly of the production of the currency for the entire country

663
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:12,240
And they loan each dollar out with immediate debt attached to it

664
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Where does the money to pay for the debt come from?

665
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
It can only come from the central bank again

666
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,240
Which means the central bank has to perpetually increase its money supply

667
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,240
To temporarily cover the outstanding debt created

668
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,240
Which in turn, since that new money is loaned out at interest as well

669
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
Creates even more debt

670
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,240
The end result of this system without fail is slavery

671
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,240
For it is impossible for the government and thus the public

672
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,240
To ever come out of the self-generating debt

673
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,240
So they go pretty deep into the slavery thing

674
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Which in a way, if you don't believe in income taxes

675
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
That's one thing

676
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,240
But if you pay income tax, they calculate it and say

677
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Well, you're probably working four months out of every year for your income taxes

678
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
You're working for the man

679
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,240
And that makes sense about 30 percent

680
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,240
So that would be four months out of the 12

681
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
Am I saying that right?

682
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,240
Yeah, I think I am

683
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Working for the man

684
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,240
I'm going to shuttle ahead here for a second

685
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,240
Into about one hour and 40 minutes in this thing

686
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
Where I want to pull another quote

687
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
I mean, they go really far in this

688
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:27,240
They trace the federal reserve system back to a gentleman named Prescott Bush

689
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
Yeah

690
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,240
Guess what?

691
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,240
Turns out he's George W's granddaddy

692
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,240
Pretty interesting stuff

693
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,240
And where he got his money from is a whole story altogether

694
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,240
So they do something and this is interesting because, you know, just like we're joking about red pill blue pill

695
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Which of course came from the matrix

696
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:51,240
There's been lots, lots and lots of great pieces of art in media and particularly film

697
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,240
That have produced warning signs about about what's going on

698
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,240
And this is something I harp on all the time is that, you know, today's media

699
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,240
You know, we're still talking with all due respect

700
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,240
Madeline McCain, yes, terrible story, what a tragedy

701
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,240
But it's not, it's not the most important news in the frickin' world, okay?

702
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,240
It's just not, there's much bigger things going on

703
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Why are we obsessed with it?

704
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Well, we've been trained in condition to be obsessed with it

705
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,240
We are completely fucking hypnotized by television

706
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,240
So of course, they go into a beautiful piece of

707
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,240
Brainwashed AmeriFox

708
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Your home is it's not working

709
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
He's so shit

710
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,240
Here's a beautiful piece from the film Network, which is one of my favorite movies

711
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Let me see if it'll actually work here

712
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:41,240
When Howard Beal gives just a fantastic rant about how we are enslaved to our televisions

713
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
Which is really important to consider my friends

714
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Because that's what mainstream media is doing to us right now

715
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
It is keeping us away from the real issues

716
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
It is keeping us from thinking for ourselves

717
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,240
Alcohol and every kind of entertainment

718
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,240
To keep the human mind entertained

719
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,240
So that you don't get in the way of important people

720
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,240
By doing too much thinking

721
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,240
You have better wake up and understand that there are people who are guiding your life

722
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
And you don't even know it

723
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,240
We're in a lot of trouble

724
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Because you people

725
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,240
And 62 million other Americans are listening to me right now

726
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,240
Because less than 3% of you people rebook

727
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,240
Because less than 15% of you re-newspapers

728
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
Because the only truth you know

729
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
Is what you get over this too

730
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Right now

731
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
There is a whole

732
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,240
An entire generation that never knew anything that didn't come out of this too

733
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
This too is the gospel

734
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
The ultimate revelation

735
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,240
This too can make or break presidents

736
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
Poets

737
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Prime ministers

738
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
This too is the most awesome

739
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,240
God damn boss

740
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,240
And the whole God as well

741
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,240
And well, he's not even older than as the wrong people

742
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,240
And when the largest company in the world

743
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,240
Controls the most awesome God damn

744
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
Propaganda boss

745
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,240
And the whole God as well

746
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,240
Who knows what

747
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
Shit

748
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
Well, we've been on the true thousand network

749
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
So you're listening to me

750
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
Listen to me

751
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Television is not the truth

752
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,240
Television is a god damn amusement park

753
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,240
Television is a circus a carnival

754
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,240
A traveling troupe of acrobat story

755
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
Tell us dance and sing as jugglers

756
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,240
Side show freaks lie, damners and football players

757
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,240
We're in the border killing business

758
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,240
But you people sit there day after day night after night

759
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,240
All ages colour screams

760
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,240
We're all you know

761
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,240
You're forgetting to believe the illusions we're spinning here

762
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
You're forgetting to think that the tube is reality

763
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
And that your own lives are unreal

764
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,240
You do whatever the tube tells you

765
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
Do dress like the tube you eat like the tube

766
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,240
You raise your children like the tube

767
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,240
You even think like the tube

768
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,240
This is mass madness

769
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,240
You maniacs

770
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,240
In God's name

771
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,240
You people are the real thing

772
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,240
Where are the illusions

773
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
Oh man

774
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,240
I love that piece

775
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,240
That is a perfect monologue from network

776
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,240
Was it like 1972 or 1972 or 1973

777
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,240
Howard Biel

778
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,240
Who of course

779
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
He's really close to home

780
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,240
And gets killed in the movie

781
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,240
And when you think about it

782
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,240
Lots of people who open their mouths about stuff

783
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,240
Like this run into some

784
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,240
Pretty nasty trouble

785
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,240
And there have been some courageous people

786
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,240
Particularly some courageous journalists who are trying to uncover what is really happening

787
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,240
And really following the money

788
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,240
This is something I was not aware of

789
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,240
Apparently

790
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,240
There is something now called the North American Union

791
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,240
And this is also very topical

792
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,240
As the Canadian dollar

793
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,240
I think as of today is actually worth a little bit more than the US dollar

794
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,240
First time in my life time that I can recall that

795
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,240
So this

796
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,240
I'm not quite sure what you call it

797
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,240
Maybe the video actually gives us

798
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,240
I'll play it in a second

799
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,240
We'll tell us what you call it

800
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,240
But it's some kind of agreement or something

801
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,240
That unifies Canada with North America and Mexico

802
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
Essentially

803
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
Making it borderless

804
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,240
And making room for a single monetary unit

805
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,240
Known as the Amaro

806
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
And this is apparently really happening

807
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,240
This is just driving me insane

808
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,240
I didn't know about the Amaro

809
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,240
Which of course sounds a lot like the Euro

810
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,240
Which makes a lot of sense

811
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,240
You know the European Union

812
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,240
Pulling everything together

813
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,240
Central banks

814
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,240
Now what if we pull all the currencies of the US

815
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,240
And Canada and Mexico together

816
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,240
That could be pretty interesting

817
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,240
I think there's a blue dobs I believe

818
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,240
Is reported on the last thing

819
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,240
Behind the curtain wand is a conscious

820
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,240
Informed public capable of critical thinking

821
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,240
Which is why a continually fraudulent zeitgeist

822
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
Is output via religion

823
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,240
The mass media and the educational system

824
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,240
They seek to keep you and distracted

825
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,240
Naive bubble

826
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,240
And they are doing a damn good job of it

827
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
In 2005 an arrangement between Canada

828
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,240
Mexico and the United States was made

829
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
This arrangement unannounced to the public

830
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
Unregulated by Congress

831
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,240
Merges the United States, Mexico and Canada

832
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,240
Into one entity

833
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
Erasing all borders

834
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,240
It's called the North American Union

835
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,240
And you might want to ask yourself why you've never heard of this

836
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,240
In fact there is only one mainstream reporter

837
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,240
Who's actually heard of

838
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,240
And has had the courage to cover this issue

839
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,240
The Bush administration's open borders policy

840
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,240
And it's a decision to ignore the enforcement

841
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
Of this country's immigration laws

842
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,240
Is part of a broader agenda

843
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,240
President Bush signed a formal agreement

844
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,240
That will end the United States as we know it

845
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,240
And he took the step without approval

846
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,240
From either of the US Congress

847
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Or the people of the United States

848
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,240
It's a deal that few have even heard of

849
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,240
It's being done again by very few people

850
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,240
At the very top on behalf of the investment class

851
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,240
But the working class of people

852
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,240
A political officials across our country

853
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,240
From communities, from cities and so forth

854
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,240
They don't know anything about this

855
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,240
This isn't some trade agreement

856
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,240
It is a total removal of sovereignty from these countries

857
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,240
Which will also result in a completely new currency

858
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,240
Called the Amaro

859
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,240
A part from that

860
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,240
I think one thing people who are dollar based need to focus on is the Amaro

861
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,240
That's the one thing that nobody's talking about

862
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,240
But I think it's going to have a big impact on everybody's life

863
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,240
And Canada, the US and Mexico

864
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,240
The Amaro is a proposal currency for the North American community

865
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,240
Which is being developed right now

866
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,240
The US and Mexico to make a borderless community

867
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
Much like the EU

868
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,240
And the dollar, Canadian dollar, US dollar

869
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,240
And the Mexican pays to replace the Amaro

870
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,240
By default of this agreement

871
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,240
The American Constitution will eventually be obsolete

872
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,240
Okay

873
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,240
So there's some real reporting in there

874
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,240
But not a lot of it

875
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,240
But it really does seem to be happening

876
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,240
So in short

877
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,240
The concept and what they're trying to say

878
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,240
In this movie and this documentary

879
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,240
I guess we would call it

880
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,240
Is that people with who have all the money

881
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,240
And there's just not a lot of them

882
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
There are families, particularly

883
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,240
Usually

884
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,240
So the Rockefellers

885
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,240
The Morgan's

886
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,240
The Rothschild's

887
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,240
Maybe some royal families

888
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,240
Wouldn't surprise me if they'd been

889
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
Lodden family was one of them

890
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,240
Who fight over turf

891
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,240
And control markets with money

892
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,240
Through the central banking system

893
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,240
And to make more money

894
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,240
Well, it's good to start a war

895
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,240
Because war

896
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,240
Makes you tons of fucking money

897
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,240
If you're in the money business

898
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,240
Or if you're in the

899
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,240
Or machinery production business

900
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
Dick Cheney

901
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,240
So

902
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,240
I'm really, I gotta tell you

903
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,240
I'm really starting to see a big picture here

904
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,240
Now again, not a conspiracy

905
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,240
I have a hard time believing

906
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,240
That all these rich families

907
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,240
Are continuously conspiring to take over the world

908
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,240
Yeah, that's where it's headed

909
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,240
But I think they don't need to conspire

910
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,240
I think they can just look at the open up the financial times

911
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,240
And look at the

912
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,240
The currencies, how they're trading

913
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,240
And look at what the cost of war is

914
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
And then look at the balance sheets of the companies

915
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
That they control

916
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,240
They own

917
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,240
And all the while, of course

918
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,240
Feeding us bubble gum

919
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,240
For our brains through mainstream media

920
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,240
Which is not necessarily conspiracy

921
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,240
It can be done by helping people out

922
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,240
Helping people who produce bubble gum

923
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,240
Entertainment

924
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,240
Like a rooper in Murdoch

925
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,240
Helping

926
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
Become an American citizen

927
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,240
And have lots of ownership

928
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,240
And deregulate stuff

929
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,240
So it's not really controlling

930
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,240
That's more like

931
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,240
Yeah, motivating

932
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,240
You know, just kind of massaging the marketplace

933
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,240
And it clearly doesn't always work

934
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,240
They don't have control over me

935
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,240
You don't have control over you

936
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,240
In no way shape or form

937
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,240
Well, indirectly

938
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,240
The IRS of course is pretty powerful

939
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,240
They control a lot of people through the IRS

940
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,240
That's basically how they fuck you at the end of the day

941
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,240
But that's just money

942
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,240
You know

943
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,240
It's not entire economies

944
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,240
Which they're able to

945
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,240
To manipulate

946
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,240
So you start a war

947
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,240
How do you start a war

948
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,240
Well, you've got to have some kind of

949
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,240
Cataclysmic event

950
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,240
So we've had several

951
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,240
We've had Pearl Harbor

952
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,240
We've had 9-11

953
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,240
I think they probably tried

954
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,240
With the first World Trade Center bombing

955
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,240
And then, you know

956
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,240
Once you have some event like that

957
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
Then of course a war cabinet

958
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,240
Goes into place

959
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,240
And your freedoms are taken away

960
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,240
And stuff is shut down

961
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,240
And the power builds

962
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,240
This is exactly what Hitler did

963
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,240
With the Reichstag

964
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,240
Which is well documented

965
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,240
He orchestrated

966
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,240
The Nazis started that themselves

967
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,240
They burned down the governmental building

968
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,240
And that was all that Hitler needed

969
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,240
That in some money

970
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,240
And, you know, you need money to start a war

971
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,240
And to follow through with it

972
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,240
And you need a good enemy

973
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,240
That you can personify

974
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,240
These things

975
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,240
It's real

976
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,240
I'm, oh my gosh

977
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,240
If you cut me right now

978
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,240
I'd bleed red pill

979
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
Let me shuttle forward a little bit

980
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,240
This is here

981
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,240
Do you want to hear a really, really rich mother fucker

982
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,240
Talking about money

983
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,240
Oh, you've got to listen to this

984
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,240
Actually, I want to read one or two quotes here

985
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
Maybe I should play this whole bit

986
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,240
So what we're going to go into

987
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:29,240
Is a guy who was talking about

988
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,240
A conversation he had

989
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,240
With one of the Rockefellers

990
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,240
And the conversation is pre 9-11

991
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,240
About a year before 9-11

992
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,240
And there's some other things that are coming up right now

993
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,240
In this piece

994
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,240
And if there's something on the screen

995
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,240
I'll just read it off to you

996
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,240
There's a currency for the North American community

997
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,240
Which is being developed right now

998
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,240
Between Canada, the US, and Mexico

999
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,240
To make a borderless community

1000
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,240
Much like the EU

1001
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,240
And the dollar, Canadian dollar, US dollar

1002
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,240
And the Mexican pays so replaced by the Amaro

1003
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,240
By default of this agreement

1004
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,240
The American Constitution will eventually be obsolete

1005
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,240
You would think that a situation like this

1006
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,240
Would be on the cover of every major newspaper

1007
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,240
Yeah, that is until you realize

1008
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,240
The people who are behind this movement

1009
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,240
Are the same people behind the mainstream media

1010
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,240
And you are not told what you're not supposed to know

1011
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,240
Okay, I'm going to know what the American Union

1012
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,240
Is the same concept as the European Union

1013
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,240
The African Union and the soon-to-be Asian Union

1014
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,240
And the same people are behind all of them

1015
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,240
And when the time is right

1016
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,240
The North American Union, the European Union

1017
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,240
The African Union and the Asian Union

1018
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,240
Will be merged together

1019
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,240
Forming the final stages of a plan

1020
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,240
These men have been working on for over 60 years

1021
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,240
A one-world government

1022
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,240
We shall have world government

1023
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,240
Whether or not we like it

1024
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,240
The only question is whether world government will be achieved

1025
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,240
By conquest or by consent

1026
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,240
Paul Wallberg, Council on Foreign Relations

1027
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,240
Architect of the Federal Reserve System

1028
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Banker

1029
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,240
We are grateful to the Washington Post

1030
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,240
The New York Times, Time Magazine

1031
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,240
And other great publications

1032
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,240
whose directors have attended our meetings

1033
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,240
And respected their promises of discretion

1034
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,240
For almost 40 years

1035
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,240
It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan

1036
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,240
For the world if we had been subjected to the light

1037
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,240
Of publicity during those years

1038
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,240
But the world is more sophisticated

1039
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,240
And prepared to march toward a world government

1040
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,240
The supernatural sovereignty of an intellectual elite

1041
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,240
And the world bankers is surely preferable

1042
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,240
To the national auto-determination

1043
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Practice in past centuries

1044
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,240
David Rockefeller

1045
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,240
Council on Foreign Relations

1046
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,240
Banker

1047
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,240
One bank, one army, one center of power

1048
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,240
And if we have learned anything from history

1049
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,240
It is that power corrupts

1050
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,240
And absolute power corrupts absolutely

1051
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,240
This is Aaron Russo, a filmmaker and former politician

1052
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,240
To his left is Nicholas Rockefeller

1053
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,240
Of the infamous Rockefeller banking and business dynasty

1054
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,240
After maintaining a close friendship with Nicholas Rockefeller

1055
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
Aaron eventually ended the relationship

1056
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,240
Appalled by what he had learned about the Rockefellers and their ambitions

1057
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,240
I got a cool one day from the Terry woman I knew

1058
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,240
And she said, would you like to meet one of the Rockefellers?

1059
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,240
What did you say?

1060
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,240
I'd love to

1061
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,240
And we became friends

1062
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,240
And we began to divulge a lot of things to me

1063
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,240
So he said to me, one night he said that there's going to be an event there

1064
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,240
And how does that event?

1065
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,240
You're going to see we're going to go into Afghanistan

1066
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,240
So we run pipelines from the Caspian Sea

1067
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,240
We're going to go into Iraq

1068
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,240
To take the oil and establish a base in the Middle East

1069
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,240
And we're going to go into Venezuela

1070
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,240
And then trying to get me into Venezuela

1071
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,240
And the first two, they've accomplished Venezuela

1072
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,240
They didn't accomplish

1073
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,240
And you can see guys going into caves looking for

1074
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,240
Looking for people that they're never going to find

1075
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,240
You know, he's laughing about the fact that you have this war

1076
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,240
On terror, there's no real enemy

1077
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,240
He's talking about how

1078
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,240
By having this war on terror

1079
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,240
You can never win it because the sea is so sea eternal war

1080
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,240
And so you can always keep taking people's liberties away

1081
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,240
And I said, how do you convince people that this war is real?

1082
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,240
This is for the media.

1083
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,240
The media is convincing, right?

1084
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,240
It's real, I mean, you know, it's just that you keep talking about things

1085
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,240
You keep saying it over and over and over again

1086
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,240
And eventually people believe it

1087
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,240
You know, you created the Star Reserve in 1913 through lies

1088
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,240
You create 9-11, which is another lie

1089
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,240
Do 9-11, you then you're fighting a war on terror

1090
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,240
And that was when you go into Iraq, which was another lie

1091
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,240
And then I was going to do I ran

1092
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,240
You know, and so one thing leading to it, I'm leading to another

1093
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,240
I would say, why are you doing this for?

1094
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,240
What's the point of this thing?

1095
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,240
Yeah, well, the money in the world, yeah, but what?

1096
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,240
Yeah, all the power?

1097
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,240
I said, you know, you're hurting people, is it's not a good thing

1098
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,240
And you would say, what do you care about the people for?

1099
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,240
Take care of yourself and take care of your family

1100
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,240
And then I said, so what's the ultimate war?

1101
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,240
What are the ultimate goals here?

1102
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,240
To the ultimate goal, the ultimate goal is to get everybody in this world

1103
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,240
Chipped with the two with the RFID chip

1104
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,240
And have all money beyond those chips

1105
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,240
And everything on those chips

1106
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,240
And if anybody wants to protest what we do

1107
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,240
Or violate what we want, we just turn off the chip

1108
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,240
That was okay, my good job, okay

1109
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,240
So I don't know if you could hear all of that

1110
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,240
They actually put some of the words on the screen

1111
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,240
Where it may be a little difficult to hear

1112
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:34,240
So the ultimate goal, the ultimate goal is to put all the money

1113
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,240
On an RFID chip

1114
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,240
That's one of these chips that people are now implanting into themselves

1115
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,240
Some doing it to get into nightclubs

1116
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:48,240
That happened in Barcelona, Spain, year or two ago

1117
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,240
Some brave families are doing it

1118
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:55,240
Just, you know, was it to be able to find each other

1119
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,240
As a GPS, like a locator thing

1120
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,240
But here is, you know, of course it's second hand

1121
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,240
But I got just got to believe it's true

1122
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,240
Here's the grand strategy

1123
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,240
Everybody has all their money on a chip

1124
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,240
Which is embedded in your arm

1125
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,240
And if you act up, if you're not marching with the program

1126
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,240
We just turn off your money

1127
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,240
It's what the IRS does today

1128
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,240
But that's what they'll do

1129
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,240
To just turn off your fucking money

1130
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,240
And that's the end goal

1131
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,240
That's what it's all about

1132
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,240
So it's really just a couple families

1133
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,240
A couple guys

1134
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,240
I don't even think they're really conspiring together

1135
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,240
Sometimes they do, you know, to create an event like 9-11

1136
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,240
3,000 people is no fucking big deal to them

1137
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,240
None, whatsoever

1138
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,240
And just look through history

1139
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,240
Anyone who's ever stood up to these types of forces

1140
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,240
And these types of power

1141
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,240
Have been killed

1142
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,240
It's that simple

1143
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,240
Politicians happens all the time

1144
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,240
Just get off

1145
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,240
It's not that hard

1146
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,240
It's cheap, that's easy, expendable

1147
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,240
When if you think in today's world

1148
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,240
That doesn't happen?

1149
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,240
You got another thing coming

1150
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,240
You think Pete that there are?

1151
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,240
That can't be some people who actually think that way?

1152
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,240
Absolutely

1153
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,240
Now, here is the under estimation

1154
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,240
Now, you know what?

1155
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,240
I'm going to save that as the final thought of the week

1156
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,240
I want to take a second here

1157
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,240
Let's just relax

1158
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,240
Too much red pill flowing through the veins

1159
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,240
Stephanie Sesskin's on

1160
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,240
When we first started

1161
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,240
You were so sincere

1162
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,240
My night and armor

1163
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,240
Had nothing to fear

1164
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:44,240
You never did things that you did not feel

1165
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,240
I should've known to enough for real

1166
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,240
You said the right words

1167
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,240
We did all the right things

1168
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,240
I love make others move like one night

1169
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,240
When we may love it, may my body hold

1170
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,240
But now I see that you don't have a soul

1171
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,240
You've been jerking my trade

1172
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,240
Oh, all in my strings

1173
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,240
Oh, playin' me like someone

1174
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,240
I own land

1175
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,240
You've been jerking my trade

1176
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,240
Oh, playin' your game

1177
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,240
Oh, playin' my boy now

1178
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,240
Oh, I'm safe, dream

1179
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,240
The good news baby

1180
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,240
Is I've seen the light

1181
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,240
And here I know

1182
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,240
I'm going to be alright

1183
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,240
In some day

1184
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,240
When you two listen bold

1185
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,240
You'll wonder why

1186
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,240
You can't have it all

1187
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,240
You've been jerking my trade

1188
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,240
Oh, all in my strings

1189
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,240
Oh, playin' me like someone

1190
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,240
Oh, playin' me like someone

1191
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,240
Oh, playin' your game

1192
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,240
Oh, playin' my boy now

1193
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,240
Oh, playin' my trade

1194
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,240
I could've agreed to a good night's revenge

1195
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:11,240
Could be my sailor but it'd be my sailor but it'd be my sailor

1196
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,240
It'd get depressed to wallow in hate

1197
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,240
But guess what?

1198
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,240
Your love wasn't all that great

1199
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,240
You've been jerking my trade

1200
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,240
Oh, all in my strings

1201
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,240
Oh, playin' me like someone

1202
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,240
Oh, playin' me like somebody

1203
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,240
Oh, playin' me like someone

1204
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,240
Oh, playin' your game

1205
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,240
Oh, playin' boy now

1206
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,240
Oh, go playin' me like someone

1207
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,240
Oh, I'm safe, dream

1208
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,240
You've been jerking my trade

1209
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,240
Oh, all in my strings

1210
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,240
Oh, playin' me like someone

1211
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,240
Oh, playin' me like someone

1212
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,240
Oh, playin' me like someone

1213
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,240
No, playin' me like someone

1214
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,240
we can.

1215
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:57,980
Now we're moving all day.

1216
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:02,360
Stepping by the way in the history...

1217
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,860
Let's go to the James history.

1218
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:13,040
Yeah you give it all.

1219
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:17,080
Stephanie Saskin.

1220
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:21,400
You'll find her on the Podsive Music Network links in the show notes a daily source code.com, of course.

1221
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:28,440
So what if we learn today from this, what I think is just accidentally produced a piece of video

1222
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:36,520
that war is good. And by the way, according to this philosophy, the war in Iraq is going beautifully.

1223
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:43,160
Have you ever heard of the concept divide and conquer? You know, take like two people who

1224
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:49,160
kind of hate each other anyway, like Sunnis and Shea's and then divide them and then feed them weapons

1225
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,920
and crap and intelligence on both ends so they kill each other so you don't have to do it.

1226
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,160
Ever heard of that one? That's a pretty old trick.

1227
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:03,320
Dog does not agree with anything I'm saying. War is good. We need more war. We need an endless war.

1228
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,200
We had a war on drugs, which of course is probably a scam as well.

1229
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,520
Well, it's probably a whole bunch of people feeding new drugs to keep you stupid.

1230
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:20,680
So this is not about small conspiracies and in the grand scheme of things,

1231
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:28,600
9-11, very small conspiracy. Big thing to pull off, masterfully done, pull the wool over all of

1232
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:34,440
our eyes. I have my own thoughts about that, but it's not what I want to focus on. We have to figure

1233
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:43,480
out a way to shut up. We have to figure out a way to use this wonderful new medium that we're creating

1234
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:49,800
to get people to take the red pill. You've just got to be aware of it. We have to stop.

1235
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:54,120
Now there's two ways we can do it. You can do it by voting the right people into office

1236
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:58,200
and protecting them. They will need protection because the people who are smart and mother

1237
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:04,200
fuckers get killed. We'll have to protect them. And of course, thank God for the shot up.

1238
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,240
I'm in the middle of something important here. Thank God for the American Constitution because

1239
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,480
right there it says we have the right to bear arms, which means we can form a militia and go

1240
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:21,320
fuck those motherfuckers up. I believe the right way to do it is through the system that was

1241
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:26,760
set up and that seems to be still kind of working, but we are under utilizing it.

1242
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:33,480
We have people in the European Union, ministers, not elected officials who are determining the

1243
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:39,240
fate of what's happening in Europe. It is completely ridiculous. It's Friday.

1244
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:54,280
All right. So what has gone awry really with this plan? This global idea of just keeping

1245
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:58,600
us dumb and milking us for all we've got and taking us up to the point of being enslaved by

1246
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:02,520
having our money embedded in chips and our bodies, which can turn on and off at the flick of a

1247
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:07,480
switch just to control us. Well, we've got the internet to my friend. We've got the series of

1248
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,760
tubes. We've got communication. We're talking to each other. We've got video. We've got audio. We've got

1249
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:17,800
a voice. We've got ideas. We've got minds. We can mash it all together and that is exactly what's

1250
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:23,480
happening. So we need to figure out a way to get this word out. We need memes to spread. Red pill is a

1251
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:29,240
good one. It's a good analogy. Of course, not everyone saw the matrix. We have to keep people awake

1252
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:35,800
and we have to get the right people into positions of power, governmental power, that are clearly

1253
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:42,840
spelled out. You know, then we have to protect them. And America, we're lucky, as I said, we got guns.

1254
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:47,240
We can protect people with those. We're just going to have to. I feel it just may go that far.

1255
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,240
So I don't want to put a bummer on you. We can't drive anything. I think it's actually quite

1256
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:57,160
invigorating. I'm looking forward to figuring out how to, how to gather. We can pass the word on.

1257
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:03,800
Get people to wake up. Get them to understand what is taking place. And how even Brittany

1258
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:08,760
spears is a part of that. It's the bubble gum that we're chewing on. So we don't pay attention

1259
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:13,480
to things that are really important. Madeline, Madeline McCain, same thing. I got to tell you,

1260
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:18,280
it does not belong at the top of the news. It is not the most important thing going on in the world.

1261
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:25,240
So I wish I had a snappy slogan. Maybe we'll come up with one. I cannot wait to hear back from

1262
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:30,040
you guys. I know I've worked on a few people up. And even the people who are going to be angry and

1263
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:36,360
say that it's not true. And I'm off my rocker. It's okay. I understand. It's just a blue pill moment.

1264
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:42,920
