Come on, come on.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hi, honey.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How's it going?

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm beat.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This city just keeps getting worse.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's like I'm driving a bus full of doghermins in my ass.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's made out of dog biscuits.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry you had such a rough day honey.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Put it for a little help.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I loaded you up a bomb and downloaded the DSC675.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Alright, so you can listen to it while I fix your supper.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't feel like it.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But it's full of our Friday.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No, sweetheart.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How can you be so nice to a mole-plack me?

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Don't, it's just because I love you so much sweet.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Baby, fuck you, Adam Curry.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Silent Library

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I got it.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There was $16 million worth of airplane trapped by us.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Since the next generation radio content in my ears.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I like to think I'm smiling each of these insurance.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm justing his bedroom curry

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My pride ain't

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm getting out of the house

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm getting out of my room

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It feels like it needs to be

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It feels like it needs to be

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It feels like it needs to be

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It feels like it needs to be

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It feels like it needs to be

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It feels like it needs to be

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can do it

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
When you grow, it's okay

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not to do it

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's just so ahead and feel your man

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Here up, and do your back

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And go to be a shine

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It feels like it needs to be

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm getting out of the house

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm getting out of the house

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm getting out of the house

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It feels like it needs to be

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It feels like it needs to be

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It feels like it needs to be

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It feels like it needs to be

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm getting out of the house

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It feels like it needs to be

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It feels like it needs to be

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm getting out of the house

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And we go wrong

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Just because I'm on

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't take the time to jump a heart

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Just because I need you

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What's in there, what's up, what's in there

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Just because I'm on

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't take the time to jump a heart

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Just because I need you

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Just because I need you

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Just because I need you

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Just because I need you

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I need the time to jump a heart

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Just because I need you

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Just because I need you

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Just because I need you

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,700
What's the theater Livestzenie I'm Gonna Let her Out

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,700
Seunu's Say Yeah

73
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,000
What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:05:02,000

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm so mad, all of me, my pussy, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,040
it's me, it's me,

78
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:24,200
it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, just me, just me, and even me, I'm willing to become crazy up back then I'm willing to love more

79
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,760
Change and everything seems like it's up and down

80
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,000
With this wave and to the moon and to the moon

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,200
Everywhere you look, it seems like it's been five

82
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,800
Like to be trying to find a rainbow

83
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,000
No one's ever found, just don't you think

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,600
But it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good

85
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,200
Everything you need, five by your feet

86
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,200
The miles touch, everything I touch

87
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Once ago, before you look at my heart

88
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,200
The miles touch, you'll never let me touch

89
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
I'm fighting, I'm just so old

90
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

91
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,200
The miles, the miles, the miles

92
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,200
The miles, the miles, the miles

93
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,200
The miles, the miles, the miles

94
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,200
The miles, the miles, the miles

95
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
The miles, the miles, the miles

96
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
You want to be a finger-finger for my life

97
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
It's all things, but the little thing

98
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
I found on your feet again

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
I think you always bring it up

100
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
A week and a day

101
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
It's all flower stones

102
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
You know that I might not have to be

103
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Who's right, I'm just wrong

104
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
You got me, yeah

105
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Take over, you take it, it's in me

106
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,200
And when it goes, that's it

107
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Take over, you take it, it's in me

108
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,200
And when it goes, that's it

109
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
It's all flower stones

110
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
You know that I might not have to be

111
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Who's right, I'm just so old

112
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
A week and a day

113
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
It's all things, but the little thing

114
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
I think you always bring it up

115
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
A week and a day

116
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
It's all things, but the little thing

117
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,200
I think you always bring it up

118
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Okay, evenly endorsed by the organization

119
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,200
To the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives

120
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
If you weren't alive in the 80s

121
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
That's pretty much a good portion of it right there

122
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
That you've mastered it up

123
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
In the mix up old school style

124
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,200
From the bond from door starters

125
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,200
A fine Dutch group, a loose-knit group of

126
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Mixers, remixers and mash-ups

127
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Who've been at this for a long, long time

128
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,200
I think for the radio program very much

129
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Soul Show

130
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
And a link was sent to me by Marlaine

131
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Who said, Adam, do you remember these mixes?

132
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Boy, do I ever?

133
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
What a way to kick off the footballer Friday

134
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
I'm almost afraid actually

135
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,200
To put a link in the show notes

136
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
To this fantastic resource

137
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Because I'm afraid that

138
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
You know, their server may come crashing down

139
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Or whatever

140
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
So I've got to think about that

141
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
So there are fun veils, synths, synths

142
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Is the one who mixed that one up

143
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
It was Mixed Number 207, man

144
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
All right, everybody, how you doing?

145
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
It's a footballer Friday

146
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,200
It is not entirely a maximum music footballer Friday

147
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Because there's just too much incoming

148
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Too much inbound, too much to talk about

149
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
And I gotta hurry up today

150
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
I have a photo shoot here at the curry manner

151
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Coming up a little bit later today

152
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Between one and two, a player magazine

153
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Will be here

154
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Yeah, because I'm such a player

155
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,200
And I'm still in the, this is actually the backup bathroom

156
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
That I have on today, it is

157
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,200
It's kind of like an Indian vibe

158
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Not as an American Indian, but as an Indian from India

159
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Of course, still sporting the black egg boots

160
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
I gotta tell you, I am excited

161
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Yesterday, confirmation came through

162
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
And of course, we'll be talking about this today

163
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Confirmation came through that

164
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Republican presidential candidate

165
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Dr. Ron Paul will be appearing on this program

166
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,200
The daily source code, this coming Wednesday

167
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,200
So the way it's gonna work is

168
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
I will be speaking with him at 10 a.m.

169
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Washington time when he is still at his condo

170
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Because after I think after 11 he has to

171
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Be somewhere to vote

172
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
And he could only use his cell phone

173
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Which apparently is an iPhone

174
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Plenty of you have been sending me pictures about that

175
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,200
So that's like 3 p.m. London time

176
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,200
So actually I'm just gonna not go into London

177
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,200
On Wednesday, just stay here and get the call going

178
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
And you know, I've got at least half an hour

179
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
And had a great talk yesterday

180
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
With the communications director of the campaign

181
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
So we'll be talking about that later today

182
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Of course, some awesome music

183
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
As you can expect, Sir Jersey taught us here

184
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
We've got youngplets hit test

185
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,200
And of course your calls coming in in great volumes

186
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
I'm sorry if you're not getting on the show

187
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
It's just too much

188
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
And even I wouldn't want to listen to the show

189
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Was over an hour long

190
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Hey Adam, it's Jerry from anapolis

191
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
And at this point whatever I say regarding the whole

192
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,200
We've got issues and the freedom issues and all that

193
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Probably we're just piling on

194
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,200
But I figured I have to add my two cents for us

195
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I have the freedom to do so

196
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,200
I think it's unrealistic that change

197
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,200
I get that and I get that

198
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,200
And it's an emotional thing, emotional debate

199
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
But you've got to understand that

200
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
While you might be a world citizen

201
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
You are also a citizen of the United States

202
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,200
And you're a story

203
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Your angle is gonna have that bias

204
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
And I think that's reasonable

205
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Just as it is

206
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
You know his approach to life

207
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Probably has a bias from wherever he's from

208
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,200
So I think it's unreasonable to expect to adopt a

209
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Generic vanilla approach to all problems

210
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,200
I mean if there was a suitable solution to all problems

211
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
That was agreeable to everyone

212
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
That we'd be doing

213
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
First of all being made

214
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Because no one in terms of everyone

215
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Can agree on everything all the time

216
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
So you're gonna make somebody unhappy

217
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
And oh well

218
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
So I think you know

219
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Plus the way you said you know enjoy your freedom

220
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I think it was well understood

221
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Anybody's listening to your podcast

222
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Clearly has some freedom

223
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
You know

224
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,200
And I think the point was enjoy the freedom you have

225
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
And I think change might be in the minority

226
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
To have misinterpreted that

227
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Guns well you know

228
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I'm not a gun fan

229
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,200
On the other hand I do believe if you take away the guns

230
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Then you end up with bad guys with guns

231
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
And no good guys with guns

232
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
And that's not a good combination

233
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
I do believe that if you've got a gun

234
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,200
And it's loaded you better be prepared to kill somebody

235
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I think there are a lot of people who have guns

236
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Who don't show proper respect to the weapon

237
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
And when they end up

238
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Using it they end up with consequences they were not intending

239
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
And my feeling is if you've got a weapon

240
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
You have to understand how to use it

241
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
And understand the consequences of using it

242
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,200
And be prepared for all possible outcomes

243
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
And that includes enforcement

244
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,200
And the crimes that you may have committed

245
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
And using the weapon

246
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,200
So I think if we just enforce our laws

247
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,200
To the letter and not do this plea bargaining business

248
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
And people who use guns

249
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
And the commission of a crime

250
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Got what they deserve

251
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,200
And it would do to be at least more deterrent than we currently have

252
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
So anyway I could go on and on

253
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
That's some of my two sims for us

254
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Folder

255
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Boopill

256
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
I'll see what else I'm supposed to say

257
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Fuck you at a furry

258
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
You know

259
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
I wanted to play that for you because

260
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Essentially you know

261
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Yeah you piled on but you piled on with some sanity there

262
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200
And I've been listening to a number of comments coming in tons of email

263
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
It's really it's really quite amazing

264
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,200
How the shift in topical discussion here on the Charlie has

265
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,200
As caused quite a bit of a bit of feedback

266
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Lots of new listeners as well

267
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
People who are checking in that they've

268
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,200
What about the conversation going on so welcome everybody

269
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
For those of you who are brand new to the show

270
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Please note that it is okay at the end of your comment

271
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
In fact it's encouraged to tell me go fuck myself

272
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
And

273
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Who sent this to me?

274
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Shit

275
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
I don't know who sent this

276
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Here it is

277
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Swaring at work boost team spirit and morale according to research

278
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Here you go

279
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
You're Huda Baruch

280
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Professor Management at the University of East Anglia and graduate

281
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Stuart Jenkins studied the use of profanity in the workplace

282
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
And assess this implications for managers

283
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,200
They assess that swearing will become more common as traditional

284
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Taboo's are broken down but the key appeared to be knowing when

285
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Such language was appropriate and went to turn a blind eye

286
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Employees use swearing on a continuous basis

287
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
But not necessarily in a negative abusive manner

288
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Said Baruch who works in the University's business school in North

289
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Banning swear words and representing staff might represent strong leadership

290
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,200
But could remove key links between staff and impact on morale and motivation

291
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
How interesting is this?

292
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
I'll put a link in the show notes to this study because you definitely

293
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Have to read it and I agree

294
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
For some reason it feels really powerful

295
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Doesn't it just to be able to say that?

296
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Particularly you guys seem to really love saying it to me

297
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,200
But the quality of the content of what you're saying just before that

298
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
It's improved dramatically

299
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
I have to tell you I'm the guy that gets all this shit coming in

300
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
One other thing I realize is that

301
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,200
EI is an American actually know very little about the constitution

302
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,200
And Angela Thornton sent me this fantastic link to

303
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,200
series of videos which are on Google video and this one

304
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,200
This is homework between now and Wednesday when Ron Paul will be on on the show

305
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
It is what's it called?

306
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
It's called constitution class

307
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,200
And it's eight hours okay

308
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
So it's this is no joke

309
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
There's eight different videos eight hours in total

310
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,200
But it really takes you through the entire concept of the constitution

311
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
The Bill of Rights

312
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
What is a right?

313
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
What is a privilege?

314
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
What is property?

315
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,200
What responsibilities come with rights?

316
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Very very interesting stuff if you want to understand about the

317
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Workings of the Republic of the United States of America

318
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,200
And if you're truly involved in what's going on

319
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
I encourage you to take a look at that

320
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
I know it's it's a big assignment

321
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,200
And I'm only through our three right now

322
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Because Christ where do you find it?

323
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,200
It's not easy to find the time

324
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,200
But I think it's fundamental if if you're interested in the topic

325
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,200
If you're an American citizen you are almost obliged

326
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
You know you have to take a look at this

327
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Now if you're a citizen of the world and a citizen of music

328
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
And you love the 70s 80s 90s

329
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Shit sometimes the 60s

330
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Well young palettes your man

331
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
I'm counting casting with Adam Curry

332
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Hey Adam, are you ready to be stumps

333
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Because he used the hint

334
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Bring it on mate

335
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Hey Adam, it's time for another hit test

336
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
On this week hit test

337
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
There's number 92

338
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Okay, I'm ready

339
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
And this is intro number one

340
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Uh

341
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Uh

342
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Stand up, stand up

343
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Meet Jagger Peter Toss

344
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
She's going to walk and don't look back

345
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Yes, I'm sure of that one

346
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Bring on number 2

347
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Number 2

348
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Police

349
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Is it a little thing she does as magic?

350
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Easy this week young

351
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
I think

352
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Which is when getting them right

353
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
And number 3

354
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Please

355
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Now you're insulting my intelligence

356
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Brick ass, we never gonna give you up

357
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Don't tell me it got three stars today on

358
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
675

359
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
And time's up

360
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
And these are the answers

361
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
That's right

362
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
The answer number one from 1979

363
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Nick Jagger and Peter Toss

364
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Yes

365
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Got to running from

366
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
There is no one

367
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
No one

368
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
No one

369
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
No one

370
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
You can't

371
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
With you just

372
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Put your hand in mind

373
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,200
We're gonna leave all that troubles behind

374
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
We're gonna walk and don't look back

375
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Don't look back

376
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Nick Jagger and Peter Toss

377
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
And you got to walk and don't look back

378
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
As answer number one

379
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
And this is answer number two

380
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
From 1981

381
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
The police

382
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Thank you

383
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Thank you

384
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Here we go

385
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
You know the words

386
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Sing along now

387
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
And everything she does is magic

388
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
The police and every little thing she does is magic

389
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Yes number two

390
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
And this is answer number three from 1987

391
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
This is Brick Ashley

392
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Sorry

393
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
We're gonna let you down

394
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
We're gonna walk and don't look back

395
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
We're gonna let you down

396
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
We're gonna go

397
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
We're gonna let you

398
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
We're gonna make you

399
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
We're gonna see you by

400
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,200
We're gonna see you by

401
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Answer number three

402
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Rick Ashley and ever gonna give you up

403
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
That's been great

404
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
It's number nine

405
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Thank you to you.

406
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Again, they were not very difficult at him, I think you had them all.

407
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Yes, finally.

408
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,200
The answers to this hit-est, and also the iTunes links can be found at hit-est.bacho.com.

409
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Next week I'll be back with Hit-est number 93, so I don't thank you for playing.

410
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
No, thank you for making.

411
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
And everyone else, thank you for listening.

412
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Until next week, take care, and bye-bye.

413
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Those of you...

414
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Excuse me, let me just wallow in my glory here for a second.

415
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Three out of three.

416
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Feeling good.

417
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
And the sun is shining today.

418
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Lots of requests to see young-pullet studio.

419
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,200
He's posted them now on his weblog, young-pullet.com.

420
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,200
And you can see young there, and his full glory in front of his...

421
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
No, no, no, it's not his studio.

422
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
What do we call it?

423
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
The lab.

424
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
It's the hit-test laboratory.

425
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Amongst many of the comments coming in as we've kind of shifted the focus.

426
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
And by the way, it's impossible that I'll be able to be talking about politics

427
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,200
and candidates and amendments and constitutional rights

428
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,200
completely until the 2008 elections.

429
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,200
So please, I know that as this show always has, it will shift course, shift focus.

430
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,200
And for those of you writing and calling and saying,

431
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Goodman, you've changed, man.

432
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
The show is all different.

433
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,200
I think the only thing constant about this show is that you can always expect change.

434
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Here's a comment relating to it.

435
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Adam, it's Mike from Windsor, Ontario, Canada.

436
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:53,200
I was looking to show 73 today a lot work on the assembly line, making many vans.

437
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
God bless you, man.

438
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Bless you for being on the assembly line, making many vans.

439
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,200
And I think it was Parkie who called when you referred to your listeners

440
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,200
as part of your family.

441
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,200
I have to admit that when you don't talk to your family the same way

442
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,200
that you talk to other people, I think I've seen me on text dry,

443
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,200
listen to him, tweet, and I've seen you on cranky geeks.

444
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
And when you're talking to those people or when you're on,

445
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
I guess you'd say with those folks,

446
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,200
it's nothing like when you're behind that mic either at the condo or at home in England.

447
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,200
It's like you're very personable when you're talking to us,

448
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,200
but when you're not in that situation, it's a whole different story.

449
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Also, no matter which direction you take the show, things gotta evolve.

450
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Everything's gotta evolve. It doesn't matter where you go.

451
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Your family will follow you, no matter what.

452
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,200
And how we put up with your second life,

453
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,200
excursion, we can put up with anything else.

454
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,200
I guess it's it for now, you look good work, and I'll talk to you, Adam Curry.

455
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,200
And you know, I only accept that from my family.

456
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Yeah, appreciate that.

457
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
And you make a very good point.

458
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
One of my wife makes all the time.

459
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
And by the way, why isn't she on the show anymore?

460
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
What's going on with that?

461
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Next week, I'll wrangle her in, it's time.

462
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,200
It's way overdue time to have the lady pee on the show.

463
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
So Patricia will always say, you know,

464
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,200
when you do interviews and when you're on talk shows and other people shows,

465
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
how come you're not yourself as what she says?

466
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,200
I say, well, I'm trying, you know, I am myself.

467
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
I'm myself in that moment.

468
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
I don't know.

469
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Yeah, but you're much looser at home and funnier.

470
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
And I think it has to do with the number of things.

471
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,200
One, and this is why I've always liked radio over television.

472
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I have complete control over this program.

473
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Every single thing that happens are at my fingertips.

474
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,200
My hands are running twice as fast as my brain sometimes,

475
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
just in making things happen.

476
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
And every single piece that goes on,

477
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,200
I'm in control of a very difficult with video.

478
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,200
You just need other people really to pull it off.

479
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,200
And, you know, if you have other people, you can't control it all yourself.

480
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
That's why I need a great team.

481
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Very, very hard to put great video or television teams together.

482
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
When you got it, you know, then shit really sings.

483
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
But anyway, so that's one small part of it.

484
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,200
But also, you're in my home right now.

485
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Wherever my home happens to be, at this moment, it's the manner.

486
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
I'm the west side of G2.

487
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
I'm in my bathrobe.

488
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
You know, I look like shit.

489
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
I'm on shaving.

490
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
My hair is all messy.

491
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,200
But I have this tool, you know, this microphone.

492
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,200
And it's funny, because I was thinking yesterday how wonderful this attic is.

493
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Because when I'm talking, I'm literally looking over the mic.

494
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,200
I mean, when you talk into a microphone, you got to look somewhere, right?

495
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Now, sometimes, of course, I look over at the screen and I'll read something.

496
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Or, you know, I have my notes.

497
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,200
And, you know, of course, I've got lots of, you know, cast blasters up and running.

498
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,200
But most of the time when I'm talking, I'm kind of in a Zen state staring off into space.

499
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm actually looking out of the beautiful bay window here in the attic.

500
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Looking at the trees, the colors, the blue sky, which is why you always hear me talking about the weather,

501
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
because that's what I'm looking at.

502
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,200
And when you're talking to someone else, it's, uh, it's sometimes just not as beautiful to look at.

503
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,200
It's hard, but I'm very conscious of how I can zone out when I get into, uh, getting to a vibe.

504
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:32,200
And this microphone, um, all my life, and I've been on the radio more than I've been on television or done anything else.

505
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,200
This microphone, it's, um, it's everything to me.

506
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Um, I travel with it.

507
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
I travel with my microphone.

508
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
It's my pen.

509
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
It is my, uh, it's my weapon.

510
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,200
It is, uh, it's my love stick.

511
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Connected to my love tube.

512
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Can you feel the love flowing through my tube into your earlobes?

513
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Hmm.

514
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Push those birds in deeper.

515
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
You know, Adam Curry's Chris Taylor from the Comprehensive Ania.

516
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,200
I'm still on wall between this run point.

517
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,200
It's a barricard bomber guy, but I'm starting to lean toward ground ball.

518
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,200
If you get it on the radio or on a video on the podcast, make sure you get some information from him.

519
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,200
If you're a folder or a scruncher, that little blue pill.

520
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,200
And if you get a good fuck you, Adam Curry, Adam.

521
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,200
I will talk to you, Adam Curry.

522
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Yeah.

523
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
Thanks, buddy.

524
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Yeah.

525
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
You know, um, so when I was talking to Jesse, the communications director, yes.

526
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
So I called him yesterday.

527
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,200
And, and I, and the first thing I said, hey, man, you know, I just got to tell you.

528
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,200
I really impressed that how fast this all came together.

529
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
And he says, and it was a silence.

530
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
And he says, are you being facetious?

531
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Did nobody talking about it?

532
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
I mentioned it last Friday.

533
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,200
On Monday, I already had people reaching out to me getting in touch with you.

534
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
And I was amazed.

535
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Oh, oh, I feel really good about that.

536
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Because I, we were feeling really embarrassed here about so many people had been writing and calling and saying

537
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Ron Paul has to be on the daily source code.

538
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
That they felt they'd actually been lagging behind a little bit.

539
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:05,200
And here we are exactly one week later after I said, you know, if this guy's campaign really is as together as it is.

540
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,200
And if he's really, um, if he really knows how to use, you'd lies the internet and this campaign understands it.

541
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
It'll happen.

542
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,200
And one week later, I am well impressed.

543
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Well, impressed, I have to say.

544
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,200
And so I, you know, I'm like, all right, how are we going to do this?

545
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,200
So I've come up with a format for, um, for the conversation, which I think will work.

546
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Now, I have some general questions and there's some stuff that is well known about Ron Paul,

547
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
but, you know, I'd like to ask further.

548
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Here's an example.

549
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
So, you know, he writes five million dollars.

550
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,200
He's, you know, once a raise, I think 12 million for, you know, by the end of the year.

551
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
My question is, how are you going to spend it?

552
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Now, of course, we know, but, you know, who's actually in charge of the media by?

553
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Who creates the, the commercials?

554
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Of all the things I've seen on YouTube and all the Ron Paul videos, the weakest by far,

555
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,200
the crappiest are the commercials that the campaign is putting together themselves.

556
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,200
You know, so I got questions about that.

557
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:11,200
I want to know why, if, I think I know the answer, but, you know, he's stated several times.

558
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
And this is what I hate about mainstream.

559
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,200
You know, so the mainstream, oh, man, I hope that's not the photographer already.

560
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
He's too early.

561
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
What time is it?

562
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
No, it can't be him.

563
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Mainstream, well, it likes to ask questions.

564
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
They already know the answers, too.

565
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,200
And I think partially to just, so they can slot it into the time available.

566
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
And so they look smart when they ask the question or whatever.

567
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,200
But, you know, well, Ron Paul, if you don't receive the, the Republican nomination,

568
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
are you going to run as an independent?

569
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
And I've all known as the answer.

570
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
His answer is no.

571
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Interesting.

572
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
No one's asking why?

573
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Why won't he?

574
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Again, I think I know the answer, but let's hear it from him.

575
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:55,200
But I also wanted him to understand the show and the community that surrounds it.

576
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
The family.

577
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,200
We, oh, fat, man, they.

578
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:08,200
So I said, you know, please Jesse, make sure that Ron Paul hears a show or at least part of a show.

579
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,200
He's got to understand what he's walking into because the world at large

580
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,200
that large and the daily source code audience, in particular, needs to know if he's a folder

581
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,200
or a scruncher.

582
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,560
I had to explain what that meant, of course.

583
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,480
I said, Jesse, communication is due.

584
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,880
You need to listen to the show.

585
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
Please.

586
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,400
And I said, you know, we're kind of crazy, you know, and people say fuck you to me, you know,

587
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,040
I didn't, I didn't go as far as to say, hey, I hope Ron Paul can give me a good fuck

588
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,040
you at the end, but, you know, if he really listens to it, then he should maybe catch

589
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
on.

590
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,040
We'll find out.

591
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,720
So anyway, the format for the questions, I was thinking, you will take like the top issues

592
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,040
we've been talking about, right?

593
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,240
So we have a second amendment.

594
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,760
We've got to follow the money, so that would be like our IRS Federal Reserve.

595
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,080
I think that we probably want to spend a little bit of time on the first amendment, which is

596
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,280
free speech, because I believe that he has actually, this is another, I'm going to suggest

597
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,480
something to him as well, you know, in all these,

598
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,280
interviews, you know, it's the same stupid story.

599
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,080
It's like, well, you've got a lot of support on the internet.

600
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,720
And then Ron Paul kind of in a doofus way goes like, ah, it's amazing.

601
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,520
We didn't know we don't know how it's happening.

602
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,200
Stop.

603
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,040
That's dumb.

604
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,760
If I can make a recommendation, which I'll do, he needs to be saying, we've cracked the code

605
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,720
of the internet.

606
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,120
Can you read the headline?

607
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,400
We've cracked the code.

608
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,400
We've figured out how to communicate through the internet.

609
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,040
Because that will scare the bejesus out of every other candidate.

610
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,640
Oh, shit.

611
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
Those guys figured it out.

612
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,680
How, how, how do they do it?

613
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,920
You know, they're doing them.

614
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,320
You running around trying to figure out how to, how to hop on board this internet thing.

615
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,560
And it's really simple, the well, why I believe, why he's cracked the code of the internet

616
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,880
is because the internet is a huge first amendment machine.

617
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,200
If anything, it's that, you know, it's where you get to say whatever you want to say.

618
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,280
And you can pretty much do it without any repercussions, whether it's in text or audio or

619
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:18,160
video or, you know, and, and, and hello, damn, I'm in the middle of it, leave me alone.

620
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,560
It's an amazing first amendment machine, freedom of speech machine and freedom and speech.

621
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,320
Well, if you speak to people about those things, that machine's going to start working.

622
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,360
Anyway, so what I'd like to do is I'd like to say, okay, please walk me through the second

623
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:41,720
amendment and how the second amendment, how you interpret that, Dr. Ron and how it fits into

624
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,680
your campaign, into your strategy and what you're going to do if and when elected.

625
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,920
So instead of saying, you are programs and have him go through the trouble of explaining

626
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:58,600
it all the way down to the constitution, since he is a constitutionalist and a libertarian

627
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,560
and a Republican man.

628
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,280
He's a lot of things.

629
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,640
I'd like to see if he can explain it from the ground up.

630
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,760
That will probably help.

631
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,800
That's why I'm giving you a homework assignment to learn a little bit more about the United

632
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,600
States constitution.

633
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,640
You won't be disappointed.

634
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,160
The guy that does this is pretty interesting.

635
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,200
It's literally a college classroom class and you're just kind of sitting along for the ride.

636
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,040
And I found it quite enjoyable.

637
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,880
Almost as enjoyable as the multitude of languages in which I'm learning to say, fuck you.

638
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,720
Hi, Adam.

639
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,840
She's my role.

640
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,880
You're an listener.

641
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,880
That's so cool, Adam.

642
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,840
Nah, fun cooler.

643
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,600
It was coming regards of your fuck you experiment.

644
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,480
I just remember that in Italy you have a competitor.

645
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:41,960
Oh, no.

646
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,800
You have somebody that I'm sure that your sister will look at the test more.

647
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:52,760
Is that a great law in Italian comedian who's been thrown up a lot of shit around the town.

648
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,440
It is a fun cooler campaign, which of course is fuck you in Italian.

649
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,760
And it will be interesting just to give a listen to and see how it is.

650
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,520
But for me instead is going to be the fun cooler.

651
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,560
I'm cool all.

652
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,760
Nice.

653
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,200
Well, there is no such thing as coincidence as also in the voicemail.

654
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,840
My darling little sister checking in from Italy.

655
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,480
No, bro, it's your sister calling in from Italy.

656
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,440
Oh, first of all, welcome home.

657
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,520
Yeah, I knew it.

658
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,160
I knew it.

659
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,800
You're a bit lost there with your iPhone, but you came back.

660
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,440
You came back.

661
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,440
Anyway, I've been listening to all your episodes.

662
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,000
Had a hard time though, because my drive to work is only 20 minutes.

663
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,800
Had a hard time getting all the stuff in.

664
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,000
But finally, I'm out today.

665
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,680
And I really enjoyed listening to all the comments and you endorsing Ron Paul.

666
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,600
And I've been looking things up.

667
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,880
And I like it when something gives me a push and start, you know,

668
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
getting more interested about something.

669
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,320
Yeah, and that's exactly what Ron Paul is done.

670
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,240
He's cracked to the code of the internet.

671
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,480
We all know how it works, obviously, but he's coming in.

672
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,200
He's cracking it.

673
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,560
What I thought was interesting is that we coming out of the same nest.

674
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,440
We have some reviews are just opposite.

675
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:21,320
And I know you keep saying, yeah, but Ron Paul and his ideas is not this or that.

676
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,480
It's just he doesn't want all the laws made by central government,

677
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,480
made by local states, local laws, and I fundamentally agree with that.

678
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,040
Because I think there are lots of things that are much better done and decided

679
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,480
at a local level or a state level could be schooling and that kind of stuff.

680
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,920
But there's so much stuff that's just shifting the problem.

681
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,480
You know, like, and I agree, like the drinking age, that's locally now.

682
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,840
I mean, the states, okay.

683
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,520
So that's what basically he would be doing by overturning the, what is it?

684
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,960
Rovers' weight thing.

685
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,320
Oh, excuse me.

686
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:07,400
Yeah, I think that's a big misunderstood part of what he's saying is how a lot of the things

687
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,600
that we regulate at a federal governmental level should be regulated by the states.

688
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,760
And I think that's really good.

689
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,760
We should probably talk to him about Rovers' weight because I got a couple of comments about that.

690
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,600
And again, I think I know the answer isn't I think I know how it is supposed to work and how it

691
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,720
probably could work.

692
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,360
But again, we've got to delve down a lot deeper because it's not just about

693
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,360
changing or abolishing one piece.

694
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,600
There's all all these pieces fit together.

695
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,520
So like national health care, you know, maybe that's something that shouldn't be

696
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,800
regulated by the government.

697
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,600
These are the things that we've got to figure out.

698
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,360
So yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't interrupt.

699
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,400
But he'd be doing just shifting the problem, the problem.

700
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,200
Yeah, the problem is, and look, first of all, no one's going to solve anything.

701
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,320
Not, or everything I should say.

702
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,760
That's just not possible.

703
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,280
We're a diverse group and humans by themselves are just when we never mind.

704
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,720
The problem from central government to the local government, what's going on?

705
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,840
What's going to happen?

706
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,680
Okay, one state allows abortions.

707
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,640
The other one doesn't, you know, I just go to the other state.

708
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,040
Yeah.

709
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,920
You know, to get an abortion.

710
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,960
I mean, I really think, you know, certain things.

711
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,920
Why not?

712
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,160
You don't solve the problem at a local level.

713
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,240
You're probably going to even solve them at a central level either.

714
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:33,000
But anyway, but I think he's sort of like, yeah, well, you know, the whole idea that he wants to

715
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
shift where the laws are made.

716
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,360
But he is pro-life, I'm pro-choice.

717
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,040
I mean, are we getting too long?

718
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,880
The biggest socially men, I don't even know what being pregnant means.

719
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,120
All right, let me just try and address this really quickly.

720
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,240
Because, of course, I have no fucking no idea what it's like to be pregnant.

721
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:49,880
Of course, I don't.

722
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,000
I'm pro-choice and I'm pro-life.

723
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,800
I guess pro-life means we also don't execute people,

724
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,960
which is kind of the whole craziness about this pro-life pro-choice.

725
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,080
Of course, it's your body.

726
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,160
You should be able to do anything you want with it.

727
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,440
What's so ever?

728
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,000
This is really a philosophical question because the first right you have

729
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,560
as an individual is your own body.

730
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,480
The question that is being raised is when are you an individual?

731
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,720
Correct. That's, you know what?

732
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,640
Let's stop killing it.

733
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,360
Let's stop shooting hot-letter each other in fucking deserts.

734
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,880
And then we can get around to this one.

735
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,560
I think that might be a larger issue.

736
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,880
Not trying to downplay it, understand everything,

737
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,520
have no answers, not running for president here.

738
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,960
These are, he helps to give him birth to 4,000 babies.

739
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,760
Anyway, and the second amendment, oh, I thought there was very interesting

740
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,560
that the listener who called in with the context,

741
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,400
because I really didn't know that.

742
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,760
And, oh, lots of stuff to say there, too.

743
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,240
I'm definitely for some control.

744
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,000
Um, just a quick fact, uh, let me ask you a question.

745
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,400
Uh, you live in Italy, different country, different politics, different system.

746
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,520
When the, uh, covering the area or whatever the hell they're called,

747
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,760
you know, the guys in the motorcycles with the white helmets,

748
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,880
covering, covering the area, covering for whatever their name is.

749
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,040
Uh, when you're driving down the road and you see those guys in your rear view mirror,

750
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,040
do you feel safe and think, wow, you know, that I feel protected because the

751
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,920
carbon area are behind me and they've got their guns and, and I'm safe.

752
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,720
I know that this is a safe country, or do you think yourself,

753
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,160
crap the carbon area behind me?

754
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,520
I hope they don't fucking hassle me.

755
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,040
I think I know the answer will, though.

756
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,560
I have lots of, uh, friend, mom, friends, as we call them in the states.

757
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,920
And once, uh, we, we were in contact by email.

758
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,760
And this, and this topic came out like, oh, do you let your kids go over to

759
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,880
a friend's house where you know, uh, they have a guns in the house or do you ask?

760
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,040
And I was like, why don't we tell them they're talking about, you know, it's just a reality.

761
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,720
It's something that doesn't exist here for me.

762
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,400
And I feel good about it.

763
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,040
I mean, you should hear them, you know, going about, oh, yeah, no.

764
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,800
First I call and I, and I ask and I say, do you have guns in the house?

765
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,720
And yes, and then some, some moms would let the kids play there.

766
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,680
Some wouldn't some.

767
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,120
Yeah, okay.

768
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,360
Um, um, that's, you know,

769
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,760
I don't want to piss off a whole bunch of people.

770
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,160
But that sounds to me like very typical.

771
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,600
I'm going to generalize if you don't mind.

772
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:35,800
Very typical suburban American housewives, soccer moms, uh, who are completely infiltrated by

773
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,160
fucked up media and get freaked out about every fucking thing that's been on this on the news.

774
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,680
It's freaking these people out.

775
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,200
That shit's got to stop.

776
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,120
It really, really has to.

777
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,720
I can give you a checklist.

778
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,840
Here's a checklist.

779
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,080
Do you have any guns? Do you have any drugs? Do you have any alcohol?

780
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,160
Do you have a swimming pool? Do you have a trampoline?

781
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,640
Do you have anything at all that could hurt my child when they're, uh,

782
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,680
it's crap. What is this?

783
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,400
No time for you.

784
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,880
That's the checklist you can go off.

785
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,240
And it's because of fear.

786
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,520
Willow.

787
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,080
It's fear.

788
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,760
These women are scared to death.

789
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,880
They're being scared and they're very on homes by television.

790
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,480
Let's see how it was like, you know, and, and, and, oh, yes, it's true.

791
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,680
Guns don't kill people.

792
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,480
People kill people.

793
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,320
They only promise what happens.

794
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,560
If it's little people who get their hands on the gun,

795
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,160
I mean, little little people.

796
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,440
So anyway, that besides getting into that,

797
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,080
no, just thought it was good for you to endorse Ron Paul.

798
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,000
If he feels he represents what, you know, you want.

799
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,960
The the candidate might, will be, uh,

800
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,400
Barack Obama, because he just does more whatever.

801
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,520
He's just mad.

802
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,040
Oh, that's the pleased.

803
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,880
Crikey. All mighty.

804
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:55,880
Fuck off.

805
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,720
Leave me alone.

806
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,200
Hey, if you can't articulate, why you're going to vote for Obama,

807
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,720
and what he stands for, you might want to reconsider.

808
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,440
He represents more of my ideas.

809
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,840
And then what I also thought was the thing was that people said,

810
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,200
or you were saying that people are saying that you've changed.

811
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,720
I don't think so much you've changed. I mean, just, no, you never pointed out

812
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,000
your views on certain things.

813
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,200
Oh, I didn't even know you thought about certain things in a certain way.

814
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
But that, well, I believe me.

815
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,760
Most of the time, I'm too stoned off my ass to think about anything.

816
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,800
So don't get worries.

817
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,160
That doesn't mean you've changed.

818
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,280
I think you're just mentioning things that you haven't mentioned before.

819
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,760
So anyway, lots of things to say on this topic,

820
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,880
and I would be, you know, I could talk about it forever,

821
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,520
but I see that I'm already going on way too long.

822
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:42,920
Uh-huh.

823
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,640
Looking forward to hearing him in an interview on your show,

824
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,360
and uh, that's it.

825
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,880
And now I'm supposed to say, uh,

826
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,120
fuck you into you, but it doesn't seem moral to say to my brother,

827
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,880
so I'll just say it in a time, it seems like a fancy.

828
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,000
Now that's fun, cool.

829
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,720
Fun, cool, though.

830
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,480
Mala, fun, cool, oh, y'all.

831
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,560
Hey, man, I know that was long, but it's my sister, you know?

832
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,600
This is how we communicate through the tubes,

833
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,760
through the tubes on the internet.

834
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,720
I need a break.

835
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,560
Oh, let's second down to it.

836
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,080
It is, of course, through our Friday,

837
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,160
so we got to bring in the official Music Colleges

838
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,920
Sergio, the Todd standing by,

839
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,840
with a really rough throat.

840
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,040
But still, man enough to bring us the pot safe.

841
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,480
You're not to make a motion.

842
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,320
It's my sister, my heart.

843
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,920
Man, I'm sorry, I'm just a child.

844
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,700
Today is Orlando, Um-hum.

845
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,360
It's time for your home.

846
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,240
And it's a football Friday.

847
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:59,000
With Josie Todd on the Charlie.

848
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,200
It's a football Friday.

849
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
With Josie Todd on the Charlie.

850
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,160
Well, have some fun out there,

851
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:17,480
Yo, how's it going Adam and Jersey Todd, the official musicologist of the Chacha?

852
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,520
Hey boss man, I gotta apologize right off the bat, because for the last couple of days

853
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,920
I've had the worst cold, in fact, for a couple of days I was going to court with no

854
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,920
voice at all.

855
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,600
I know, a lawyer without a voice, what good is that?

856
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,880
But telling me to shut up is like telling Lance Armstrong to get off the damn bike already.

857
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,360
Besides, I had to have to get out of football Friday for you, because I've got something

858
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,360
amazing.

859
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,200
Yeah, you might even remember it from your past.

860
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,920
So get out some hairspray, get out the bedazz or get out the ripped jeans and have a ball

861
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,880
with some of the other headbanders, because I'm bringing you a wasp.

862
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,040
Yeah, that's right, they're a pot safe now, and they've got a brand new album out calling

863
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,200
Doc called Dominator, and this is the song Mercy.

864
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,440
I know you're going to dig this, check it out, it's a wasp under through our Friday.

865
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:35,480
I'm going to take you there face down my bed, I'm really rules to see you smile.

866
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:42,480
I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this,

867
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:50,480
I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this,

868
00:44:50,480 --> 00:45:06,480
I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this,

869
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:15,480
I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this,

870
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:25,480
I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this,

871
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,480
I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this,

872
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:40,480
I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this,

873
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:56,480
I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this, I know you're going to dig this,

874
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,480
Cause man, when we're rolling out

875
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,480
You know we're making clouds on the sand

876
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,480
When we're going here, you know

877
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,480
I'll make it round for the sand

878
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,480
I'll make it round for the sand

879
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,480
I'll make it round for the sand

880
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,480
I'll roll

881
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,480
I'll roll

882
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,480
I'll roll

883
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:03,480
I'll make it round for the sand

884
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,480
I'll roll

885
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,480
I'll make it round for the sand

886
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,480
Gotta roll

887
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,280
I'll round

888
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,480
I'll roll

889
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:30,480
I'll make you cry for the same

890
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,480
I'll make you cry alive

891
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,480
Don't go to the line, cause man

892
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:43,480
I'll make you cry for the same

893
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,480
Nobody, nobody in the hell

894
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,480
I'll make you cry for the same

895
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,480
I'll make you cry for the same

896
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,480
I'll make you cry for the same

897
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,480
I'll make you cry for the same

898
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,480
A la la

899
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,480
That's why I'm talking about

900
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,480
Wast

901
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,480
Oh man, going back at time

902
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,480
Mercy, it's on the positive

903
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,640
same music now where they got another track up there as well.

904
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,320
You can check it out, show notes, at datingsourceco.com.

905
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:28,840
We'll contain links to everything played in this episode of the program, the football

906
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,880
Friday edition, DSC 475.

907
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,200
Ah crap.

908
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,760
Now I could do three hours of this with you guys.

909
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,920
Well actually, I can't because I just don't have the time with other commitments and I don't

910
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,240
think anyone could hang in that long.

911
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,560
That's the big difference between radio and independent media like we're doing is like, you know,

912
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:56,360
those guys got to do three hours to get one point across because no one tunes in for three

913
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,840
hours. And here I've got to get all my points into, you know, really I try to do 40 minutes

914
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,000
I'm already at 48. So yeah, go ahead. Look down at your iPod. You can see it's 48 minutes.

915
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:12,040
Hi, yes. Hey Adam. Yeah. I heard you yesterday talking about how a Gabby was a fruit.

916
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:22,200
Do your research. It's a fruit. Oh, fuck you. Okay, that's the route from which the Kila is derived.

917
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,760
Check out on the KilaTrail.podshow.com.

918
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,320
Hey Adam, this is Tony from San Diego. Thanks for turning me on to legacy of ashes and zeitgeist.

919
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:45,960
Both of them were really eye openers. But now what do I do? I feel like I'm trapped by all the messages

920
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:55,800
that are in this is life. There's no way we can overcome it. Yeah, I understand my friend.

921
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,840
And that's the whole point. I think that really is the point. You know, your brain's working.

922
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:08,040
Congratulations. You've just witnessed your brain going into overdrive. Now here's what you should do.

923
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,760
Take the other way to work today. Turn left instead of turning right. That's really good to

924
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,400
break your routine to get your brain juices flowing. The synapses are all firing in different

925
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,440
different patterns. Do everything you do today. Do it the other way around. Go left instead of

926
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,520
right. You still have to get to your destination. But, you know, pick something up with your left

927
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:31,320
hand instead of your right hand. It's really going to help your brain focus more. And please go check

928
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:35,960
out those constitution classes. Link at the show notes. Daddysourceco.com. Now I have,

929
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:42,600
let's see what I have lined up here. Another rovers is weighed. Another two second amendments.

930
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,080
I've got Derek from the UK. I just think it's I want to play one more song. I want to do the final

931
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,520
thought of the week. So I'm just going to do this one last one if you don't want to. I'm going on

932
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:58,040
with David from Jersey column and again. I've got six words for you. November, remember, remember

933
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,800
the fifth of November. Gunpowder translated into class. Some of your British listeners,

934
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,520
remember that as a guy for something. But this year it's going to be something a little bit different.

935
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:16,360
It's November, fifth, 2007. The Ron Paul campaign has set aside that day as a day of donation.

936
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,280
They're trying to achieve something along the lines of you and some of the other podcasts

937
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,560
did with bummer's the charts. But obviously for his political campaign.

938
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:28,920
A good idea. Now for all the you run all supporters out there if you have donated already

939
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,320
that would be great. If you could donate again, if you haven't, wait, wait for November fifth.

940
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:39,880
Because Ron is trying to look to gather news and my and all sorts of good publicity with this event.

941
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:46,840
So I've already signed up. I'm on the list and you can go to this November fifth.com.

942
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,280
That's the number five to eight for VV.

943
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,440
Victor. I signed up for a list so they can get an idea about how many people are actually going to

944
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,640
do the same. So anyone that wants to get them in there, let's do it. Take back America.

945
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,720
Nice. Fuck yeah, I'm good. Yeah, fuck you too. Hey, that's a good idea. Although I'm not quite

946
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,920
prepared. Everyone's saying, you know, happy to see you're endorsing Ron Paul. I haven't actually

947
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:14,040
endorsed him yet. In fact, the campaign sent over, you know, it's a real deal when you endorse

948
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:19,400
someone. It's not just saying I endorse him. There's actually a legal document that I need to sign,

949
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,840
which I haven't done yet for the Ron Paul campaign, which says I Adam Curry endorsed this candidate.

950
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:31,320
And you may use any quote I make in any campaign announcements, in any materials, etc. You know,

951
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:37,320
that's kind of like a like a movie endorsement. You know, it's like two thumbs up. Adam Curry,

952
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:45,800
Daily Source Code. A big fuck you from Adam Curry, Daily Source Code. So I have not done that yet.

953
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:51,080
And I'm not going to help with the bum rush the charts just yet until I feel confident I can

954
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,640
endorse and second. I do want to talk about the money and how it's being spent. It was going to be

955
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:01,960
spent on crap advertising. Well, shit, pod shows good at that. We expect much better.

956
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:09,240
So, but in all likelihood, yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm going to endorse this guy because, you know,

957
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:15,000
look at what's happening. This is the, this proves that this campaign has cracked the code to the

958
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,120
internet. What could be more viral than taking something that already exists. Remember, remember,

959
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:25,800
the fifth of November, the rest of the sentence has gunpowder, trees, and and plot. And I forget

960
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:31,640
all the rest. But yeah, completely a bum rush the charts. We know it's going to work. And I will get

961
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,800
behind the, of course. Now, you need some assets for that, which we'll talk about if, if we're actually,

962
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,840
if, you know, if I'm going to participate. So that's stuff to talk about. Let me just check my,

963
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:45,800
uh, my Google notebook here. Uh, a BBC in the news. I would be quite a miss if I, uh,

964
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:53,960
if I did not, uh, tell you that the BBC, now, the director general and the board of Grand

965
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,480
Pupas have announced that there has to be a 20% cut in the workforce over the next three years. And

966
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:05,560
the country's gone apeshit, apeshit, I tell you. Because, of course, although I haven't seen it

967
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,520
much, it would with my own eyes, uh, what's being said as well, you know, the cuts are the deepest in the

968
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:16,040
news department, the documentaries department, all the places where, uh, that the BBC is appreciated

969
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:21,000
for so much, you know, people are fighting for their existence, for their jobs, for what they believe

970
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,760
in, for their vision. It's on talk shows. It's all over the place. I just paid my 135 pounds

971
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:33,240
for another year of the TV license fee. Uh, so I'm, you know, I feel very much in control,

972
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,920
although, of course, I'm not because it's the government, essentially, that's making the decision,

973
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:43,560
um, about how much of the money is is going to be given to the BBC. It's pretty fucked up

974
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:51,480
situation, actually. Um, and of course, uh, you know, when you, when you try to organize your money

975
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,200
into to pay a resource, so it's our money here in the United Kingdom, we're giving it to the

976
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:01,080
government. The government then turns around and gives it all of it or maybe even more than it. I don't

977
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:07,480
know, uh, to the BBC, they decide how much goes in there and they're deciding, uh, what needs to be cut.

978
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:13,640
Um, I don't think I was asked. I was asked to pay before any choices were made, interestingly enough.

979
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,280
Um, it's just like government, public broadcasting. It's just like government. There's,

980
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,360
and I know how it works. I've worked at public broadcasting corporations and it's, uh, there's a lot of,

981
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:29,160
well, you get in government bureaucracy and pencil pushing and, uh, believe me, all this money is not

982
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,760
directly going onto the screen and into our ears. It's just not happening. So it's probably a good thing,

983
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:40,600
but, you know, you know, then you get like a Jonathan Ross who is a huge celebrity here. He has a

984
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:48,440
Friday night talk show. He does, uh, a Saturday, uh, talk show on the radio. Um, he does a movie review show.

985
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,520
He's entertaining, very popular. And you get six million pounds a year. And of course, that

986
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,840
pisses everyone off. You know, you could hire a lot of, uh, reporters for that money. But, you know,

987
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:02,040
it's always brought down to that level of, you know, one to one. And then I don't even know if the

988
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:07,240
cuts actually are taking place in people who are directly responsible for making programming or

989
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:12,280
reporting news or making up the news for that matter. All right, one more, one more before

990
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:18,440
we get the final father day. Hi, out of my name's Gorn. Um, I'm, you know, one kind of listener, I guess.

991
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:24,920
And, uh, I don't know, I've kind of been holding back listening to all of your shows about the, uh,

992
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:33,000
the essay and, uh, and it's just the ongoing of, uh, the American government for the,

993
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:41,320
so organizations that are quote-unquote really the American government. Uh, and basically,

994
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:48,520
uh, you made a comment about, uh, something, uh, the 72 hour notice before you can fly and you

995
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:54,360
have to be free of food to get your boarding fast. And I, uh, this is, uh, a new regulation that TSA

996
00:56:54,360 --> 00:57:01,560
is proposing that, uh, for any travel to the United States or over the United States, excuse me,

997
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:10,440
that you would essentially have to book 72 hours in advance so you can be screened and approved

998
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:16,600
for this type of activity for sitting in a chair full of beer farts eating fucking peanuts.

999
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:24,920
I say, let it happen. I mean, really, um, maybe for once, you know, there'll be something to push

1000
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:32,760
and track or some other train, train company to fill their own train tracks so people will stop,

1001
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,720
uh, you know, well, basically fly because they'll have to, you know, because, you know,

1002
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:43,320
you know, who the hell, you know, if you go through 150 steps just to take that an hour flight

1003
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:49,480
to Chicago or something like that, um, I live in Ohio, I drive 45 minutes to and from work every

1004
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:55,640
day and I would love it if there was a train that I could commute on through, uh, whatever.

1005
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:04,360
So the point being, uh, it's ridiculous, uh, as a United States citizen, I have the right to travel

1006
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:11,720
and that, uh, sounds to me like this right is being taken away. I can't travel when I want to.

1007
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,720
I know where does it say you have the right to travel when to prove. You have the right to travel.

1008
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,360
Man, these are complicated issues. And, you know, and my brain is so tiny just by being a man

1009
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:28,360
first of all, much tiny than a woman's brain. It just hurts. One more, you've got to read just

1010
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:33,080
of while we're on the TSA and again, this is just another link in the show notes, uh, screeners at

1011
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:39,080
Los Angeles International Airport, uh, according to USA today who did an under-covered covert study

1012
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:44,120
failed 75% of, uh, oh, no, they didn't do the study. The TSA did the study themselves. USA today

1013
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:51,720
got the leaked story or the report was leaked to them. Screeners failed 75% of all bomb detection tests.

1014
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:57,480
Well, gee, there's a surprise. You read this. You're just going to be laughing. So what I've always

1015
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,520
been saying, you can get any kind of shit you want through TSA. It's horseshit. It's, it's trickery.

1016
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:08,840
It's mockery, really. It's not based on reality. However, I hear they do have a

1017
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:17,160
100% hit rate at finding my KY intrigue lubricant. It's Friday.

1018
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,800
Yeah, and of course, I've, uh, resorted to using KY intrigue lubricant, uh, ever since

1019
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:32,840
Sir George W Bush has been fucking me up the ass. Mine's won't make it a little bit more pleasurable.

1020
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:39,160
All right. They're really poor, Bart. I got to get out of here. I got to get to take a shower.

1021
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,800
I got to get ready for my photo shoot. As a final thought of the week, well, you have homework.

1022
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:49,640
The final thought is, please, please, please. I look at these constitution classes. It's

1023
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,040
really interesting. It'll enrich you as a human being. It'll give you a history lesson you've never

1024
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,760
had before. Even if you are a United States citizen and was schooled in the United States,

1025
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,040
uh, it's certainly something that I am completely engrossed in and loved watching and

1026
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:09,560
and I can't wait until I finish all of them. The final thought? Well, I think,

1027
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,640
you know what? I'm going to say it in a song this time. Let the organization for the preservation

1028
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,720
to the soundtrack of our lives give us the final thought of the week.

1029
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:45,880
What is segregation? I don't know what generation is. Uh, what is big injury?

1030
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:52,520
I don't know what degree it is. What does, uh, hatred me?

1031
01:00:52,600 --> 01:01:00,840
Uh, I don't know what it is. Uh, what is prejudice?

1032
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:05,880
Um, I think it's when it's in my thick.

1033
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:40,040
I don't know what I think. I don't know what I think. I don't know what I think.

1034
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:44,120
I don't know what I think. I don't know what I think. I don't know what I think.

1035
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:52,280
I don't know what I think. I don't know what I think. I don't know what I think.

1036
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,280
Anybody?

1037
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:04,120
See my old friend John. Can you tell me where he's called?

1038
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:09,720
We're at the trademark. The motor case is coming by here. I can see many motor cycles coming by

1039
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:15,000
and I'm police motor cycle. Just have to come on the radio. Oh, goodness, so long and tough to know.

1040
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,160
So take up the motor case, something is happening here. We understand it is fishy.

1041
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:23,560
The presidential car coming up now. We know it's the presidential car. We see Mrs Kennedy's feet still.

1042
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,360
There's a secret service man. Let's go over the top of the car. We're at the top of the car.

1043
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,000
We're at the top of the car. We're at the top of the car. We're at the top of the car. We're at the top of the car. We're at the bottom of the car.

1044
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,120
We're at the bottom of the car. We can't see who has been hit.

1045
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,960
If anybody has been hit, but if there's something is wrong here, something is terribly wrong.

1046
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,960
I mean behind the motor case, we need to follow the motor motor cycle. We're going to park on the hospital.

1047
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,640
The interruptives programmed to bring you a special bulletin.

1048
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:53,640
Dollars Texas, the flash, apparently official, President John F. Kennedy, died at 1 p.m.

1049
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,600
Central Stanford Times.

1050
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:18,920
That's your cold days ahead. But it will not matter with me now.

1051
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,840
Because I've been to the mountain top.

1052
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,120
Like anybody, I would like to live.

1053
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:38,440
No one can be certain who next was suffered from some fenced black of bloodshed.

1054
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:49,720
And Bobby, can you tell me when he's gone?

1055
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,680
There, your audience just said he meant that we've been here too long already.

1056
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:02,040
So, well, my thanks to all of you and I'm going to Chicago and that's with me.

1057
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:09,640
Senator Kennedy has been shut. Is that possible?

1058
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,920
Oh my God. Senator Kennedy has been shut.

1059
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,360
There's a lot to say about hold of a man.

1060
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,400
Oh, apparently. That's part of this guy.

1061
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,280
That's a guy. That's a guy.

1062
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,280
There away from the guy.

1063
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,400
That's your guy.

1064
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,080
His hand is frozen.

1065
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,880
Take a hold of his arm and break it if you have to.

1066
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,080
It is so.

1067
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,040
All right.

1068
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,640
I can't break it.

1069
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,200
I can't break it.

1070
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,320
That's a guy and break it.

1071
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,280
That's a guy.

1072
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,320
Hold him, hold him.

1073
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,280
We don't want another off-road.

1074
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:45,400
Like it or not, we live in times of danger and uncertainty.

1075
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,880
That is the way he lived.

1076
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,600
That is what he needs us.

1077
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:58,840
I'd rather need not be idealized or enlarged and dead beyond what he was alive.

1078
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,520
Be remembered simply as a good and decent man.

1079
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,280
So wrong and try to write it.

1080
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,880
So are suffering and tried to heal it.

1081
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,560
So are war and pride to stop it.

1082
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:19,880
Those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today,

1083
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,920
pray that what he was to us.

1084
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,280
What he wished for others was someday come the past for all the world.

1085
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,880
As he said many times, in many parts of this nation,

1086
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:38,120
those he touched and who sought to touch him.

1087
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,800
Some men's seat things as they are and say why.

1088
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:48,280
I dream things that never were and say why not.

1089
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:10,840
But for him we come.

1090
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,160
What is segregation?

1091
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,680
I don't know what segregation is.

1092
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,600
What is bigotry?

1093
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,720
I don't know what bigotry is.

1094
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:31,240
What does hatred mean?

1095
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:38,520
I don't know what is prejudice.

1096
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,600
I think it's when it's in my seat.

1097
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,800
The best in the brightest served up daily by the sharpest minds and content delivery.

1098
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,400
Pajo and limite.
