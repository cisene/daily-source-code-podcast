00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Port City PD, the number one online police drama series, is now available.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,720
The pod father had a cameo in the season 1 finale, who will be making cameo appearances

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,720
in season 2.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,720
You?

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,720
Me?

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,720
Get in on the action.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,720
The city dot podshow.com.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,720
And now something really amazing, the DSC 639.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,520
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,720
content in my ears.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,720
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,400
Ag esque, it's Adam Curry.

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Oh, baby, I'll make it a place in my life

14
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:21,720
I'll sit around the way you want it just like my life

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:36,720
Sounds to be natural, I've been so crazy when I'm alone

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,720
Love, love, love, love, love

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,720
I'll take your senses, love, love, love

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,720
You're truly close to me, you're in my life

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,720
I'll sit around the way you want it just like my life

20
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:11,720
I'll sit around the way you want it just like my life

21
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:24,720
I'll sit around the way you want it

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,720
I'll sit around the way you want it just like your life

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,720
I'll sit around the way you want it just like your life

24
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:53,980
Oh yeah, if you ask me that's the way rock roll songs should be short, sweet, full of

25
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:02,060
attitude, black tie review there from Penn State, well Penn State, Pennsylvania, State

26
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,860
known as Penn.

27
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:10,100
Absent radio kicking off Tuesdays daily source code episode 639 from the affluent suburb

28
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,660
of swanky Surrey from on the west side of Vagueilford.

29
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,260
This is the daily source code coming to you from the Curry Manor, beautiful day today.

30
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,660
Uh-huh, last week I made a prediction and I was getting comments about it.

31
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,660
Ah, here we go.

32
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,060
I'm going to go and the garden isn't a DSE636, so whether it's beautiful, it's just

33
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,060
going to be fantastic.

34
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,060
Here we go.

35
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:49,060
And let me make a prediction right now, you know what I mean, it's a weather, really

36
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,060
tough.

37
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,140
If you're having some, you have this, I knew how weather, prediction and please hold

38
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,220
me to this next week is going to be, you, T, full in the United Kingdom, next week is going

39
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,220
to be, B, T, full in the United Kingdom, bank on it, oh, it's true, that becomes TSC639.

40
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:15,820
I love the rain drops, the point point, very noisy rain drops, you have there, yeah,

41
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,340
yeah, I should have been a little more clear, I'm expecting the weather to be great

42
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,340
in South East England.

43
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,740
I keep forgetting how big this place really is, you know, that, that friggin, many that

44
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,420
Christina wants up in, uh, it's a new castle, man, those guys are flooded out all the way

45
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,420
up there.

46
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,300
And let me tell you, it's a disaster.

47
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,820
I remember quite distinctly a number of Brits scuffing, guffing and scuffing, scuffing, that's

48
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,980
it's scuffing and guffing at, uh, at the Katrina disaster in the United States.

49
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:53,660
Well, excuse me, this is, I'd say, pretty damn comparable and completely unprepared.

50
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,700
And now, of course, the same reports are popping up here.

51
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,060
The government knew about the, uh, the lack of, of water management, uh, particularly the

52
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,380
roads and the so-called floodplains.

53
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,140
They knew about that three years ago here in the UK.

54
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,740
Gordon Browns got his work cut out for him.

55
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,820
And I think he's, uh, he's tackling this one head on, but man, you can just see the bags

56
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,660
under his eyes, you know, droop lower and lower there about to drop down over his cheekbones

57
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,060
because his tough, tough, tough, tough situation, really tough what's going on here.

58
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,580
And of course, now that, you know, the, the crisis has actually reached the outskirts

59
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,580
of London.

60
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,580
Oh, no, let's pay some attention to it, really, really unbelievable.

61
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,580
It's going on here.

62
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,660
Now, another day, I got to go to, uh, to London office.

63
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,860
It's going to be another busy week.

64
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,500
I hope to, to eat out five shows, but you know me, it could easily turn out to be

65
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
four.

66
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,260
I, in fact, I'm even going to stay in the city Thursday evening for an early Friday morning

67
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:51,020
meeting, but things are going so well, uh, you know, Dr. Cockney ever since we, uh,

68
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,380
we hooked up with news of the world is just exploding unbelievable, download

69
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,980
requests have quadrupled.

70
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:03,140
So we found a very good partner, I think, and this and, uh, it's just cool stuff going

71
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,140
on here.

72
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:10,660
I think, I think when, uh, probably, um, end of August, I'll probably go to the United

73
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,620
States for about six weeks in a row and try and replicate exactly the same thing we've

74
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,100
done here.

75
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,180
And amidst all of that, cheddar is coming out today.

76
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,020
I can smell the cheese from where I'm at already.

77
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,300
Uh, yesterday, I approved all of the functionality and, uh, disapproved one, the, uh, the

78
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,340
get channel functionality.

79
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,860
I'm, we're not going to release with get channel in the, uh, in the initial build.

80
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,580
You'll be able to, uh, to edit your channels, uh, at podshow.com, uh, you'll have tremendous

81
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,380
amount of control over the output of those channels.

82
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,420
What the output looks like and what it plays on.

83
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,380
And I already have more ideas of stuff I want to build into it, um, that should be

84
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,020
out sometime today.

85
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:54,060
Um, I post that, uh, an internal email, uh, edited, of course for the protectors of

86
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,300
inside the corporation.

87
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,740
Um, uh, I did that on curry.com.

88
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,780
You could see that the releases planned, uh, for tomorrow, 3 p.m., that'll be Pacific

89
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,780
Standard Time.

90
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,140
So it won't be until later tonight, but, uh, shit's coming.

91
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,460
Then when I say a shit, I mean, cheese.

92
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,620
I mean the cheddar.

93
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:25,660
Hey, they're Adam.

94
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,660
Hey, baby.

95
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
He may send.

96
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,660
Hey, Rachel Krill fan.

97
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,660
Just checking in.

98
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,980
I was hoping you'd like to play a game with me.

99
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,980
You like games, don't you?

100
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,980
Oh, I love it.

101
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,340
No handcuffs or feathers involved in this one.

102
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,980
But you seem to know an awful lot about ancient 80s music.

103
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Of course.

104
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:48,900
Of course stuff, like HTML that pod this and pod that, but do you know your pop culture?

105
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
Yes, of course.

106
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
For a game, Adam.

107
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,900
Yes, of course.

108
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,900
Oh, good.

109
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Like a hit test.

110
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,300
Now, I believe you just took Kudotter, Christina, to see Justin's in the link.

111
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
Yep.

112
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:07,340
The question is, who is he rumored to be dating, uh, Jessica, um, Alba, no, um, Jessica,

113
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,340
something.

114
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,340
So did you get that one, Adam?

115
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,340
No.

116
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,740
That my boy, J.T.

117
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,980
Is dating Jessica Biel.

118
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,980
Biel.

119
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,980
Question number two.

120
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,980
I was going to have a point.

121
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,820
I love the lady Patricia has competed in the global sensation dancing with the stars,

122
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,900
which is also a huge hit here in the United States.

123
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,700
Who won the most recent U.S. version of dancing with the stars?

124
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,820
Well, I watch this show, obviously.

125
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,700
Apollo, whatever the guy's name is, Apollo.

126
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,420
Hello.

127
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,900
The winner was Apollo Anton Ono.

128
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,740
Oh, no, Heather Mills leg did not fly off because I know you care so much, Adam.

129
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,300
Last question is, who is older?

130
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,620
Brad Pitt's daughter, Shilo, or Tom Cruise's daughter, Surrey.

131
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,300
I'm pretty sure the cruise has had their daughter first.

132
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,460
So I'm going to go with the cruise kid.

133
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,740
Sorry, cruise is 39 days older than Shilo.

134
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,580
Surrey was born April 18th, while Shilo was born May 27th.

135
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,340
Yeah.

136
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,820
So how did you do, Adam?

137
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,380
Well, three.

138
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,060
I do like to play the game.

139
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,780
Would you like to play some more?

140
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,900
If you do, I think you're going to need some brushing up on your pop culture.

141
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Please.

142
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,460
So subscribe to Brittany Mason's, the pop cast with your host, David Jen, at the

143
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,060
popcast.potcho.com.

144
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,060
Ciao.

145
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,700
Okay, Brittany.

146
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,540
Finally, we got that promo to work for you.

147
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,780
And I didn't want to listen to it because I didn't want to, you know, I didn't want

148
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,340
to know the answers before I did the test.

149
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,140
I think I got three, well, at least two and a half.

150
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,140
I got the, I didn't get Jessica Biel right.

151
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,140
Okay.

152
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,700
I, if that's going to be in a regular basis, that's pretty cool.

153
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,380
I'll subscribe to that.

154
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,860
I'll put that in my iPhone channel.

155
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,260
Oh, people.

156
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,260
Oh, people.

157
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,060
Oh, the iPhone.

158
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,460
My goodness.

159
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,500
This thing is has changed my life.

160
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,940
I have to tell you, I'm, you know, still evaluating battery life.

161
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,660
It finally got a full charge last night.

162
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,420
So today, going into the city, we'll see how well it does.

163
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,540
I'm taking along the charger just in case.

164
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,700
One thing I've found that is completely, completely full barred about this device.

165
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,980
There's an, an automatic spell character in the, in the, in the typing system.

166
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,740
Now, this typing system, I'm actually, I'm kind of getting there, you know, the placement

167
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,740
of the, of the virtual keys, the visual feedback you get when you hit a key, which is kind

168
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,140
of nice, a big, you know, the letter, it kind of explodes up real quick so you can see

169
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,460
that you hit the right one.

170
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,460
I turn off the clicks because I don't like the, even though it's a really good feedback mechanism,

171
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,220
I find it highly annoying, particularly when I'm in bed under the covers while Patricia's

172
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,220
trying to sleep.

173
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:51,180
And I'm there with the iPhone, click, click, click, click now, that's not good.

174
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,580
But that, you know, you can't, for some, you can't seem to turn off this, it's like

175
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:01,780
predictive text or T9 that you would find on, on the Nokia, I hate it because, because,

176
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,180
here, so first of all, it only does English.

177
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,060
So, if I'm writing a message in Dutch, then it doesn't work and it, and, you know, you

178
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,140
have to physically go up and say, no, do not correct it.

179
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:19,540
It's not an opt-in, it's an opt-out, which is great if you're doing speed typing in English.

180
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,060
But if you're doing any other language, it's really cumbersome gets in the way.

181
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,100
And of course, when you're doing text messaging, it is the most cumbersome of all because

182
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,660
text messaging really exists of, you know, shorthand, short code, like instead of

183
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,580
why oh you, you do you instead of T-O-O, you do numeral two.

184
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,820
So it's continuously correcting, even English, if I want to say, in, it'll correct it

185
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,980
to I'm stupid, lame, need to be able to turn it off.

186
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,220
If there's any hackers out there who are working on this thing, I'm sure that through

187
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:54,220
the jailbreak software, we can disable that, it's so cumbersome.

188
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,460
So that's really, really bad.

189
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,340
Google Docs, on the other hand, I found out, actually works, it's unbelievable.

190
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,780
I've really done a, I'd have to say, a pretty good job.

191
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:11,980
And I'll continue to, to feedback and, and let, you know, what the experiences are.

192
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,300
But again, so far, it's all about the interface.

193
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,380
And it's really, really changed the way I look at the mobile web.

194
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,660
In fact, nice little discussion there on yesterday's show at podshow.com.

195
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,820
The DeadlySourceCode.com, commentary blogger, you know, saying, hey, you know, if you're

196
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,780
convinced that this is the way to go, now you only have to convince the 100 million, you

197
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,860
know, that the 500 million other people who don't have an iPhone, I think that this

198
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,260
is bar setting.

199
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,820
I think that, now, depending on the patents, which, of course, could make this whole thing

200
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:45,820
really suck, I believe everyone has to come out with a similar type of experience, you

201
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:52,140
know, that it doesn't have to be the pinch for Zoom and all that, but, man, I, you

202
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,100
know, I, I, I still, I think that they're not making any money on these things.

203
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,620
This screen, this technology must be extremely expensive, that just no way around it.

204
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,260
But damn, it's worth it.

205
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Comic strip.

206
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Comic strip.

207
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,260
Comic strip.

208
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,260
Comic strip.

209
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,260
Comic strip.

210
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,260
Comic strip.

211
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
Comic strip.

212
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,260
Ah, he's back.

213
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,260
Thank goodness.

214
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,260
Hello, Adam.

215
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,260
Hello.

216
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
Very caring.

217
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,700
When you were interviewing Madonna, yeah, and her vagina goes crazy.

218
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,700
Wait a minute.

219
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,700
Wait a minute.

220
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,460
See, as B, I try to keep it a little friend for family, friendly.

221
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,180
He's referring to my conversation about Madonna, where they edited the whole piece to look

222
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,180
really good instead of bitchy as the way she was at the time of the interview.

223
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,380
Alright, let's plug your ears and the kids to their room.

224
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,780
It's comic strip blogger.

225
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,780
You too.

226
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,780
You're annoying questions.

227
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,620
She just left the room.

228
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,780
Big deal.

229
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:57,620
But when I was interviewing certain top manager from Sun Corporation, makers of Java about

230
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,740
mobile Java, I was interviewing him, then he grabbed my recorder brutally, stopped it, ordered

231
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,780
me to delete their recording, and taught me to fuck off.

232
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,020
And well, did I do too offend his vagina?

233
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,460
Well, I think you're just your entire attitude and approach is pretty damn offensive

234
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,340
to most people who have something to defend.

235
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,540
Alright, we've met, I've met comic strip blogger, and I like him, and he's my kind

236
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,540
of guy.

237
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:32,180
He is in your face and brash, and you, someone could call it just pure honesty, but it's

238
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,660
definitely not the personable approach that CEOs of large companies are used to.

239
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,460
And of course, they used to complete control over their messaging.

240
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,540
So, whatever it was, it was probably just the frightening look in your eyes that pissed

241
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,540
them off.

242
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,420
So, yes, be really wasn't the question at all, you know, oh my god, no matter what I say,

243
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,420
this guy is dangerous.

244
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,020
Danger, warning will robins.

245
00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:03,700
I just asked how mobile Java compares to flesh that easily is scalable to all resolutions.

246
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:10,700
So, I'm very happy that Steve Jobs said that he doesn't like Java, and will not put

247
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:18,820
this Java shit on the iPhone, well, I don't give a fuck about your metrics talk.

248
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:25,020
When it's this about general deception, about life and so on, but please, could you also

249
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:31,820
talk about deception when it comes to marketing of various products and services?

250
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:40,460
By the way, I am blooped, take care, and loving it, yeah, you can't fool me.

251
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:46,780
Unless, of course, keeping in the matrix metaphor, you are a century, that is very possible.

252
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,620
You thought those centuries were the guys and the black suits were the black shades on

253
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:56,540
actually, they all look like comic strip blogger.

254
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,020
Deceptive marketing practices, I don't think there's so much as deceptive as, you know,

255
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:09,180
the same practices are applied, you know, sex is really used in 99.9% of all advertising,

256
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,980
you know, again, CSB, I'd like you to take the Zen TV experiment.

257
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:19,980
Please check it out and let me know how you fare it on that, because, you know, what basically

258
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,260
sells is, hey, if you drink this beer, you'll get laid, if you buy this car, you'll

259
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,980
get laid.

260
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:32,380
If you use this, this is it, you'll get laid, it's what it's all about, it's about not

261
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:38,140
dying, being very successful and wealthy, or getting laid, that's all that advertising

262
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,140
is about.

263
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:45,820
It's playing into the purest form of emotions, and by the way, you know, this is what reality

264
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,620
television is all about, you know, this is what drama is about.

265
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,620
We all understand the basic human emotions of joy, sadness, fear, and maybe there's an

266
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:02,300
escalation to terror, and it's really, in fact, the easiest is to play into terror,

267
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,060
by even calling it terrorist, war on terror, it's so simple.

268
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:14,340
So, you know, that's what advertising does, man, and advertising is used for everything.

269
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:19,260
You advertise when you present an idea, you know, and you may, you know, you present to

270
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,540
a corporation the way you did to us on your beautiful, the best presentation I've ever

271
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,780
seen, by the way, comic strip blogger, I've told you about that, had a great slide show

272
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,180
which ended with fuck you Adam Curry, it was perfect, I showed it to the board of directors,

273
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,180
they loved it.

274
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:40,940
I said, we're picking up some good quality business leads, you know, that very clearly,

275
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,900
you said, if you don't implement this plan, you know, pod show will die, and I don't

276
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:52,500
want pod show to die, anyway, I know how to play into your emotions on this show,

277
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,140
I do it all the time, and the easiest way for me to play into your emotions is for you

278
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,460
to recall the emotions that are relevant to you, to each individual, and we do that through

279
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:18,620
something called the soundtrack to our lives.

280
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:24,460
Actually it's this, and we're at number 79 right now, oh and I got some requests for this

281
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:32,900
one, I thought wild, why not, oh and, of course, there's something else I would like

282
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,780
to share with you, and that is this sound, can you tell what it is?

283
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,980
I know what that is, I've heard that one before, every dad in the world, from some sort

284
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,220
of tests, not a hit test, it's something else.

285
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:52,980
It worked, and it's someone that's due January 27th, awesome thing, awesome of the next

288
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,380

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,360
Again, they were not too difficult, so where do I hope you had them all?

301
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,680
Oh yeah man, of course.

302
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,480

And next week I'll be back for number 80.

304
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,840
So until then, take care and bye-bye.

305
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
Awesome.

306
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
What the hell?

307
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,720
Oh, it's the hard beat.

308
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Awesome.

309
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Hitest, John.

310
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,920
And congratulations to you and your girlfriend as we say in the engineering business.

311
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
It worked.

312
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,520
Clearly it worked.

313
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,640
Of course, in the drama business, we say, who done it?

314
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
Oh, man.

315
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,640
I love those songs.

316
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,040
They were, I mean, they were what we call open doors, very easy to guess those awesome

317
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
editing job.

318
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Beyond.

319
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,680
Of course, the hitest is brought to you by the organization for preservation to the soundtrack

320
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
of our lives.

321
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Upsold.org.

322
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,480
They don't have a website yet, but they're for real, at least their intent is.

323
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,280
And as John said, hitest.boxio.com, you can find all of the answers, the clean version

324
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
of the hittest.

325
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,680
And of course, the links to all of these songs and iTunes.

326
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,520
And if I had, well, if I had 30 cents for every single song, we sold through iTunes

327
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
in that manner.

328
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,920
Oh, let me tell you.

329
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,680
Oh, let me just scan through, I've been saving stuff.

330
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,680
I've been starring stuff, I should say, in Google Reader.

331
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,240
Let me just see if there's anything that I wanted to talk to you about.

332
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,760
This is interesting on slash dot, email is like so dead.

333
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,320
Group of teenage internet business entrepreneurs confess that they really only use email

334
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
to talk to adults.

335
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,600
You know, I'd have to say that's true, at least that's what I'm seeing with Christina.

336
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,960
She seems to be living in Facebook these days.

337
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,960
I'm trying to gauge it.

338
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,600
I'm trying to see if she's on my space more than Facebook.

339
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,120
It seems like Facebook and, you know, I've tried to inquire, you know, why or what or what

340
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
she likes about it.

341
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,520
And it's kind of hard.

342
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,920
She can't really explain it.

343
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:44,320
It's like crack, I guess, and it has a lot to do with, you know, the quick hit fix

344
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,800
of instant messaging and all these things kind of tied into one, but it's, it's really

345
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
quite amazing.

346
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,400
Let me just check the notebook here.

347
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,400
Oh, this is a good one.

348
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,640
PG Kelly, who sends me emails on a daily basis, said, why don't you have Doug and his

349
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,120
son work on the prep of Trinity, have them deliver Trinity to Sean and Amy?

350
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,440
That would be kind of good.

351
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:11,800
San Francisco to, well, why don't we have Shane and Amy go from Chicago to Boston and pick

352
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,720
it up there and then start in Boston.

353
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,440
That's a, that's a pretty good idea.

354
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,720
I'm still looking for a great, a great way to, to pin for out.

355
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,480
Oh, this is going to be cool.

356
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
So that's starting in November.

357
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,720
I'm so happy we're finally figuring out the, the free Trinity project and are able to

358
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,320
morph that with a, a here at the wheel.

359
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
Those guys are pretty awesome.

360
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,160
Jason Chaser used to be an ordinary college student, but now he works for the FBI hunting

361
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,040
down criminals with special abilities, using a special ability of his own.

362
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,920
You can see the aura that surrounds every living creature.

363
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,360
This aura allows Jason to see what someone is going to do before they do it with a hundred

364
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
percent accuracy.

365
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,840
How would Jason's powers evolve?

366
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Will he bring in these criminals dead or alive?

367
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,240
And how will his relationship with the lovely Catherine Wolf develop?

368
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,040
That is up to you.

369
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,240
The Aurora Hunter by Marcus Noble is the first ever audience choice podcast novel.

370
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,680
Subscribe at hunternovel.podshow.com for all the details on how you can help shape this

371
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,320
story.

372
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,040
You know, this whole audio novel thing is so awesome.

373
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,360
And we're working out a fantastic, fantastic agreement for authors who want to participate

374
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,040
and want to do an audio novel.

375
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,960
And want to be published because podshow press will actually publish you.

376
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,720
Marcus Ocean Martin M. Cough is spearheading that and there's going to be some awesome

377
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
books.

378
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,400
It's just, it's so right.

379
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
It's one of those things.

380
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,480
You know, you just kind of stumble on it started for us, at least it started with the Scott

381
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,680
Sigler and Shadow Falls and the formats been refined and we're going to make it very

382
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,120
much like the pod save music network where, you know, you get promotion of course by putting

383
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,520
your songs up and podcast playing your songs and you can sell through the pod save music

384
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
network.

385
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,480
It's not perfect yet, but we take none of the money, all of the revenue except for nine

386
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:12,680
cents transaction fee, which is charged by clicking by the artist goes directly to them.

387
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,960
It's not perfect, of course, but it's a start.

388
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,880
And so, too, for the sales of the books, you know, all of the revenue from the books.

389
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,000
And I think that's actually not bad.

390
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,920
I think it's like seven bucks or something.

391
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,320
Don't hold me to it.

392
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,040
But that goes directly to the authors after we've done the audio novel, which is the new

393
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
model.

394
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,600
It's published the audio book, the audio novel, episodically by chapter.

395
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:41,760
At the end of that release, a hardcover or paperback version book, it works.

396
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,240
So you know, I'm going to be up late tonight as Cheddar gets released.

397
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,760
I can't wait for you guys to be trying this out.

398
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,240
Very minimal changes for those who aren't interested except every single channel you'll

399
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,240
see, you'll be able to access in a different manner.

400
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
You'll be able to play out in a different manner.

401
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,520
Oh, my gosh, I'll even be in RSS icon.

402
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
Oh, stand back.

403
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
Chapter of Dama.

404
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,520
Hey, I never go to call myself, whatever.

405
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,240
I just have a quick reaction about the channel's thing, number one, I think it's as cool

406
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
as you do.

407
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:19,240
This is what I guess 3.0 is going to be about blending things together that it's where

408
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,240
it wasn't possible before you don't talk about it.

409
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
It's really cool.

410
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,240
You know, my problem is something that I don't think you're going to be able to solve,

411
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,240
but I thought I'd just, if nobody else has said this, I thought I'd throw it out.

412
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,240
My problem is I listen to my iPod, and you know, in terms of what I think do this, we

413
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,240
can mute, and this will get this through.

414
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,240
So I'd love to have a stream of channels that the problem is is that I want somebody to manage

415
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
my iPod for you.

416
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,240
So when I, you know, listen to a series of shows, I want them not to necessarily disagree

417
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,240
from the iPod, but to, you know, something is going to be able to manage that list.

418
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,240
And I don't want to have to do it manually all the time.

419
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
That is directly what I have to do.

420
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,240
And that's why I shy away from the channel, I deal a little bit because it just means

421
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,240
more things where I have to go through and go, God, do I listen to that or not?

422
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
You know what I'm saying?

423
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,240
A lot of manual management, and unfortunately you have no control over that iPod

424
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
or any other device.

425
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:23,240
So we need to wait to the next generation or there's going to be a paradigm shift here or something.

426
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,240
Man, if you could make it so that like when I'm done,

427
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,240
when I press play in the iPod, I get the next show that I haven't listened to yet.

428
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,240
And when I think it doesn't change that,

429
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,240
I think that's where it's going.

430
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
That's the minimum where it's going.

431
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Of course, it's going to be more of a way to protect.

432
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,240
But I'm still going to check it out.

433
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,240
I still enjoy the idea of channels that those may be easier than I think.

434
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
Good work, man.

435
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,240
See it.

436
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,240
I think I understood what you asked.

437
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
And I think it kind of works that way.

438
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Now, this may be only with a new generation iPod.

439
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,240
In this case, I have the most latest iPod, which is of course,

440
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
is the iPhone.

441
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Let me tell you how I've set mine up.

442
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,240
And then you tell me if that's what you're talking about.

443
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,240
So in my iTunes, I'm subscribed to three channels.

444
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Let me just bring them up right now so I can tell you what they are.

445
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,240
So it's the Aviation Channel, which consists of a number of aviation shows.

446
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,240
It's a test channel called iPhone, which only has one show in it right now.

447
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,240
And then really, the most important show is the on the go show, which is all the short stuff

448
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,240
that I want to have loaded up to take with me on the train rise and just to be around

449
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,240
when I have a couple minutes to listen to something.

450
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
And it's a topical stuff as well.

451
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,240
So I've loaded those into iTunes.

452
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Now, when I put my, oh, I guess you have to actually put the iPod in order to bring up the settings.

453
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,240
So I think there's a, I think it's just a matter of settings, hold on one second.

454
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,240
I mean, I want you to hear the whole experience.

455
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Okay, so I'm plugging my iPhone into the, into the dock there.

456
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,240
You can hear my computer immediately recognize a device.

457
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Going, boom, boom.

458
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Of course, it still always brings up the this wizard.

459
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Welcome to the, to the found new hardware wizard.

460
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,240
This wizard helps you install software for digital still camera.

461
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,240
I don't know how to, it keeps popping up so I keep saying cancel.

462
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,240
All right, so it's now synchronizing.

463
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,240
And let me go to a podcast because there's a certain way can be handled.

464
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,240
Okay, so here are the options.

465
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
So you want to sync.

466
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,240
And then you can either select which, which podcast in this case three channels.

467
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,240
So aviation on the go and iPhone, I'll show up or all.

468
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,240
So for me, it's all podcasts, which is actually all channels.

469
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,240
And then I have options here to sync all one most recent three,

470
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,240
most recent five or ten all on played, all new blah, blah, blah.

471
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,240
So what I've done is I've selected all unplayed.

472
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,240
So what happens now is the pod show channel keeps loading stuff in.

473
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,240
It's a one way mechanism.

474
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,240
So it's, it's saying here's new stuff.

475
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,240
Here's new stuff and it's shoving it towards iTunes.

476
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,240
iTunes is is happily accepting that and downloading it.

477
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,240
But when I play something on the iPod or if I play it on iTunes and it's marked as played.

478
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,240
So it doesn't have a little blue ball next to it.

479
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,240
It then disappears from the iPod because it's set to sync all unplayed episodes.

480
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,240
So when you've played something, you hit next.

481
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Oh, go to the next one.

482
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,240
The next time you synchronize because of course that is kind of the crunch and all of this.

483
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,240
The ones you've listened to will go away.

484
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
So the system does work.

485
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,240
I think it solves exactly what you're talking about.

486
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:57,240
Now the next big trick of course for us is to create a widget that allows you to put your channels anywhere to play them out in a smooth experience.

487
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,240
And even better when you find something on the web and you want to add it to your channel.

488
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,240
That's when I wanted to be like a dragon dragon.

489
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm being on desert.

490
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
I'm just curious.

491
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:13,240
Is there any correlation between folder, scruncher, red bill and blue pill?

492
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Something to think about.

493
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
Hmm.

494
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Well, you think that scrunchers would have red tendencies and therefore red pill.

495
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,240
But I think it's folders and red pills for sure.

496
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
Scrunchers and blue pills.

497
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,240
Let's find out what a huge scruncher, folder, red pill or blue pill.

498
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Or you just joke college.

499
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,240
This guy's ripping up the scene and jersey.

500
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,240
To get the love.

501
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,240
We were swinging like a grape for much fun.

502
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,240
We made it that night and got it in a fight.

503
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Then my morning everything's alright.

504
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,240
I'm not much too touchy feeling stuck.

505
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,240
But we gotta get the love.

506
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
We all need the love.

00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,240
