7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You're a little bit of truck atomic at your years old.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This isn't Jack Rabbit. We're headed on down to DSC 595.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're ready, boys. It's football Friday. We got ourselves a con board.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
$60 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's twin' tight and I thought I had a football Friday match in my music.

Let's go home.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
$30 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It got me so long, my good time.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's better like a silver plane.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's time and I've been here long.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I've been here for so many days.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000

You're strong, you're strong

46
00:06:34,000 --> 00:07:03,440
Grandlatic smoke and mirrors I gotta tell you there's nothing like a big

47
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,640
barrel of over-modulated sound on a Friday that makes me feel better than anything.

48
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,720
Of course it's almost Monday now in Australia. I'm so sorry I'm late bringing you today's

49
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,760
a maximum music football Friday episode. Everything went wrong today. I thought I was

50
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,720
going to be ready to record the show at 9 o'clock. The electrician shows up at 9

51
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,120
the housekeepers here. I got to get to the city because I had a very important meeting

52
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:42,200
comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip yeah that's right that's

53
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,740
because I had a meeting with comic strip blogger at the UK crash pad at the

54
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,680
shortage office in London. I must say a meeting like I've had no other meetings.

55
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,000
We sound for about three hours. Hey I let me tell you something right off the

56
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,760
comic strip blogger is not a bad looking guy. He even showed me in fact he showed me quite

57
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,600
proudly. He showed me his driver's license and he said look this was me without

58
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,360
all the weight and he's not a bad looking guy. I was there with Lydia and with the

59
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,400
carry in the office and man it was so funny because exactly the way he is on the

60
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,920
show that's the way he is in person you know. He even had a PowerPoint presentation

61
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,480
which is so awesome. I should actually ask him if I can publish that because it is a

62
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,960
true work of art. He said some really smart things about what Pod Show should and shouldn't

63
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:39,960
be doing in mobile and in mobility. I think was his word and you know basically like we're

64
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:47,400
lazy. We're insufficient. No good. The presentation had it like beautiful. It was

65
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,480
beautifully put together like fuck you Adam Curry. It was just I was completely blown away by it.

66
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,000
And even though I don't know if we can and you know philosophically we agree and we disagree on

67
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,400
some things. He interviewed me for a long time and I'm sure he's going to put that up at

68
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,000
comic strip blog.com but boy oh boy did it food bar the rest of my day because I didn't get back

69
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,880
until let's see almost seven yeah the trainer arrived at 705 so yeah I got to feed the animals

70
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,240
and Christina's like off to some gig and yeah oh man the perils of a parent alone I tell you.

71
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,960
But I hope you saw Curry dot com you saw the lady Patricia's spectacular performance last night

72
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,280
on one of the top talk shows in the Netherlands. Of course you couldn't understand any of what she

73
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,280
was saying anything that she was saying but just look at that entrance man. Just look at how she

74
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:45,400
she came on stage it was fabulous so can't wait to go Sunday to see the show dancing with the stars

75
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,760
in the Netherlands. Hey a lot of emails been coming in throughout the week now that we're no longer

76
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,520
a simul podcasting on serious sidelight radio. A lot of folks want to know what's going on

77
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,680
with our very own satellite repairman PW Fenton and well you know I figured I could tell you

78
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,720
but then again maybe just pose the question directly to the man that would be uh much easier perhaps

79
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,080
Peter. I hope you can hear me okay this is Peter. I know you're getting lots of questions about

80
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,720
what happened to me you know now that I open clothes the satellite window anymore. I know some

81
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,960
people think I've been fired but I just want your listeners to know that you and Ron have been

82
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,360
very gracious to give me the chance to stay employed. As you know I've taken over the pledge to

83
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,680
T-shirts shop and I think I'm getting the hang of it. I could put out several hundred T-shirts

84
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:47,480
today and when my left hand heals I'll probably wait a second I got to start this on the back.

85
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:57,080
Uh yeah when when my left hand heals I can I can take this bandage off and I'll be able to

86
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:04,280
make a few thousand shirts a day so it's not as glamorous as the satellite was but it's worked

87
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:11,640
and I appreciate you and Ron keeping me on. Have a good time with the charge. Oh and for the

88
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,160
time being you know what with the hand and all I've had to switch to scrunching.

89
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:49,160
But it's gonna be just fine. It's gonna be just like it's a meeting maybe what you got to do

90
00:11:49,160 --> 00:12:10,760
I want to be just like you. I want to be taking the truth. 10 down the walls and something

91
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,720
Yeah, I'm digging you. I'm digging you. I'm digging you.

93
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:34,760
You know how I talk about the soundtrack to our live. This is a pre-mo example. How in years from now, you'll hear this song. You think, oh, yeah. I remember that was when all the dig users played the song.

94
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:45,760
Oh, yeah. I remember that was when all the dig users put that illegal crack code up on dig.com and then Jeff Smith made a song about it.

95
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,760
And then Kelly Lewis did a video about it. Oh, yes. In that nice.

96
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:58,760
We're building our own soundtrack to our own lives right here before you're very eyes happening on a football Friday with maximum music and that's some crappy promos.

97
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,760
Let's take the mid-a-tarsal. I'll go with the cervical.

98
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:09,760
I'll take the mandible. I'll take the scapula. I'm going to say B, New York Stock Exchange. I think that was Paul Young.

99
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,760
Let's take the fibula. Oh, I'm going to go for the pelvis like Elvis.

100
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
I'm going to say B, 25.

101
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Check out what happens when Natalie Delcante and share from rock and roll TV come to Johnny Todd's house.

102
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,760
I think they're nasty. I'm going to say gonorrhea.

103
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,760
You're playing with it the long got thought you're not coming.

104
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,760
You're out there. I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

105
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,760
You're out there. Please don't bang back yet.

106
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,760
Do see John Joe.

107
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Todd made a quick update job, baby.

108
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Do see Todd.

109
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Do see Todd. Do see Todd. Do see Todd. Here for you.

110
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Yo. What's up, Adam?

111
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Do you see Todd? The official musicologist of the Chacha.

112
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Dude, what a week it's been here at the Deli Source Code.

113
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Oh, my lord, there's been so much going on.

114
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,760
And I got to play something on a full bar Friday that I'm absolutely thoroughly excited to play for you.

115
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,760
I found these guys out on my space a couple weeks ago and I sent them an email and you got to be on the positive music network.

116
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,760
And they said, nah, you know, it didn't work out for us.

117
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,760
We couldn't get a confirmation email. There was all this kind of controversy.

118
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
I don't know. I didn't get it all.

119
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,760
But I said, dude, you got to get up on the PMN.

120
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,760
I'll play you on the Deli Source Code. How about that?

121
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,760
And I'm really, really psyched because I think you're going to love this song.

122
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,760
The band is called the brown horn that's out of Ontario, Canada.

123
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,760
And it's kind of like this black crow's meets a cdc kind of sound.

124
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
I don't know. I just like it a lot.

125
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,760
Check this out. The song is rooftop sniper by the band.

126
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,760
The brown horn is on a vubar freaking Friday.

127
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
Check this out.

128
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,760
She snuck through the alley and dropped the bells and do her good girl.

129
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:39,760
She rocked a button, blocked us like green, coming off of everything.

130
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,760
She's alive.

131
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,760
Find another.

132
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,760
She moves in for the kill.

133
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,760
To back aim us and walk through.

134
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,760
I see it out, out now.

135
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Oh, it's out, out, out now.

136
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:09,760
She's a bumpköprice sniper, ignite sniper, fire gun.

137
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:17,760
She's shocked.

138
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,960
She's sup they're cated into thanks

139
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,760
towards the dark.

140
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,760
A funiless guy.

141
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,760
It's a new era for the tale

142
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,760
To pack my life and all the deal

143
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,760
This is how all night goes

144
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,760
And I'll know about my heart

145
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,760
To get a half-form of needles in the shop

146
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
I'll find you out

147
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,760
To get a half-form of needles in the shop

148
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,760
So I'll have to go through the work

149
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,760
So I'll have to take out a half-form of needles

150
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,760
And I'll know about my heart

151
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,760
To take my life and all the deal

152
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,760
And still I'll know about my heart

153
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:45,720
Oh yeah, see, that's what I'm talking about.

154
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,160
Surgeersy Todd, music colleges of the Charlie comes through once again with a brown hornet

155
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,160
son of Maximum Music, who are Friday.

156
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Damn.

157
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,160
Ah, there's all kinds of football stuff in the world.

158
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:07,160
What's up now?

159
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Hey Adam, how's it going?

160
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,640
This is the shit, that's the wrong guy, here we go.

161
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,840
Hi Adam, it's a prolific program in the game from San Francisco, but had two things,

162
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,960
number one, it was due several, the few we discussed the last seven, and because

163
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,720
the pluralized address to you, they savant, but up to you.

164
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Okay, thank you very much.

165
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,840
There's a story on the BBC about a Boeing 737 stuck in a city road Mumbai India, apparently

166
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,480
the driver was driving it to the city at the weekend when the driver got lost and abandoned

167
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
the plane.

168
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,200
I'm including a link to a story in my email, take a look at it and if you'd like, say

169
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
next show.

170
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Cheers.

171
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,200
Cheers to you prolific program, awesome story, great pictures, it is weird.

172
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:04,040
His guy just dumped a few dislodges of a Boeing 737 on his flatbed truck right in the

173
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,600
smack in the middle of Mumbai, a prolific program, what would I do without you in the

174
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
rest of the savants?

175
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,920
I would be nowhere.

176
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:28,440
So as with most of what we play here on the Chacha, it's all part safe, of course, Venus

177
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,760
from Shocking Blue, I had to get special permission to play that.

178
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,800
But every Friday, I also want to roll out the first gen high pod, we all have one like it,

179
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,160
it's one of those really thick ones, you could put that many songs on it and you kind

180
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,560
of filled it up with all your favorite tracks, maybe from your Napster days, perhaps

181
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:49,720
you ripped off all of your CV, ripped off, you ripped all of your CDs, in order to get

182
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,040
all your favorite tracks out of, maybe you just like, some schmucks like me, went over

183
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,200
and you bought all these favorite songs of the iTunes music store and it happens anyway.

184
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,320
You're never gonna, you're gonna archive it, you're gonna keep it on the device, right?

185
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,240
So I've got my first gen high pod right here on the monitor, now what we do is we just

186
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,360
put it on random and hit play and see what comes up.

187
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,800
I gotta tell you, I'm cheating a little bit, because I do have a playlist called Friday,

188
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:20,760
so let me just see what comes up when I, yeah, oh, yeah, baby, it's got to give you a

189
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,800
smile, doesn't it?

190
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,800
I'm sorry, I just have to break the lawn, play this entire track, it just sounds too good

191
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,160
and reminds me of my youth at the 80s with the cure of Friday, I'm in love.

192
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:54,320
I don't care if I'm next to you, you say it's great and when I say to you, I don't care

193
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:04,040
about you, it's private, I'm in love, I'm there, you can't fall apart, you say when

194
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:13,280
I say break my lawn, all Thursday, doesn't mean you start this Friday, I'm in love,

195
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:23,960
Saturday, I'm in love, Sunday, I'm always concerned, Friday, I'm in heaven, heaven, heaven,

196
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:32,360
I don't care if I'm next to you, you say when I say hard to tell, Thursday, I'm never

197
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:56,840
looking back, it's private, I'm in love, I'm there, you can't fall to me, you say when

198
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:07,880
I say in bed, I'm thirsty, watch the walls instead, it's private, I'm in love, Saturday,

199
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:16,760
I'm in love, Sunday, I'm always concerned, Friday, I'm in heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven,

200
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:32,800
I'm in love, Sunday, I'm in love, Sunday, I'm in love, Sunday, I'm in love, Sunday, I'm in love,

201
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Sunday, I'm in love, Sunday, I'm in love, Sunday, I'm in love, Sunday, I'm in love, Sunday, I'm in love,

202
00:23:42,040 --> 00:24:04,960
Friday, I'm in love, Sunday, I'm in love, Sunday, I'm in love, Sunday, I'm in love, Friday,

203
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:15,960
My daughter still listens to the cure, how awesome of that.

204
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Friday I'm in love, from Adam's first gen I pot, and of course you heard my pilot

205
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,960
earlier I played the wrong feedback.

206
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Now it comes from a guy who we know as a podcast listener.

207
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,960
I think we should bring him into the circle, disavone, and just call him the pissed off podcast listener,

208
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,960
or maybe the angry podcast listeners, specials.

209
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Okay, it's a time for our Savand from our series of The Circle of Savand.

210
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,960
I'm the Sultan of Savand, Savand.

211
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,960
I think I'm going to be able to get at least once a month and episode.

212
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:03,960
And I hope to be able to talk to a Savand every single day.

213
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,960
And by the way, I want you to know that this format change doesn't mean that I don't

214
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,960
want to make a picture, make a picture by the Sultan of Savand.

215
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
Adam, how's it going?

216
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,960
This is the Cha Cha listener, podcaster, whatever you want to call me.

217
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,960
Yeah, we'll fuck you for cutting me off last time.

218
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Even though I guess I understand your frustration, you were having with your computer,

219
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,960
while I went on with my sorry-ass comment.

220
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
So I guess it's fuck me.

221
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
Fuck you.

222
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Whatever.

223
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
You know what?

224
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
I'm over it.

225
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
But hey, listen.

226
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Here's what I wanted to ask you.

227
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Mr. Potter, father of the podis fear.

228
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Oh great, Sultan of the Savand.

229
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,960
Should we worry about the ruling by the CRB?

230
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,960
I mean, thanks for having Brian longest, on episode 592,

231
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,960
explaining the statutory license for streaming web radio.

232
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,960
But out of that Savand segment, I understood that all music, not just streaming,

233
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
is threatened by this ruling.

234
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Is that so?

235
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,960
If it is, then perhaps we should make a calling to all podcasts listeners and podcasts

236
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,960
to unite again on a boom rush to charts.

237
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Yeah, I know.

238
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
You don't want to use podcasts.

239
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,960
He knows the medium for social movement.

240
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Come on.

241
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,960
After all you've done for music and podcasts, which, I mean, I thank you.

242
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
I never mind talking to you, Dan.

243
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,960
But I thank you just like Lisa from Orlando on episode 594.

244
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,960
I appreciate all you've done with podcasts in general.

245
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,960
So shouldn't we stand up and be heard once again?

246
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,960
Shouldn't we stand together, support HR-2060?

247
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,960
You know, the Internet Radio Collective Act introduced by two representatives,

248
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
the House of Congress?

249
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Shouldn't we read up on Savandetradio.org and help save Internet radio?

250
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,960
You tell us, oh, great one.

251
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,960
What should we do?

252
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Yeah, well, thanks for listening, fucker.

253
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
And yes, bolder.

254
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Actually, double-folder to be precise.

255
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
Hey, man, let's say, listen to me now.

256
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,960
All right.

257
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
You clearly didn't listen to the advice.

258
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
I got two lawyers on the show for you.

259
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,960
You didn't listen to what they had to say.

260
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,960
It was very clear that you can give anyone a special license or special permission.

261
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,960
And the only thing that would have to come into play is actually obtaining that piece,

262
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,960
which is not that hard because you can just make it an opt-in when you sign up.

263
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Like, oh, gee, what a where does that happen?

264
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Oh, the pod save music network.

265
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
Now that bill is very fine.

266
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,960
All that bill does is reduces the price.

267
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,960
And it proposes new pricing.

268
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,960
And that's nothing to do with the statutory license.

269
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,960
We're way behind the eight ball on that.

270
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,960
That was put in place with the first time the copyright royalty board came around.

271
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
No, no, no.

272
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,960
And by the way, I love using pod casting for social movement.

273
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,960
I never said that I didn't want to do that.

274
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,960
I may not want to do it through my show in particular,

275
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,960
but it's a fantastic mechanism.

276
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,960
And by the way, who's doing a really good job at that,

277
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,960
please point me to shows that are really making a difference

278
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,960
through political movements.

279
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
It's Foo Barman, my brain's hurt.

280
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
And I can't think about that.

281
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Hey, hey, hey!

282
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Hey, hey, hey!

283
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Yeah, I love the sing along.

284
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,960
My life of ways to win.

285
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,960
My life of ways to win.

286
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,960
And a man in blue, her name.

287
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,960
And a man in blue, well they're good.

288
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
So I got a job for you.

289
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,960
So I got a job for you.

290
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,960
You want the greatest combat man, won't you come to play?

291
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,960
I can't get a focus now, there's no one else in the play

292
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,960
He wants a job, man, and it's a prayer

293
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,960
But then his number came up, and he was gone with his breath

294
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
He's in the only now, I'm going round the lead

295
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,960
He's a boozy, who could give a boy company beat

296
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:29,960
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I

297
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:47,540
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do,, I do, I do,, I do I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do I do, I do, I do, I go, I do, much

298
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Okay guys, grab your gal and hit the floor because he's that big human waiting to swim too

299
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Along the bedding with the beautiful eyes, I want to be with my client's eyes

300
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,960
I just found a baby once saying to me, yeah, hope it's down to baby

301
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
I want to ring you for me, yeah, hope it's down to baby, I want to ring you for me

302
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,920
I want to do already, baby, what am I gonna do?

303
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,960
I'm gonna do the movie, yeah, hope it's down to baby

304
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,960
I want to ring you, hope it's down to baby

305
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,960
I want to ring you for me, yeah, hope it's down to baby

306
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,560

00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,660
You know, man, you're so kind

327
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,160
You know, man, you're so kind

328
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
You know, man, you're so kind

329
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,160
You know, man, you're so kind

330
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,760
You know, man, you're so kind

331

335
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
You know, man, you're so kind

336
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:32,760
Some place where you don't like

337
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,360
You know, man, you're so kind

338
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:45,360
You're gonna cry until I've never loved, so I'm gonna try to move a true bond to the truth of me all.

339
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Now the lady P and the star sisters.

340
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Are you able to see that performed live on Dancing With The Stars?

341
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,360
Sunday evening, I think it's like a 8 o'clock on RTL4 if you happen to live in the Netherlands.

342
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,360
I'm sure it'll be on YouTube within a few hours.

343
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,360
It was so cool yesterday I knew that Patricia had done this talk show and I couldn't see it.

344
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:16,360
Because we don't receive the station over here and one of her super fan.

345
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,360
I think super fan Rick had put the interview up in two parts on YouTube, fantastic.

346
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,360
I love it when YouTube works by ripping off content in my favor.

347
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,360
That's when I really love that stuff.

348
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
I had MTA for a few days ago.

349
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,360
You were just rock man.

350
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,360
Just put my way back to Brussels.

351
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,360
It's 18 evening, just got out of a traffic jam.

352
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,360
And catching up on your shows because it did some traveling.

353
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
And what do I hear?

354
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
Made our love.

355
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,360
Man, that is good stuff.

356
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,360
I think I even had it probably get a ticket in the middle.

357
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,360
But luckily in Belgium we just paid him to get it over with.

358
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
But it was well worth it.

359
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Thanks man.

360
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
And keep up the good work.

361
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
I love the shows with the salon.

362
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
Bye.

363
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,360

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360

And I was my brother, I lost my lover, the friend I'll see, I'm still in love

417
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,960
You can lie to yourself, and you can waste away, you can die alone

418
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,960
I'm just a one thing that's here, I'm almost lost, I'm lying right

I love to fight, don't listen to me about it, cause I'm always right

Tell your brother, do you?

429
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,960
Like a child from the world

430
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
I'm so scared

431
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,960

00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
13,000

475
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,960
Quivering

476
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Nevermind

477
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,960
Yeah, it's almost like a

478
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,960
What do they call it?

479
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,960
Like a walkathon

480
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,960
A lot more fun and a lot more exhausting

481
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Through individual sponsorships

482
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
Participants generate revenue in this live group event

483
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,960
For every minute they masturbate

484
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,960
Or for each orgasm claimed

485
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
And they raise money for a good cause, obviously

486
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Well, that's just nasty

487
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
What do I get there today?

488
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
It's Friday

489
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
It's Friday

490
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
I have a spinal fund

491
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
Well winding it down, I got to tell you

492
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
And I know I've talked about this before

493
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,960
And I've said it before, but I don't think you can say it enough

494
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,960
Since I've been with my wife for 20 years now

495
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,960
It's one thing to be in San Francisco for a week

496
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
And to miss her

497
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
And to not have her around

498
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
Really have her to talk to

499
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,960
I have to admit that's what we enjoy doing most

500
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
It's talking and laughing and having a fun

501
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,960
But when she is off

502
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
And of course I want her to do all of

503
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Anything she wants to do

504
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
It's all her creative

505
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
Juices that are flowing

506
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,960
And she's a good pointer life to be doing something cool

507
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
Of course she's been away for a week

508
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
That was really bad, you know, because I got teenager

509
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
I got the cats, I got the dog

510
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
And then as I said, you know, it's like

511
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
All the stuff that just kind of happens around me

512
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,960
That I have to admit I take for granted, you know, even food

513
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
The simple essentials in life

514
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,960
So, you know, why don't you send your significant

515
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
Other, your partner, your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife

516
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
Whatever, send him away for a week

517
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,960
Send him away, let them do something entirely

518
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
That they love to do

519
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
Having a call only once a day

520
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,960
I'm just trying to get the experiment the same as ours

521
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,960
And then you will see how much you appreciate what they do

522
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,960
It's all those things you just completely forget about

523
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
So let's all think about our significant others

524
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,960
Shall we?

525
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,960
Because you know when you're going to the weekend with a smile

526
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,960
It's just the best medicine

527
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,960
Okay, why don't we just metal the mood a little bit

528
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,960
So we can float happily into our Saturdays and Sundays

529
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,960
With Stephanie Hardger, the very thought of you

530
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
It's just the fight of you

531
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,960
And I before get to do

532
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,960
And those old and narrow things

533
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,960
That anyone ought to do

534
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,960
I'm living in a kind of daydream

535
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,960
I'm happy as a queen

536
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,960
And foolish

537
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,960
Though it may seem

538
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,960
To me that's everything

539
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,960
The mirror I do of you

540
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,960
The longing here for you

541
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:06,960
You'll never know how slow the moments go

542
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,960
Till I'm near to you

543
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,960
I see your face

544
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
And every flower

545
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,960
Your eyes and stars above

546
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,960
It's just the thought of you

547
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,960
My love

548
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:12,960
It's just the thought of you

549
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,960
And I before get to do

550
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,960
Those little ordinary things

551
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,960
That anyone ought to do

552
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,960
I'm living in a kind of daydream

553
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,960
I'm happy as a queen

554
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,960
And foolish though it may seem

555
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,960
To me that's everything

556
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,960
The mirror I do of you

557
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,960
The longing here for you

558
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,960
You'll never know how slow the moments go

559
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,960
Till I'm near to you

560
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,960
I see your face and every flower

561
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,960
Your eyes and stars above

562
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,960
It's just the thought of you

563
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,960
The very thought of you

564
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,960
My love

565
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,960
All right, go ahead

566
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,960
It's just the thought of you

567
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
The very thought of you

568
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,960
My love

569
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,960
Whoever it is

570
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
Give them a hug

571
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,960
Give them a sweet

572
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,960
Have a dance around the room for Christ's sake

573
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,960
Enjoy life

574
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,960
