4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Atom Curry was just a guy with big hair who sold his first company and thought he'd just kick back and take it easy.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But he never counted on this.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Adam and Patricia, the king and queen of the matter, or just the lady and the tramp.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Only on the daily source code.

Stink his Adam Curry.

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Like these roses we all feed.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm counting with yours.

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Must in the music.

14

All in foolishness.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
All on us.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
To be none of control.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Must in the music.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In the music.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Better baby please don't cry.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Wipe the guilt out from your eyes.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Me conscious on the bed.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
To no one in a city.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In the mirror you're perfect.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Plastic flowers never fade.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We all turn the gray.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We're captain of course.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
On the free way below.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Must in the music.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
All in foolishness.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
All on us.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To be none of control.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Must in the music.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
In the music.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In the music.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:46,000
In the others we all are still.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Must in the music.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Baby, please don't cry

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why the guilt out from your eyes?

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Make yourself up off the bed

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So I won't ever send you

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thought it's glistening and they shine

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Love you, baby, please don't cry

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why the guilt out from your eyes?

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Make yourself up off the bed

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So I won't ever send you

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thought it's glistening and they shine

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Love you, baby, please don't cry

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why the guilt out from your eyes?

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Make yourself up off the bed

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So I won't never send you

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Thought it's glistening and they shine

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Love you, baby, please don't cry

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Why the guilt out from your eyes?

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Make yourself up off the bed

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So I won't ever send you

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thought it's glistening and they shine

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Love you, baby, please don't cry

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why the guilt out from your eyes

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Make yourself up off the bed

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So I won't ever send you

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Thought it's glistening and they shine

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Love you, baby, please don't cry

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:20,400
Just when you think it's prints, it turns into something else, it's David Usher, the music.

64
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,900
Every time some atoms all alone, any needs is love right there on the microphone.

65
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,900
So here she is, yes, the lady Patricia.

66
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:44,400
They say to have some better than one, and with this angel from above, there's nothing that they both can't do.

67
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Let me make you wildest dreams come true, to grab your ear buds and jam them in.

68
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,400
And let the fabulous show begin.

69
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,400
It's Adam and Patricia.

70
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Adam and Patricia.

71
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Special Sunday edition of the Daily Source Code.

72
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,400
And we do indeed welcome the lady Patricia.

73
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Oh, thank you.

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
I'm so happy you're here, baby.

75
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Long time, long time since you've been on the show.

76
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,400
It's been at least been too long, dog.

77
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
Yes, it has.

78
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,400
The noise you hear in the background is the fan.

79
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Right in dog.

80
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400
And the fan is running at high high speed.

81
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Not the dog, the cat.

82
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
No, I can hear the dog barking.

83
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Oh, really? Why is he barking?

84
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Why is he barking?

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
I don't know.

86
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Maybe somebody wants to come in.

87
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
He can't come in himself.

88
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
No, somebody else.

89
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Oh, someone out well, tough luck.

90
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
They can't.

91
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
That's going to annoy the shit out of me.

92
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Do you want to have a look?

93
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
No, no.

94
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
We're just getting the show underway.

95
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
When I play the next song, you can go have a look.

96
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
All right.

97
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,400
So we are back from the love island.

98
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
From love island.

99
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Indeed.

100
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,400
We didn't talk about this since you haven't been on the show.

101
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
We were on the fire island.

102
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
No, you didn't tell anybody anything.

103
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,400
It's not like everybody doesn't know about fire island.

104
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Oh.

105
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Is it famous?

106
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Oh, yeah.

107
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Oh, I didn't.

108
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
In from London, from Europe.

109
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Not in Europe.

110
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
No.

111
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
And I'm quite dismayed.

112
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
You're telling all your gay boy friends about this, because I want to keep

113
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
this.

114
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
I'm special to ourselves.

115
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
I don't want to overrun with Dutchies.

116
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Yeah.

117
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
But so.

118
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
What do you say?

119
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
So everybody knows it already.

120
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
No, in America.

121
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Everybody knows it.

122
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
In America.

123
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
You know, land of the free in the straight.

124
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
In a America.

125
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Yeah.

126
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,400
So, what did you think of our island retreat?

127
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Fire.

128
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
It was wonderful.

129
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Yeah.

130
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
If the world was like that.

131
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Everybody hugging and kissing and giggling and, you know, being nice to each other.

132
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
That is true.

133
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
It wasn't.

134
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
It was wonderful.

135
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,400
For all the, uh, for all the testosterone on that island, it was very, very

136
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
laid out.

137
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Very relaxed.

138
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Very relaxed.

139
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Everybody was nice, friendly.

140
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,400
It was like, you, the minute you got off the, the ferry boat.

141
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
And I don't use that word lightly.

142
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Very boat.

143
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Very boat.

144
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Yeah.

145
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:14,400
It's like everyone has dropped away all of their anger, all of their, I mean, I

146
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
didn't even see any hissy fits.

147
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
No.

148
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Nothing.

149
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Nothing.

150
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
No one was getting angry.

151
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
No one.

152
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
You look wonderful.

153
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Yeah.

154
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
You must be new to the island.

155
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Hmm.

156
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Oh, I'm having an overload of co-tour.

157
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Yes.

158
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
That's it.

159
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
No.

160
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
One of the dogs started to bark.

161
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
And that's what he said.

162
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
I think he had an overload of co-tour.

163
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Yeah.

164
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
He was looking at you.

165
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
That was Christina and me.

166
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
What are dogs?

167
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
You're head phones a little bit too loud.

168
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Is that you?

169
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Maybe they're leaking.

170
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Yeah.

171
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Whoa.

172
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Oh, don't do that.

173
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Oh, boy.

174
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
No, no, no.

175
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I'll close your mic for a second.

176
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Maybe it was leaking a little bit.

177
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Just a little bit.

178
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
With my little.

179
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Little moody gush.

180
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
No ears.

181
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
So in all, despite the fact that we had shitty weather, we had a pretty

182
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
good time.

183
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Yeah.

184
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
You know, had my sister there and her two kids.

185
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
They were delightful.

186
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Very funny kids.

187
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Very, yeah.

188
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Extremely funny.

189
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Yeah.

190
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
You can tell that there's a committee in the family there.

191
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Lots of humor.

192
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Yeah.

193
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Especially the boy.

194
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I just, I don't love with him.

195
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Yeah.

196
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Oh, really?

197
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Yeah.

198
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
He was in love with Christina.

199
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Oh, yeah.

200
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Definitely.

201
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
He couldn't wait to snuggle up next to her watching your high school

202
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
school too.

203
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Yeah.

204
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Oh, man.

205
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
They loved it.

206
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,400
I think that it, um, with the weather as bad as it was.

207
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
I think having the kids around on my sister made it better.

208
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Yeah, well, and what you do when the weather is bad, you actually come together

209
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,400
and sit down have a nice cup of tea and we did some scrabble.

210
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Yeah.

211
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
We did scrabble.

212
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Yeah.

213
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
You won the first, uh, the first game.

214
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
That was my first scrabble.

215
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Yeah.

216
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Well, that was great.

217
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Especially in English.

218
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Yeah.

219
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
You kicked ass.

220
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Didn't I?

221
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
Oh, yeah.

222
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Yeah.

223
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
You didn't believe it, did you?

224
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
No, no.

225
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
I, I perfectly well believed that you could do that.

226
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Christina was the one who was going to...

227
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Yeah, right, Mom.

228
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Yeah.

229
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
She showed her right.

230
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Yeah.

231
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Our daughter, by the way, who was, uh, who turns, uh, 17 tomorrow.

232
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Mm.

233
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Okay.

234
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Believe it.

235
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Yeah.

236
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
You remember 17 years ago?

237
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
I mean, I can't believe it, but yeah.

238
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Yeah.

239
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Yeah.

240
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
That's pretty amazing.

241
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Yeah.

242
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
And she's, uh, now she...

243
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
And that's quite a woman.

244
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
I wasn't a woman like she is right now.

245
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
What do you mean?

246
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
When I was 17.

247
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
What do you mean?

248
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
A woman like she is.

249
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Well, she looks so much like an fool.

250
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Oh, yeah.

251
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Yeah.

252
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
What do you mean?

253
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Well, she's a total...

254
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Carbon copy of you.

255
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,400
No, but I didn't look like that.

256
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
I didn't...

257
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
No, no, but she's a carbon copy of you now.

258
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
No, yeah.

259
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Yeah.

260
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
And I was 17.

261
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
I was very...

262
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
I had no hips, no breasts.

263
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
You know?

264
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Oh, okay.

265
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
She beats you on those two.

266
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Well, that's what I mean.

267
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Yeah.

268
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Yeah.

269
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
And she's a, uh, she and, uh, jaker off to the get-loaded festival.

270
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Yeah.

271
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
What's that?

272
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
The...

273
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
I was a parent.

274
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
It doesn't sound good.

275
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
It doesn't.

276
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
It doesn't sound good.

277
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
It doesn't sound good.

278
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
You just don't want them to get loaded festival.

279
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Only English people can come up with.

280
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Exactly right.

281
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,400
You know, and by the way, um, you know, there's a lot going on right now in the UK.

282
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,400
The news is completely blanketed about this kid, Reese.

283
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Really sad story.

284
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
He was shot and killed.

285
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,400
And, uh, believe it was up in Liverpool.

286
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Yeah.

287
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
On a parking lot.

288
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Yeah, yeah.

289
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
But he was...

290
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Yeah.

291
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Right.

292
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,400
So another kid on a bike on a BMX bike, uh, shot him to death.

293
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Well, they don't know yet who it was.

294
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Well, no, but they know that it was another kid.

295
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
It probably wasn't a kid.

296
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
They have a CCTV footage.

297
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
It's just they can't really make out who it is.

298
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
But they can see it was another kid.

299
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
They don't know which kid it was.

300
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
And so the UK is freaking out.

301
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
And, you know, this is the top of the news.

302
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
It's all that everyone's talking about.

303
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,400
And I'm like, you know, how hard can this be?

304
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
You know, it's really easy to see why.

305
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
And it's really easy to fix it.

306
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,400
See, now that always confuses me because if I watch a CSI, everything is so easy.

307
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
So easy to find out who it was.

308
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
So easy.

309
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
See all the whoops, whoops on the internet.

310
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Whoops.

311
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
They found it.

312
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Whoops.

313
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
They do this.

314
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
And this is, of course, what we as a people expect.

315
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
So this is why the news keeps on dragging it out.

316
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Yeah.

317
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
And they're just going to keep on dragging this out.

318
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
And now it's like this huge political thing.

319
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
And, you know, we've got gangs.

320
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
And now, of course, the music industry is responsible for it.

321
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
And the video game industry is responsible for it.

322
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
And I'm telling you, the kids that do this.

323
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Who form these gangs are kids from, I would say, middle to upper middle class families,

324
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
broken homes, no doubt about it.

325
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Huge problem here in the UK with parents divorcing and not giving a shit about their lives.

326
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Well, almost every friend from Christina.

327
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Well, I don't want to say, these kids are bored.

328
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
They have nothing better to do.

329
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
They're not poor.

330
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
They're not.

331
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
They have homes.

332
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
They have places.

333
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
I know they're bored.

334
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
They're bored to death.

335
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
And they're not being looked after by their families, by their parents.

336
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Completely left alone.

337
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
We can't, how many kids a week do it do I have here?

338
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
That's what I mean.

339
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,400
From, from broken homes, all my dad doesn't give a shit of a mom doesn't give a shit.

340
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
A friend of Christina, just a friend.

341
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,400
And they, they, they, the, two of them fell in the mud, you know.

342
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Just a friend.

343
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Just a friend.

344
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Just a friend.

345
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
They fell in the mud.

346
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Yeah, you know, he gave her a piggyback ride.

347
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
They were laughing.

348
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
And I know what.

349
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
But they fell in the mud.

350
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,400
And he shared with, covered with,

351
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
And he said, I just bought it.

352
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
And, you know, he had to work really hard for it.

353
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
So I tried to get it out.

354
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
This is Josh.

355
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Yes.

356
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
What does Josh do?

357
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
What kind of jobs, yeah?

358
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
No.

359
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
He goes to school, right?

360
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
That's not what I wanted to say.

361
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I know.

362
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
But I'm just being a kid.

363
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
And I said to him, you know what?

364
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Ask your mom to spray some, uh, vanish on it.

365
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Yeah.

366
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Just leave it.

367
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
He said, my mom, my mom is not even there.

368
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
I always do their laundry.

369
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Uh.

370
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Because my mom lives with his dead.

371
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
So that's, you know, and every week,

372
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
there's somebody here in the house.

373
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
And I say, what time are you going to have dinner?

374
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
And home?

375
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
And home?

376
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Nobody's having dinner for me.

377
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,400
So I might as well take them all in here.

378
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
And cook for them.

379
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
And click.

380
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Because nobody has a normal family.

381
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
That's what I want to say.

382
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
There is no, there's no sit down dinner.

383
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
There are no dinners at all.

384
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
I always tell my say, ask your mom.

385
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
My mom doesn't live with me.

386
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
So, and I think that's the problem the UK has.

387
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Just as an outsider looking in.

388
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
That's what I see.

389
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
That's a, you know, and we live in a very middle,

390
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,400
up, middle, middle, middle, middle class place.

391
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Yeah.

392
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
And you can tell.

393
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
These kids are just bored.

394
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
They get nothing better to do.

395
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
There's nothing at home.

396
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
There's no one waiting.

397
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
There's no one looking after him.

398
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
There's no love flowing.

399
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
That's why they're here.

400
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Yeah.

401
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
They want my hugs.

402
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Yeah.

403
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
And they wanted to play with my shot.

404
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
My food.

405
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
My food.

406
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Well, yes, that they had my food dear.

407
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Let's be honest.

408
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Yeah.

409
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
It was, uh, I took take away.

410
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,400
I slaved over that over the co-punk chicken.

411
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
But yeah, it's true.

412
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
So, do you want to go check on the dog?

413
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
He stopped barking, so maybe.

414
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Maybe it's okay.

415
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Yeah.

416
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Are you listening to the music thinking?

417
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
What the hell was he playing?

418
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Yeah.

419
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Yeah.

420
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
It's a mashup.

421
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Eight out of better known as Dr. Art 7 over.

422
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
You recognize arrows, man.

423
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Yeah.

424
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
So, we should kiss.

425
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:23,400
There's all you really, really want to kiss your eyes.

426
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Something special about you.

427
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
I must feel it's like you.

428
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,400
It's not a lot of guys don't work my time.

429
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

430
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
It's getting kind of crazy.

431
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Because you want to take it over my mind.

432
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,400
And it feels like you.

433
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
But you don't know why.

434
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Yeah.

435
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
That's where.

436
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
It feels like you.

437
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Ooh.

438
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
You don't know my name.

439
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Round and round we go.

440
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Will you ever know?

441
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Oh.

442
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Oh.

443
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Oh.

444
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Oh.

445
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Oh.

446
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Oh.

447
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Oh.

448
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Oh.

449
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Oh.

450
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Oh.

451
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Oh.

452
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Oh.

453
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Oh.

454
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Oh.

455
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Oh.

456
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
We live in a baby.

457
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Yes.

458
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Yes.

459
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Yes.

460
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
We live in a baby.

461
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Yes.

462
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
We live in a baby.

463
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,400
And it feels like you.

464
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Oh, you don't know.

465
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
But you don't know.

466
00:15:47,400 --> 00:16:00,260
Another

467
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,260
You're my favorite

468
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,260
You're my favorite

469
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,260
You're no one

470
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,260
You're my love

471
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,260
Ah, I see

472
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,260
I don't even know what you're doing

473
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,260
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine

474
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,260
I'm fine, I'm fine

475
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,260
I'm fine, I'm fine

476
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,260
I'm fine, I'm fine

477
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,260
I'm fine, I'm fine

478
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
I'm fine

479
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,260
You're my favorite

480
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,260
You're my favorite

481
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,260
You're my favorite

482
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,260
You're my favorite

483
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,260
Your favorite

484
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
You're my favorite

485
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,260
My, my, my, my,

486
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,260
my, my, my

487
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,260
Fast and

488
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:49,240
heavy

489
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,260
The, no.

490
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,160
Breez and

491
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
Flied

492
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,260
I've never been

493
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,260
Oh my god!

494
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,260
Wow!

495
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,260
Where do you come from now on?

496
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,260
Oh!

497
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,260
Where am I going to go?

498
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,260
Oh my god!

499
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,260
Where do you ever know and so many?

500
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,260
Well, I'm just going to go on this point.

501
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:32,260
I don't know.

502
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,260
I mean, it was a good matchup, but it kind of lacked soul.

503
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,260
You know what I mean?

504
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,260
Well, I'm glad it fits.

505
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,260
Well, you have to take a picture.

506
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,260
Sometimes I hear downstairs, you're playing all the mashup things.

507
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,260
Yeah.

508
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,260
That's not good.

509
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,260
But those are the ones that don't make it on the air.

510
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,260
You know?

511
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,260
Yeah, but a lot of them are even on the radio.

512
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,260
You hear mashups on the radio?

513
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,260
Sometimes you hear those mixes.

514
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,260
It does not go together.

515
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,260
But you don't really hear mashups.

516
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,260
I hate that.

517
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,260
I hate that if you heard mashups on the radio.

518
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,260
No, not really the mess up.

519
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,260
More.

520
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,260
More this.

521
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,260
The mess ups.

522
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,260
Yeah.

523
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,260
Are we done with the final? How about the reunion?

524
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,260
Yeah, that was fun.

525
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,260
Yeah, because this was the big curry family reunion.

526
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,260
You have a family that is so old fashioned.

527
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,260
So old fashioned.

528
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,260
Really?

529
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,260
Really true American American.

530
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,260
American family.

531
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,260
What do you mean?

532
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,260
The legs on their forehead.

533
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,260
Yes.

534
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,260
We are very, very patriotic.

535
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,260
Yes.

536
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
I think everyone is pretty much a Republican.

537
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,260
I would have to say, although they are definitely not all for George Bush.

538
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,260
I think all of them hate him.

539
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,260
You could make a movie from these people.

540
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
Easily.

541
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,260
Easily.

542
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,260
He's exactly what you see in movies.

543
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,260
I never thought he would really exist.

544
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,260
Still exist.

545
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,260
Yeah, dude.

546
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,260
Totally true.

547
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,260
So what sticks out in your mind last?

548
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,260
You know, you got well.

549
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,260
It's a little bit crazy.

550
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,260
Oh yeah.

551
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,260
Oh yeah.

552
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,260
A good way.

553
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,260
Yeah.

554
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,260
Uh huh.

555
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,260
We're all kind of fucked up in our little special way.

556
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,260
Yeah.

557
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,260
Special way.

558
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,260
Come on.

559
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,260
What were the high days?

560
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:19,260
Well, some of them I was disappointed because I remember when we, well, when we were

561
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:25,260
there the first time when we just arrived in America and yeah, 87 88.

562
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,260
They were all, remember when we were sitting at the, at the, at the, at the, at the, at the, at the.

563
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
It's Thanksgiving table.

564
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,260
And everybody was looking at me.

565
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,260
Like what is that?

566
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,260
Who is she?

567
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,260
She's from another planet.

568
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
Yes.

569
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,260
Nice bag.

570
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
Yeah.

571
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,260
So everybody's staring at me and all those questions.

572
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,260
So you're in show.

573
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,260
Okay.

574
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,260
That was 20 years ago.

575
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,260
Okay.

576
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,260
So, and they looked at us like.

577
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,260
Yeah.

578
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,260
The two of them.

579
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Very suspicious.

580
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,260
Fishy combination.

581
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,260
You know, but now after all these years, we're still together.

582
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,260
And all these people, some of them actually, now more, more of them.

583
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
Most of them are separate.

584
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,260
They're just separated.

585
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,260
Separated.

586
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,260
Separated.

587
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,260
Yeah.

588
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,260
Yeah.

589
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,260
They're in marriage.

590
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,260
And a lot of them that couple of them have been to some changes.

591
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,260
That's for sure.

592
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,260
And they actually looked at us like it's never going to last.

593
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,260
So the real, so kind of a bummer for a lot of people who listen to the daily source

594
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,260
course that I didn't do an interview with, with Uncle Don.

595
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,260
Yeah.

596
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,260
You know, I did talk to him about it.

597
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,260
And I think that I've now, now I understand why he, he's trying to figure out what

598
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,260
he wants to do after it.

599
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,260
Yeah.

600
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,260
So he wrote that commentary on the book Legacy of Ashes.

601
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,260
Review.

602
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,260
Yeah.

603
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,260
A commentary.

604
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,260
He called it a review.

605
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
No.

606
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
He called it a commentary.

607
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,260
I heard something else.

608
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,260
Oh, man.

609
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,260
Here it is.

610
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,260
Right here.

611
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Oh, then maybe he explained it to me.

612
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,260
A commentary on Tim Winner's Legacy of Ashes.

613
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,260
Well, maybe commentary.

614
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,260
I looked at him and he said, sort of a,

615
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,260
He explained to me like that.

616
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,260
Like a review.

617
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,260
Yeah.

618
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,260
It was too long for a review.

619
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,260
That's why.

620
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,260
But now just having read through.

621
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,260
It's like, he has like 700 pages this book.

622
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,260
It's a, it's a, it's a big ass book.

623
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
That's the one there.

624
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,260
The, the red one that I've been reading.

625
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,260
My, started tonight.

626
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,260
Not, not.

627
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,260
But I can understand why he's freaked out.

628
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
Yeah.

629
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,260
Because, you know, this book really,

630
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,260
in fact, what it really says is that he was responsible

631
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,260
the wrong word, but that he trained hundreds and hundreds of

632
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,260
Koreans to fight against North Korea and all of them died.

633
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,260
Just none of them came back because it was so fucked up

634
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,260
with the CIA that all the information that they were passing on

635
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
was lied.

636
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
Nothing, you know, there was no truth.

637
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,260
They had no real intelligence.

638
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,260
So, but he didn't know that.

639
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,260
No, of course he didn't know it.

640
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,260
But can you imagine that when that comes out that you just like

641
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,260
freaking out when you learn that all of your guys,

642
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,260
of course he knew that they, that they perished,

643
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,260
but he didn't know it was because his glasses were fucked up.

644
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,260
It's very heavy, low.

645
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,260
Have you low to carry in your life?

646
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,260
So, but I think I know how I'm going to approach this.

647
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,260
Yeah.

648
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,260
Yeah.

649
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,260
I'm working on some ideas.

650
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,260
I mean, he could actually do a lot

651
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:22,260
by telling people how, how the CIA worked from his perspective.

652
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
Yeah.

653
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,260
Is he allowed to explain it?

654
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,260
Well, no, he's not allowed.

655
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,260
That's the whole point.

656
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,260
Well, but, you know, the guys almost say,

657
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
you know, because I said, you know,

658
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,260
we could, there's a whole bunch of things we can do.

659
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,260
Yeah.

660
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,260
And he's really, you know, I think he's just,

661
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
I think he's freaked out about what he's,

662
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,260
what he's learning now, all these years later.

663
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,260
There's learning how is sinless.

664
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,260
Sin senseless, it all was.

665
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Yeah.

666
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
So, did you have a nice chat with him?

667
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
Yeah.

668
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,260
Oh, yeah.

669
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,260
He's a very interesting guy.

670
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,260
Very charming.

671
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,260
Yeah.

672
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,260
Oh, yeah.

673
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,260
You know, he's got that president kind of a thing.

674
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,260
I love it when he tells stories.

675
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,260
I love it when he tells his stories.

676
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,260
He does that well.

677
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,260
He loved your Clinton story, though.

678
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,260
Oh.

679
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,260
Boy, he loved that.

680
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,260
He thought that was awesome.

681
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,260
He thought that was awesome.

682
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,260
He thought that was awesome.

683
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,260
Yeah.

684
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,260
And he said, actually, the Clinton was quite a charmer.

685
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,260
And that people had, all the women in the office had to watch out for him,

686
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,260
because he was a butt pincher.

687
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,260
You know, he touched everybody.

688
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,260
I don't think, see, this is the stuff I don't think he would say.

689
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,260
I don't think he would.

690
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,260
Yeah, he told you.

691
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,260
Well, Clinton is not listening to you.

692
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,260
You don't know.

693
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
You never know.

694
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,260
You never know.

695
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,260
Clinton's probably, they go like, oh, yeah.

696
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,260
That's not hot babe with the teeth she can take out.

697
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,260
Oh, yeah.

698
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,260
I love it.

699
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,260
Yeah.

700
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
Oh, yeah.

701
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,260
That's mine.

702
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,260
I can't believe it happened to me.

703
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,260
But I told you, I, the moment I saw him,

704
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,260
I, I knew exactly what women were,

705
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,260
you know, attracted to him.

706
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,260
Yeah.

707
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,260
Absolutely.

708
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
I'm attracted to him.

709
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,260
He, he has that.

710
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Yeah.

711
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
He's got that.

712
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,260
That's the thing I have.

713
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,260
That.

714
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
But then different.

715
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Bigger.

716
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,260
I don't know.

717
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,260
He didn't hang him out of his trousers.

718
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
No, no.

719
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
In the elevator.

720
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
I bet he's not.

721
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,260
I bet he's huge.

722
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,260
I bet he's huge.

723
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,260
I bet he's huge.

724
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
I bet he's huge.

725
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
I think so too.

726
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,260
You know, when I look at his nose.

727
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,260
He's nose is his nose.

728
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,260
His nose, I do.

729
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,260
We did square dance.

730
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,260
How American was that?

731
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
Oh, my god.

732
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,260
I square dance.

733
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,260
Yeah.

734
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
What's that amazing?

735
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,260
Yeah, I did.

736
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,260
That was, we'll get pictures from that.

737
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,260
That was pretty funny.

738
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,260
It was awesome, dude.

739
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,260
And, and line.

740
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,260
Blind dancing, yeah.

741
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,260
Blind dance.

742
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,260
It's my family awesome.

743

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
Yeah.

748
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
You're so right, though.

749
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,260
It is so worthy of a documentary.

750
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,260
Yeah.

751
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
Yeah.

752
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,260
Our family is pretty interesting.

753
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,260
And it wasn't this beautiful little.

754
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
What was it?

755
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,260
Sort of.

756
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,260
They call it the Quakers.

757
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,260
Yeah.

758
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,260

759
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
Quakers.

760
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,260
Quakers.

761
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,260
Quakers.

762
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,260
Quakers.

763
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,260
Quakers.

764
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,260
Quakers.

765
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,260
Quakers.

766
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,260
Quakers.

767
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,260
Quakers.

768
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,260
Quakers.

769
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,260
Quakers.

770
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,260
Quakers.

771
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,260
Oh, yeah.

772
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,260
Yeah, like early settlers bar.

773
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,260
Yeah.

774
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,260
So I said, and that's all.

775
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,260
I'm like, Oh, yeah.

776
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,260

777
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,260
Very, very old.

778
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,260
When I said that's, though.

779
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,260
Because you remember the 1800s, of course, don't you?

780
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
Yes, I did.

781
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,260
Now, do you remember the 70s?

782
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
The 60s, 70s and 80s?

783
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,260
Would you like to put your knowledge to the test with young Polats Hit Test?

784
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,260
Yes, I would.

785

Okay.

786

00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,460
Sweet dreams are made of this.

No.

803
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,260
Oh, she just comes third and the final one is number 3.

So run as it turns yours.

806
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,260

809
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,260
She's number one.

00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,260
I got that one in the sunshine band.

811
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,260
That's the way.

812
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,260
I like it.

813
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,260
Okay, take this on me.

00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,400
Redmix from 1983

816
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,080
This was in 1983

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,880
You're at mix and three dreams is enter number two and this is answer number three for this week's

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
I never cared about this guy

820
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,680
I can't even sing the lyrics

821
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:06,480
From 1987, Alexander O'Neill and Criticize and that concludes hit test number 84

822
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,080
What? I don't speak Dutch. He's throwing tricks again. Thanks to be strikes

823
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,040
In iTunes can be found that the hit test of patch show does come

824
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,920
That's also the place to take the weight off

825
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,240
All right, yet am I hope you had them all and you enjoyed these three songs as always

826
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,400
We call the back for eight this number 85

827
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,320
So I hope to see you then until then take care and bye-bye

828
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,720
Seeing your face isn't he doesn't he make you tired?

829
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:48,160
I love him. Yeah, that's like that's like a marathon. That's a high-paced energy. That's a yarn pull that

830
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,400
You got one out of three. I didn't know it started already

831
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,160
I thought it was just part of the

832
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,600
No, you said he has clue number one and you got the dude

833
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,400
I didn't know this dude. I didn't know it was hidden in there. Oh, I didn't know and you writes some of the songs

834
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,920
From these days. I probably ignore oh, I know yeah, well of course no no no

835
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,520
This was 75

836
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,360
For case in sunshine man 80, but you remember your red nicks don't you remember your red nicks?

837
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,560
Good one. Yeah, that was the same period. You love that one. It's still good pumping out the hits. Yeah, it's like from today. It's beautiful

838
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,840
Yeah, but Alexander and Neil. I had no idea. Oh, no, I didn't know. I just wanted you to hear the

839
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,040
The latest version. This is something we're working on

840
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,040
You've already heard a previous version. I just want to play this little bit for a second

841
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,200
The lost Elvis diaries

842
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Written by Elvis and Presley

843
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,880
I don't readily know if my story has a beginning or an ending

844
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,160
I'm just writing as a comes to me the way I done most things in my life. I cool this that people tell them I'm a natural, but

845
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,920
I'm not so sure what that means. We're bringing them back from the dead

846
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,240
Elvis yeah

847
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,480
Aaron Presley. This is the way he would sound now. What do you mean so that is him?

848
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,680
This is the king the lost Elvis diaries. No problem. She's probably

849
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:23,040
That's a good question. Yeah. Oh, there's going to be all kinds of shit. Absolutely, but this book is going to be awesome

850
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,360
Yeah, the lost Elvis diaries. I've already read it. Yeah, it's good. Excuse me

851
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,360
Why don't you do that while I'm playing the Elvis diaries? No, you got to do that afterwards. So

852
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,920
One horrible horrible horrible horrible thing has happened

853
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:56,720
in in the past in the past day and that is. Oh, yeah, but today it happened today. Yeah, happened today

854
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,960
And you know, it's not something that happens to you. It has to be

855
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,120
It is definitely something that always happens to you sometimes to Christina, but pretty much never to be

856
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,240
It happens a couple of times to me. So can you guess

857
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
People Botox

858
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,600
When wrong the Botox when wrong now. No

859
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,680
As I do on a nice Sunday morning. In fact, I do it every morning. Yeah, I go into the back bathroom

860
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,400
Daily download day. I'm ready for the daily download. I've got my my cup of chino

861
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,400
I've got something to read sometimes all I'll open up the door so I can still get Wi-Fi not the actual bathroom door

862
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:47,440
But the interconnect door so I get my Wi-Fi sometimes where you're not here. Please stay away for just about half an hour at least half an hour

863
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:55,760
And I was listening to on the media, which is a show from NPR, which I like listening to listening to that on the iPod function of my iPhone

864
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,640
Now look I'm my bathrobe on so I put the iPhone in the breast pocket

865
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,840
Right yeah, and I get up to flush

866
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,480
And just as I get up, I'm not quite sure what are you doing? I mean the middle of a story. You'll be fine

867
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,280
To steep you can be fine. You can always roll down the like a

868
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
Like a slinky

869
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,080
Okay, so I stand up to flush the toilet

870
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,880
And my hand is it hasn't even gotten into motion towards the flusher luckily. I would say and

871
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:39,760
And I have the ear buds in. I'm still listening to the show and I just see my iPhone just go right out of my breast pocket

872
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,160
Well, I was hoping that you know the wire the connector would stay and but you know you got that very just

873
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,880
As the connector dislodge and when clunk right into the bowl

874
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Oh no, pre flush

875
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,480
So of course, I do what what any true nerd would do is take your hand

876
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,080
I jam my hand in so fast. I pull that puppy out and and litter this shit all over it

877
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,520
I'm not kidding. Oh my god. That is disgusting only on one corner and

878
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,200
You know and only on one corner again. Well, that's a really the ear corner not the mouth corner

879
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:26,240
And you know normally because this has happened it's happened to you it's happened to Christina you rip off the back

880
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,920
You pull out the battery and then dry it out. Yeah, I did that to mine

881
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,800
But you can't open the iPhone you can't there you can't replace the battery. So I can see the port

882
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:41,200
It's still it's still on it's still basically working and then I see it shut down and reboot and shut down and reboot

883
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,560
And I see this thing going on and off and on and off and I'm like I run upstairs. I

884
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,600
You know, first I wiped it off with the paper towel I washed my hands and then

885
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:58,160
And then I'm blow drying it for at least 20 minutes and it's booting up it's stopping and then it's just stopped

886
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:05,680
And then it stopped doing anything and now I've had it on the the radiator for a little while and according to someone on the the weblog

887
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
There was a

888
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,520
Technology guy Andy in a neat in the dough

889
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,680
In the ink toe whatever's name is and he suggested

890
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,800
He suggested putting it in a top of where box filled with kitty litter because that draws out the moisture

891
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,760
Which is like it's kind of like those little silicon gel bags you get when you buy new equipment

892
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,640
So yeah, but I'm afraid that that's something's fried already because then you I couldn't remove the battery

893
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,080
Which makes it pretty dumb for a mobile device. I have to say

894
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,000
And I'm pretty bummed out about yeah, I know can't understand. Yes, I can

895
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:48,880
You have nothing else to say now what can I say? I mean, you know, you think it'll work

896
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:55,040
What happens to the best? I have to say though. This is really important because I don't I don't think any mobile phone is

897
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
If a phone can't recover from

898
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,480
Well, if this happened to someone in people maybe they can make a waterproof phone. Yeah. Yeah

899
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
So this isn't this isn't waterproof

900
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,520
The with the nokey is aren't waterproof, but at least you couldn't you know you can save them

901
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,440
Most phones you can basically save if you can take the battery out. Yeah, so if the iPhone isn't

902
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,600
Savable that way. I'd say that's a big strike against that as as my phone of choice because

903
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,320
You know that's gonna happen to lots of people a lot of people I think so too

904
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,080
You know because sometimes you have anything you back pocket of your jeans

905
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:37,040
Never have it in the back pocket. Yeah, I'd always have it in the left pocket. No, I have to because it doesn't fit there

906
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,480
But I I have it on the bot. Oh, I have it there because the special vibrations give me great pleasure

907
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,360
Mine doesn't vibrate. No, no, you're phone doesn't vibrate. Would you like me to turn that on for you?

908
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
No

909
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Computer says no

910
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
All right

911
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,160
You gotta play this one again since it went to number one and iTunes. It's Blake Morgan

Maybe I'm a maze at the way you're with me all the time

922
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,240
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you

932
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,720
Maybe I'm a maze at the way you're with me all the time

933
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,120
Maybe I'm a little lonely man

934
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:03,200
It's in the bedroom so I feel that he doesn't really understand

935
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,680
Maybe I'm a man

936
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,080
Maybe you're the only one that I could have let help me

937
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,720

Maybe I'm a maze

940
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
Oh

941
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,600
Maybe I'm a maze

942
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Maybe I'm a maze

943
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,240
Maybe I'm a maze

944
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,720
It's exactly the way I want to be able to play the electric guitar

945
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,840
Everybody dolling everybody

946
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,120
Yeah, play Morgan went straight to number one and I tunes

947
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,400
The day of release played on the I think it's uh was it the most the most played

948
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,760
Let's see one of the most played songs

949
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,720
What about music network this month? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a great song

950
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,000
And I don't understand why Paul McCartney never ever did anything or remakes or any

951
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,120
Different versions of the song or something with a waces together or with a new band together

952
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:27,280
He never does the interesting idea with a waces. No, I don't think he's really hip and with it quite honest

953
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,520
That's what I mean if you are if because I think of Paul as a hip guy

954
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,840
You know, it's to be very hip guy memo to put memo to pass if you want to stay with it

955
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,160
If you want to stay with it and stay your cool guy you should go collaborate. Is that yeah, yeah

956
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,200
Do a joint yeah, do something with the young guys

957
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,440
Yeah, that won't keep you young but you know Uncle Paul doesn't do that. No, he doesn't he goes with his little you

958
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,560
And it has a little you can lay Lee look you really where's he playing with a ukulele

959
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,680
Play the ukulele on the downs. Did you see the clip on the down? No, you kidding me

960
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,880
Yes, he was on down. Yeah, with a ukulele

961
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Yeah, and I think you know

962
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,880
It's nice song, but it's a fucking ukulele dude the cool guy that I used to know

963
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,760
No, yeah, that's a bit disappointed. Yeah, no, I can understand

964
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,000
But I'd like this version. I'd like would play more than I would be so I would be very jealous if I were Paul well

965
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,920
He does not have to be really jealous because he's gonna make he's any it's gonna make some money off

966
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,400
I know but yeah, doesn't it you know I would I don't care honestly

967
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,520
I don't care. I'm really happy for Blake Morgan. I'm very happy for Blake too

968
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,880
I'm sorry

969
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,680
No, I know you don't want to harsh on Blake smell

970
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
You know push away Blake

971
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
It's incredible incredible

972
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,840
version this one it's wonderful. It's so powerful

973
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:57,200
But this is one of the guys who is who is showing the way of the pod save music revolution

974
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,800
Yeah, he's doing it, you know, he's he's he's making a living doing this

975
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
He has a label

976
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,960
Yeah, so is it is it growing is it going? It is actually yeah

977
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,560
Well, you saw that an heart and heart and Wilson from heart

978
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,360
Come on the positive music network. So you know there's lots of artists who are damn good who are coming out with new material on new labels

979
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:26,400
That understand that there's new ways of promoting and new ways of getting a music out there and actually I should put a link into the

980
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,920
Into the show notes to this article that I found at hoodhype.com

981
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,960
It's a story written by a famous music producer. I can't find it right now and

982
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,560
He tallyed up exactly a band who signed with a major label they sold

983
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:50,960
250,000 records, so that's three million dollars. What are you looking at? No, nothing. What are you looking at? You were looking at a dog because he's walking

984
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,480
Backwards, he's lifting his leg to one of the guitars. That would not be good. Whoa

985
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,040
3p

986
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
Yeah, oh god

987
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,040
Adam has all these guitars lined up. The dog lifts his leg right up against my my Steve I

988
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,600
Signature that Steve Steven's a signature edition, which is my acts of choice. I said no

989
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
What the hell was I talking about

990
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,680
I was gonna make you real good point

991
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,960
Oh, okay, about this band that's that signed with the major DM major record label sold 250,000 copies

992
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,440
That's at 12 bucks just three million dollars and after you know like five weeks of touring support and all that stuff

993
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,920
They broke it down and you know the band each member made seven hundred eighty one dollars. No, of course

994
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:57,200
You get 13% over retail, but we know of 90% over retail, so you know that that basically turns out to

995
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,480
To be nothing and these guys, you know they're putting out their own CDs and yeah, it costs some money

996
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,680
But they're making maybe five six bucks on a CD sold

997
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,440
You know, it's a big difference. Yeah, this is why I tried to keep dragging you into the podcast music revolution my dear

998
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,560
Well, you would be so great. You would be legendary

999
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,600
Yeah, well

1000
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
We'll I'm on the student

1001
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,080
What you what do you mean? You can do that anytime you want? No, but I mean the last you know

1002
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,840
Let's go to Nashville. Let's go to Nashville

1003
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,240
Wait until I'm done with my big band. Who knows where that's going?

1004
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,720
I'm not allowed to talk about that. No, but you've sworn me to secrecy, so I can't say anything

1005
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,880
The only thing I can say is I found a great big band as well. We're gonna see if we can do something together

1006
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,400
I'm not allowed to say anything

1007
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,120
Put it together and see what we can do and make you

1008
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,440
But you know there's so many I mean can you look at all these towns that people they're dying for great singing talent

1009
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,960
They'll do anything to get you into their studio to sing on some of their tracks

1010
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,960
I'm telling you now

1011
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,360
Yes, what are you talking about? Absolutely

1012
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:06,000
You know how hard it is to get talented musicians really good ones. It's hard for nothing for nothing for me

1013
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,600
No, but it's very hard to get them for free

1014
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah, but you need to take it to fly in

1015
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,040
Then you know I'll fly you to and I'm telling you Nashville is the place to be right now

1016
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,800
That's where it's all happened. We should go to Nashville. Yeah, there's all kinds of awesome stuff

You might as long as you're at the inside

I think it's time just like me. Is everything you say they're all really old

Yeah, it's actually sent in by a buddy of his

1049
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,280
That's why I did it

1050
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,280
It's more kick the dog

1051
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,280
We sent this in Craig Nicholson

1052
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,280
We saw that blood diamonds movie last night

1053
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,280
We watched that, that was pretty impressive

1054
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,280
Yeah, it was

1055
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,280
Two and a half hours

1056
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,280
I was really long movie

1057
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,280
Yeah, but I wasn't bored or anything

1058
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,280
It was very interesting

1059
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,280
True

1060
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,280

00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,280
DiCaprio

1064
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,280
Yeah, he's pretty good

1065
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,280
Does he ever become the hero of the movie?

1066
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,280
Well, I guess he is kind of the hero

1067
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,280
He dies, but he's the hero

1068
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,280
Yeah

1069
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
Good accent though

1070
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,280
I really like this

1071
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,280
That was a little bit of Dutch here and there

1072
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,280
Kind of

1073
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,280
Yeah, just a bit

1074
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,280
Yeah

1075
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,280
He said, he said, yeah

1076
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,280
Yeah, couple of times

1077
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,280
Yeah, I'll brew

1078
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,280
Yeah, I'll brew

1079
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,280
So

1080
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,280
I'm going to be home for one more week

1081
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,280
It's going to be a busy week

1082
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,280
And then I think every single day, except for tomorrow

1083
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,280
Tomorrow is bank holiday

1084
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,280
Yeah

1085
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,280
And what are you going to be doing?

1086
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,280
Bank holiday

1087
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,280
No, what are you doing all week?

1088
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,280
No week

1089
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,280
Christina has to go back to school

1090
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,280
No, that's next week

1091
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,280
That's next week

1092
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,280
I'm going to go to the hairdresser

1093
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,280
Hmm

1094
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,280
I have a major route

1095
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,280
Outroing

1096
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,280
What is that?

1097
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,280
What do you call that?

1098
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,280
Your routes are showing?

1099
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,280
Yes

1100
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,280
Who?

1101
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,280
Who?

1102
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,280
I don't notice it

1103
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,280
No, I don't see any grey

1104
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,280
No

1105
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,280
I'm not grey

1106
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,280
No, of course not

1107
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,280
I'm young

1108
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,280
Yes

1109
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,280
What else?

1110
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,280
It's going to be actually a very easy week

1111
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,280
I'll leave back a little bit later

1112
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,280
Okay

1113
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,280
Because they are for Holland

1114
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,280
Christina

1115
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,280
Because they fashion show

1116
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,280
Before we go to

1117
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,280
To go to school

1118
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,280
Of course

1119
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,280
Back to school Christina

1120
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,280
I take her to a couple of beautiful

1121
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,280
Fashion shows

1122
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,280
That's your version of back to school

1123
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,280
We have to get ready for school

1124
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,280
So we have to go to some co-tour

1125
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,280
Well

1126
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,280
This is good for her too

1127
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,280
You know, it's good to talk to people

1128
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,280
And we go a little bit

1129
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,280
She's a debutant

1130
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,280
She will be debutant

1131
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,280
Oh my goodness

1132
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,280
Because I never take her to this

1133
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,280
She's excited

1134
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,280
But she's into

1135
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,280
You know, it's from a friend of mine

1136
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,280
So

1137
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,280
I'm sorry I can't take you back

1138
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,280
And I haven't seen her for a while

1139
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,280
They will be amazed

1140
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,280
They will be amazed

1141
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,280
Maybe I'm amazed

1142
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,280
That your daughter's grown so big

1143
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,280
And tall

1144
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,280
Maybe I'm amazed

1145
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,280
She's a woman

1146
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,280
What hips and breath

1147
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,280
Yeah, okay

1148
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,280
Alright baby

1149
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,280
I don't know

1150
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,280
I'm empty

1151
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,280
Yeah

1152
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,280
It's warm up here

1153
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,280
You have to say

1154
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,280
It's very hot

1155
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,280
Yeah, it's very warm

1156
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,280
And we have jet lag

1157
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,280
Yeah

1158
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,280
So I'm amazed

1159
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,280
Anyway

1160
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,280
Yeah, I'm amazed

1161
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,280
To use that word again

1162
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,280
Because we have a major jet lag

1163
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,280
And we get up

1164
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,280
Way too late

1165
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,280
Every day

1166
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,280
Oh man

1167
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,280
Today was 930

1168
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,280
That was okay

1169
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,280
But it's so hard to wake up

1170
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,280
I got to get back into the swing

1171
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,280
I know

1172
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,280
This sucks

1173
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,280
Yeah, but we went

1174
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,280
We went a bit too late

1175
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,280
Yeah, but that's because the crappery

1176
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,280
Oh was so long

1177
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,280
I didn't know it was going to be 2.5 hours

1178
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,280
I thought I mean

1179
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,280
I movie is like an hour and a half

1180
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,280
That's normal 90 minutes

1181
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,280
You know, made a big bite of own

1182
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,280
Yeah, but normally I fall asleep

1183
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,280
I was awake

1184
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,280
I was glancing over

1185
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,280
Now the movie was really top-notch

1186
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,280
And Patricia doesn't fall asleep

1187
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,280
During the movie

1188
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,280
Yeah

1189
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,280
You go to any movie with me

1190
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,280
In the theater and fall asleep

1191
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,280
If it's not a good movie, I will

1192
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,280
Well

1193
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,280
If it's a good movie

1194
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,280
You know, I'm there

1195
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,280
Okay

1196
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,280
Till the end

1197
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,280
We're going to pick the Oscars this year

1198
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,280
And you know what we're going to do

1199
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,280
That we're going to take you to every single movie

1200
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,280
And if you fall asleep

1201
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,280
It's not a winner

1202
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,280
Exactly

1203
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,280
Yeah, okay

1204
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,280
It'll be the pat test

1205
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,280
Yeah

1206
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,280
The pat Oscar test

1207
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,280
Better known as pot

1208
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,280
Yeah

1209
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,280
The pat test

1210
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,280
Exactly

1211
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,280
All right, baby

1212
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,280
Thank you for joining us

1213
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,280

And what time is Christina coming home

1223

Who knows

1224
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,280
Are you too tired for sex

1225
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,280
Right now

1226
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,280
No, no, no

1227
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,280
I gotta do show notes

1228

1245
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,280
Can I do it

1246
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,280
Okay

1247
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,280
All right, you're late

1248
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,280

1255
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,280
The pissing dog

1256
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,280
There we go

1257
