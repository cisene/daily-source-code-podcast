1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
For the next generation radio content in my ears.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We don't mean us.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We can get rid of you.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I like to think I'm trying to make sure.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Autistic.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's Adam Curry.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Dr. Doctor, do you think he's in a make it?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't know what to mean, but there's a few things we can try.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
First, James Earbuds and his ears real tight.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now, crank up the DSC 570.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All right, I can do find this picture in the current time.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll just open the basket and see if he'll come around.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That guy's coming right in, look.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's good.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's good. Keep it up.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Keep cranking the DSC 570.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Of course, he'll picture the current time I always have.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will look for my eyes.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The wind's coming with my help.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You might have come up from the war.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
He will have supper that I put to be moved.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He that keep it be will not slumber.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Behold, he that keep it is real.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
He'll tell me they're slumber.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The Lord is that keeper.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The Lord is that I shade upon their right hand.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We shall preserve thy soul.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The Lord shall preserve that going out.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I coming in from this time for it.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000

Here in the whole thing for the third time, I'm liking it.

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It is, of course, the Shakes from the pod and set music network.

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I want a better life.

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is the Dr. Remix.

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I put up two remixes yesterday.

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And something about it just like, yeah.

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,600
like yeah. Awesome. Can wait to hear this one in the

128
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,200
clubs, fellas. Everybody how you doing is daily source code

129
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,200
episode five hundred and seventy five seven zero coming to you

130
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,640
from the affluent suburb of Surinone is gulford the west side of

131
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,280
G-town is represented for you. It's the curry manner up in the

132
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,000
air and Adams attic more a more iteration for you perhaps it

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,240
is a beautiful day outside. I'm so hoping that the weather keeps

134
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,840
up for tomorrow because there's a sixty percent chance that my

135
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,440
aircraft will be returned which means you probably won't have a

136
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,560
daily source code tomorrow morning because I'll be in transit. If you

137
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,320
don't have a daily source code by Thursday then you'll know that

138
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,160
something didn't go well with the English channel navigation

139
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,520
solo flying you know what I'm saying. Lots of thoughts today

140
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,560
about bum rush the charts lots of bum rush thoughts that

141
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,360
listeners in the UK please do not be alarmed I know that you think of

142
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,560
something different when I talk about bum rush.

143
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,440
Speaking of bum rushing hold on a second let me open up the other microphone.

144
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,600
I think something must have gone wrong with uh with my email and Amy Mac last

145
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,240
week because well I've quite frankly I didn't get to ask her size.

146
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,760
Make it to the other mic.

147
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,640
Hello. All right there we go.

148
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,040
Amy, thank you so much.

149
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,160
Adam, hey, Amy Matt. Hey, Matt.

150
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,800
How you doing today? We're doing tiptoe squat.

151
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,280
Tiptoe squats okay. I'm sure there's a more masculine name for him but I like this one.

152
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,640
Yeah there's no masculine name for him. You're going to start standing tall with

153
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,520
feet facing out in a diagonal away from you and hands on hips okay away from

154
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,160
that. Nowadays up under your tiptoe's and then squat down as far as you can

155
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,720
keeping those heels off the ground. Taking them like with me.

156
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,240
You want your head shoulders and hips to all be in a straight line.

157
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,400
So no sticking that booty back. It's hurting into the right hands.

158
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,200
Squeeze the butt as you come up. Coming.

159
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,680
Come on. Good. Now you have nine more to do.

160
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,720
All right all my tips. This is really good for your core as well because you have to keep your

161
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,080
balance on this one. Yeah you do. It's going to nasty or don't hold your breath.

162
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,000
You always remind me to breathe and I'm so happy you do. Stay up on those tiptoe.

163
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,440
Yes yes yes. Oh that squeeze the butt nabs. It's kind of weird. Good job.

164
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,640
Makes me want to have a great weekend and until next time.

165
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,040
I think I I was a little premature with the exercise.

166
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,800
Pre-missue or a ascertainization. Yeah have a great weekend as well. It's only Tuesday where I'm

167
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,120
living. I'm sorry. I'll let me close the other mic there. That's the lady Patricia's mic.

168
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,320
Ugh. That's really weird. You should try that one. This of course is in the continuing quest to

169
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,960
tone up my ass because I sit on it most of the time. Now that I have the sit down studio instead

170
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,840
of the stand-up studio. The whole office is sit down for Cry 6.

171
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,520
Let me just catch my breath. I should try that tiptoe thing.

172
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,400
Because when you go all the way down to the ground it feels like you're squatting like you want to do

173
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:47,000
something nasty. Let's see what my condition is so shit. Let's see what's coming on the

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
voicemail comments. Of course, no milk cast complete without a comment from Eric Burgund's mom.

175
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,520
Hey Adam. Alice in the ear. Hey. By the way. No hummer. Rapcast.com.

176
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,640
So I had to call in and say something after listening to my son's speak and after talking

177
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,200
to him in great lengths last week. That would be Eric Burgund calling it about bummering the

178
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,480
charts. Hold on a second. Now did I already play this for you? I don't know. If I already

179
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,440
played it just fast forward. And I got to say something that the two of you left out that I think

180
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:29,880
is really important, which is how you feel and how empowering it is once you do something like this,

181
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,480
that it's not about getting a song to number one. It's about being heard. It's not about

182
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,080
well, do we just pick a song? We didn't really care about the song itself. We just wanted to show

183
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,120
we can do it. Like you said Adam, yeah, that is what it's about. But even more importantly about

184
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,880
that, it's like having that experience that you can do it because what happens next is exactly

185
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,000
that. What do you want to have next? Once you realize that you have the power to change something

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,560
like that, it's freeing. You just know, okay, what am I going to do next? How do I get heard more?

187
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,640
It's no surprise to me. In the times today, there's an article written by Jeff Leeds called

188
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,640
the album, a commodity in disfavor with the tagline underneath, with CD sales falling,

189
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,600
label-seek new deals with Apple. Here's a quote from the article,

190
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,880
executives maintain that they must establish more lasting connections with fans who may

191
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,680
well lose interest if forced to wait two years or more for their favorite artist,

192
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:36,440
releasing new music. Well, there you go. I mean, that is what podcasting and everything has

193
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,120
over everything. It's why I started craftcast. I realized that loved all the crafting networks,

194
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,160
but when they went into repeats, there was no new information you had to wait months.

195
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:55,800
And here is a format where you can put out information every day. I know from the subscribers

196
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,920
and people who write in who listen to me and how my fanbase is grown, that people want to be

197
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:08,120
able to have that kind of content that there's a need for it. It's very exciting. It's really

198
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,560
the bottom line. I can barely wait to hear what the next bum rush the chart type of that is,

199
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,880
because it's just it's being on the frontier edge here. It's just all unfolding and it's really

200
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:28,760
exciting. So big thank you to you Adam. Love your show and love all the discussions and look

201
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,840
forward to what's happening next. Naked pictures. That's what's happening. As you say unfolding around

202
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,680
unscrewing before I very eyes, I didn't quite catch it. Yeah, bum rush the charts has it has a

203
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,920
different meaning for every person involved. And that's what's nice about it because it didn't

204
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:52,280
have really one central drive behind it. But it is of course an audience exercise. And I've thought

205
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,600
about this. Remember yesterday, I just thought started popping into my head. This is exactly what

206
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,600
happens to hip hoppers. Whenever they receive an award, they always thank God for putting those

207
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,160
lyrics into their heads. It's exactly what happened to me yesterday. And I want to share those thoughts

208
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,400
with you. But first to continue in the bum rush thoughts with some other typical griping,

209
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,560
it's our friend. You know, we need a jingle for this guy. It's the New York Londoner. It's the

210
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:24,280
nylon. Hey, Adam. It's the nylon. The New Yorker in London. I can just hear Jeff Smith's brain

211
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,440
crunching what he can do with the nylon. I know you're in a little budget there. You can't

212
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,680
employ a sack check, checker. So, oh, yeah. Oh, nylon. Why do you start off like this? Yeah.

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,480
I know you want a little budget dude. You can play a trick tricker. No, that's what I have

214
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,000
you for. You're my fact checking bitch. Corrections and then a final word on bum rush to talk.

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,520
All right. First, the reason why you probably don't know about the E.C. 50th is that

216
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,040
it's actually the European economic community that's somewhere in the 50th birthday. And that

217
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,560
consists of Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. It wasn't

218
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:08,200
sort of master treaty in 92 that what we now know is the European community came into force. So,

219
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,840
it's only about seven countries that actually were part of that gum celebration. I'm signing back

220
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:19,080
in 1957, I guess. Second. Okay, before we go to second. All right. Well, thank you very much for

221
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,120
the correction. That does explain a lot if the U.K. was not in that region, in that treaty from

222
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,680
1957. Then this is what I mean. It's so confusing. We've got the European economic community. We've

223
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:39,000
got the European Union. It's complicated. Why can't it? Why can't it just be easier to understand?

224
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,720
And yeah, you're right. I don't have fact checkers for that. If I had to fact check everything,

225
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,760
I'd be like fucking mainstream media dude. Of course, I do expect comics to be blogger to check in.

226
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,880
He is the official EU correspondent. Is you mentioned the powerhouse of A.D.M.

227
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,720
Ambro and the Dutch and such. Let me maybe be behind your F.C. But if I'm likely in 90 days,

228
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,240
that A.D.M. will be a Dutch bank to allow the British or American bank. Well, obviously,

229
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,120
I understand that. I could read newspapers too, Nylon. I know that A.B. and Ambro was for sale

230
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,680
due to underperformance. In fact, I think I even alluded to that in what I said. I was very careful

231
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,240
to say it still is a Dutch bank. It's not even a fully owned Dutch bank, of course.

232
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,880
It's part to talk now because you've got me in this whole fact checking thing.

233
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,800
Yeah, I do read the newspaper. And by the way, that's a big part of the discussion going on

234
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,000
in the Netherlands right now is, you know, Unilever has already been partially sold off.

235
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,760
In fact, what does the Netherlands still produce after A.B. and Ambro has gone? What's their main

236
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:53,080
industry besides tourism for tulips and fucking bicycles? Nothing. All the great industry

237
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,160
has been sold off or moved on or consolidated and sold off.

238
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,560
So anyway, thank you for pointing that out. There's made a bit as you know, and probably

239
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,320
city bank will come in. So mine is a collection there. And by the way, Nylon, I'd like to know a little

240
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,560
bit more about what you do exactly. You're in the financial sector. Are you a trader?

241
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,960
You know, a manager or maybe IT manager, banking, of course, is largely an IT business.

242
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,400
Tell me a little bit about you if you don't mind. You're so credible, you know.

243
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,400
On second bank, F.C. again, actually, was that Twitter made the front page of the F.C. at least

244
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:37,640
here in the UK? Yeah, that's uh, I think I said that as well. That's the reason why I brought it

245
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,640
up is because in on the front page, there was a whole article about Twitter. I think at

246
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,040
line, I'll see what you're saying. So be interesting to see how this new little phenomenon has hit

247
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,760
the front page of the Wall Street Journal without even a bummerous, the on-challenge sort of

248
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,520
promotion. Oh, please. Has nothing to do with bum rush the charts? It's completely something

249
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,520
completely different. Podcasting was on the front page of the, it's continues to be on the front

250
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:09,400
page of the F.T. Twitter is a phenomenon. And again, I'll say that there's really only two parts

251
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,720
who would want. I believe that the United States is now finally discovering the simplicity

252
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:20,280
and reliability. I'll just say quote reliability of SMS text messaging. And they're loving it

253
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:27,960
because it's a very personal communications channel. And of course, the the cool thing about it is

254
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,680
that it's opt-in. So it's a published and subscribe mechanism. I think we'll see several of these,

255
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,560
but this is a very, very obvious one. And I think Twitter is really catching on more in the states

256
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,480
because the whole idea of text messaging is now dawning upon. I think a very important group of

257
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,840
influencers and early adopters. So curious thing to watch. And finally, I'll say the topic,

258
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,840
bum rush. Yeah. This is the short version of it. Is that it sounds like a promotion or was

259
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:02,040
a podcast is for a podcast of the benefit barcasters. If there is a bummer chart version 2.0,

260
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,560
make it customer centric. Make it where me, someone in the outside, not like you, someone in the

261
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:14,680
inside, look at it and say, okay, as a customer, I see what this is doing for me. You need to expand

262
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,800
the audience, not preach to the converted. So my constructive comment is version 2.0,

263
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,480
bum rush discharge. You've got expand in your audience, not preaching to the converted patting everyone

264
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,160
on their back. You need to get that 1% who download a 100 million iPods out there to 5%.

265
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,920
Then I think you've moved the needle. It's about customers. So not to criticize it, but

266
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,040
constructive comment. And last thing. All right. So first of all, I don't take that as criticism.

267
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,800
I think you're you're right in in many regards. I'll let you finish. I see you've got like nine

268
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,280
seconds left. So whatever you have to say is gone. Oh, why do my ass? Since you always like my ass

269
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,520
on the radio show after I'm done. Why if you're asking me to talk about scrunching and holding.

270
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,000
Cheers. Do keep calling. Okay. Whatever you do, don't

271
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,320
stop and don't turn nice on me. But that last comment you made makes a lot of sense to me. I did

272
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,160
some thinking yesterday. I do my best thinking in three places. One is in the bathroom.

273
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:19,240
Dirling my morning break, which consists of the financial times. I take no technology with me

274
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,600
into the into the smallest room in the house. And by the way, we have a special room just for me,

275
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,000
which is off to the back of the pantry. So it's a and it's nicely heated and I've got my

276
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,960
ash tray in there. Because of course, you know, I have to have my morning tea and perhaps

277
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,200
something else to get my brain going. And, you know, I'll just sit there and I take a long time,

278
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,640
and like half an hour type of guy. I love it and I'll read the two sections of the paper that

279
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,800
I enjoy reading the most and I take the rest upstairs. So that's one place where I do a lot of

280
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:56,520
great thinking. I'm always inspired. I love the newspaper. I really do. In the shower is another

281
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,600
place where I just can completely zone out as if hypnotize, as if back in the womb. And the third

282
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,920
place is actually when I go to bed. When I close my eyes, I'll usually cement a problem in there.

283
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,080
I don't know if it's healthier not to do this, but I'll cement a problem into my mind or

284
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,280
something that I want to work out. And then often in the morning, the brain is done the work.

285
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,880
During the night and it all becomes very, very clear. Maybe the brain has already done the work.

286
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,160
It just has to sort it all out and put it into perspective so that my consciousness can

287
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:33,320
take note of it and act on it. So bummer us the charts version 2.0. I think should

288
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,520
become something completely different. What? In hindsight, looking at this, we used iTunes as

289
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:45,960
a validation mechanism, and really very difficult to validate against mainstream media. Obviously,

290
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,280
we want customers to, and when you call customers, what I call audience, to feel that they have

291
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,960
this power, to see how to use it, which works through posting things on web logs and calling in,

292
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,080
writing into your favorite podcast and using your my space to propagate the message, just really

293
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,560
the concept of the unlabel. What we have not had, and we have a lot of really good things,

294
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:13,320
though the massively important piece that we have is the pod save music network that allows access

295
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:20,680
to the free and clear MP3 tracks for producers of shows to use and the reporting mechanism,

296
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:26,760
the reporting back because that gives us a social media network. You find a song, you like,

297
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,520
you see what other shows who played the song, you're likely to find another song that you will

298
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:37,240
also like that that same show played. Also, we can compile charts. The sea dog is one of the

299
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:44,200
many people who do a pod save music countdown. So this is all extremely important in like a parallel

300
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:51,560
music industry universe. So what we're missing really is the accepted and approved. It's the

301
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,200
same thing, no matter what new media always comes down to a certain point, you have to be able to

302
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,840
compare it to traditional media. It's unfortunate, we'll get to other types of metrics, but we do

303
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:11,320
need to have this and the iTunes charts are obviously used a lot as as a means of justification

304
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,280
or proof. Regardless, we don't even know how the iTunes charts are put together. So here's the idea

305
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,360
because we've been talking to app as we being pod show. This is what I'd like to do. I don't know

306
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,120
what else is going to do with bum rushed the charts. I don't own it. We've been talking for

307
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:32,760
man over a year now, at least, about what we can do with iTunes music store and the pod save

308
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:41,240
music network. And I think I've finally got it. What we need to do is to enable, let me step back one

309
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,600
second. It's very hard for an individual artist to get their track onto the iTunes music store,

310
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,440
because it's really it's a huge backlog. There's, you know, the iTunes music store team isn't,

311
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:59,880
you know, isn't huge. And what they much rather prefers taking a weekly upload from aggregators

312
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,120
and these aggregators are, of course, record companies and a few other and independent labels.

313
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,160
There are a couple of these aggregators. So the concept for me would be to become an aggregator.

314
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:15,720
You get your song onto the iTunes music store by uploading your track, basically, with all the

315
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,480
appropriate information to the pod save music network. So a lot of you have already done that.

316
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,360
So all you have to do then is just tick a box, which says, yes, make this eligible for purchase

317
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:34,200
through the iTunes music store. Now, here comes the tricky part. What I'd, so the concept here is

318
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,440
that we use the purchase of these songs as, as the metric that they're traditionally used for,

319
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:49,000
in other words, we link, if you want to buy a track, and this is, it's very, very tricky,

320
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,120
because we already have a purchase function on pod save music network. If you want to buy a track,

321
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,440
and you want to have your vote counted through this, quote, official thing, which will be through

322
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,680
the, you know, the official metric that Apple uses for all of their purchase data,

323
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,440
then you'll be shuddled over to the pod save music to the, to the iTunes music store, your iTunes

324
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,640
pop open, you'll buy the track. I'm still happy to pass on all the money. I don't need to take

325
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,120
any money from the artist. The iTunes is already taking money, just like the credit card companies

326
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,160
take money if you buy it through the PMN. And then we should also enable you to automatically

327
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,080
download the, the MP3 version. Maybe it's an email with a link to it or something like that. You know,

328
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,720
if you buy it, then, you know, the whole concept is that you should be able to have that MP3

329
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,200
free and clear of DRM. So we kind of sort that issue out. Then what we have, literally,

330
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,320
is a bum rush the charts chart, which is open for anybody. So,

331
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,320
even if you don't have a podcast, if you just want to, if you're just turning people onto this piece

332
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,000
of music, this track or this artist, you can use a link, send them over there, depending on how many

333
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,920
people download, whatever the magic sauce of the calculation is. It'll rise in the charts when

334
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,600
it rises in the charts. That's when people get excited. You try to make it go higher in the chart,

335
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,800
and then there's really another tier. You know, you could break into the overall iTunes top 100 chart.

336
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,560
You understand what I'm saying? So this chart would only be of songs purchased through iTunes

337
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:19,880
that are affiliated with the pod safe music network. I hope I'm explaining this properly because

338
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,160
it's starting to gel in, in my head. And we're going to have a meeting this week and see if we

339
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,560
can get this going because it makes a lot of sense. It will be, it's almost like an independent chart.

340
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,360
I just had to shut up for a second there as the satellite listeners dropped off.

341
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:44,680
Hmm. So this chart would be only to be manipulated or changed by people purchasing tracks.

342
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,600
So essentially, you can start your own bum brush because it'll move the needle on our own chart

343
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,840
and from our own chart, of course, there's many other places it can go.

344
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,920
Does it place us as a second tier? No, I see it as a parallel.

345
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:05,880
But we're coming in as an whole industry as a label that has as an unlabel that has no interest

346
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:13,480
in the in the sales of the music. But does have an interest in making all this content available

347
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,880
and being able to produce, you know, a real network effect based upon a reward system, which is,

348
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,520
hey, look at that. It moved up. So of course, the sales are going to be much lower than, you know,

349
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,520
the mainstream efforts just because, well, we're learning how to use our network.

350
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,520
So that's why we have to have a separate chart. Something like that.

351
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:40,840
Hey, you know what I haven't done in a while? I haven't, uh, I haven't done a proper go daddy commercial

352
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:47,240
but, oh, let me, uh, you like this track? I found on the pod saying music network.

353
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,440
Let me just open this up.

354
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,480
I think it's Dan from Creepy Sleepy who, uh, who gave me this, uh,

355
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,040
just this regular read. He really thought about it too. So I'll provide the music and he'll provide, uh,

356
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,080
oh, it's like lyrics and music.

357
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:50,440
It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it

358
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,600
is like, it's like, yeah, that's right.

359
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:02,220
But that's right, and if you use, uh, uh, I wish I knew the creepy sleeping code.

360
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,460
Well, my code is dsc3go onto creepy sleeping.com.

361
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,640
Find out what this code is and use that.

362
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,660
And he'll get a little bonus.

363
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,960
And you'll get a bonus discount.

364
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,420
That's fun the way that works.

365
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,520
So those of you wondering what's going on with the free Trinity project, I'll

366
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,620
tell you our um, We can New York and in London.

367
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:27,080
Interestingly enough resulted in some very serious interest to a sponsor the project so I'm kind of in limbo because if we get sponsoring in

368
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,080
And it's a whole different approach I'd like to take

369
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Both with sending some finances on to save the world, but more importantly, we could really do something with the production

370
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I've kept everybody in limbo

371
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,640
Kind of like in irons, if you will, I'm sorry about that

372
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,460
Particular apologies go to Barbara the polo Alto podcast, who's just also been kind of like sitting still waiting for me to

373
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,580
To go left or right. It is going to happen

374
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,020
I just want to give it another week or two

375
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,980
To see if we can

376
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,980
Up the ante a little bit so to speak

377
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,740
Remember it's all about independence and true human relationships

378
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,100
Jeff you got that. I'm gonna order a jingle pack as pretty soon

379
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,980
And of course this program has with many shows on the

380
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:21,660
Pot show podcast network has brought to you in part by folders the gourmet blends of coffee to be nicely combined

381
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,620
With the splendor splendor with the splendor splendor what's your flavor

382
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:34,420
My forgetting something. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, I got to get Patricia up here. She had the only reason I want to get her on the show so she can

383
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,060
Do a spot for me for

384
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,020
Tylenol PM

385
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,860
Which is sponsoring Angie B's show on wine dot pod show dot com

386
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,340
Another interesting comment. I've been going back and forth with this guy for quite a while

387
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,580
We're supposed to hook up for an interview. I didn't really want to cloud the free Trinity

388
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,780
vibe with what he was coming in with but it is so interesting to me

389
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:07,580
And it's a real tin foil hat type of moment. So here it is Adam right Adam's here. You know the guy that wants to build backyard atomic engines

390
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:13,140
Okay, it sounds like shit. What's going on? It's a run out run atoms. I think it is and

391
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,180
He's completely into backyard atomic energy. I got to tell you that's tough does turn me on

392
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,420
It's wanted to call and say how much I enjoyed your last two-board Friday show

393
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:28,460
I think you have it about right the great thing about new media is it's a playing field that's then leveled a bit

394
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,900
By the wide open unconstrained access to the internet provides

395
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:42,060
Sure bum rest of charts was display of power the goal was to show the old guard that they no longer have as much controlled over the distribution channels as they once did

396
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:49,820
As time goes on the battle be a little bit more about talent and passion and about ownership of the scarce resource like radio airtime

397
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:55,460
How absolutely I'm all the way with you there buddy. I'm a big fan of independent action

398
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,940
I've been working for about a decade and a half as an indie atomic engine designer and builder

399
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,740
Our system is all about independence from control by oil exporters coal suppliers

400
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,620
large equipment manufacturers and gas pipelines with

401
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,780
1950s inches technology. I once steamed around the ocean completely divorced from the grid from months of the time

402
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:23,580
With current technology we think we have a way forward that will demystify and democratize atomic energy

403
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,140
You've said that you do not want to get into the atomic controversy or is that

404
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:35,580
Controversy it's controversy the topic is important in a world with constrained fossil fuel energy supplies and a growing

405
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:42,860
Understanding that air pollution just might be damaging the planet's ability to sustain human civilization as we know it

406
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,860
Just imagine some day in the not too distant future

407
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,940
It might be a clean emissions free reliable moderately priced

408
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,900
Adams engine supplying a new pod so data bar

409
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,900
Hey, dude. I'm totally into it. I'm totally interested

410
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,980
And you know that that there's a huge

411
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,020
pile of money that is being invested in this sector if you really got something let's talk about it

412
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,580
I can certainly make the right introductions for you

413
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:19,220
But if you please send in in some more info and do something about the recording quality because that was absolute crap

414
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,500
I don't know what you're using you can if you're not gonna do more than 10 minutes

415
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,180
Won't just go to casplash.com and download the free version. You can use that

416
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,540
Tell me what does need it what what has to be done? What are the the raw materials? Is it safe?

417
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:38,260
I mean these are all the questions. What about the the nuclear waste? You know that's the kind of stuff we get here to know

418
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:47,540
Remember these guys that came on to the network about month ago the brand new heavies all fired up from the pod save music network

419
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,660
on TSC

420
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,660
7

421
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,220
We've

422
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,660
I'm gonna try to grab the look at you

423
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,660
So I'm gonna grab the look at you

424
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,660
I'm gonna try to grab the look at you

425
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,660
I gotta see what's in front of you

426
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,660
Set it free and lose the moment

427
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,660
You expect me to stay

428
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,660
Unless we just got caught up

429
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:16,660
In the game of love

430
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,660
Take a look

431
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,660
We just learned a page in the love

432
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,660
As we look and we get dead

433
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,660
We're happy there

434
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,660
We gotta try to find out

435
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,660
Bye for now

436
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,660
We gotta build this thing

437
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,660
To let's be the love of love

438
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,660
Oh, the sky

439
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,660
Oh, baby

440
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,660
Oh, the sky

441
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Oh, the sky

442
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,660
Watch me see

443
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,660
Oh, the sky

444
00:33:46,660 --> 00:34:00,660
Oh, the sky

445
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Oh, what's in front of you

446
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,660
Haw, the sky

447
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Oh, the sky

448
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,660
Oh, the sky

449
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,660
Oh, the sky

450
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,660
Oh, the sky

451
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,660
Oh, the sky

452
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:35,660
Oh, fight up, you gotta try, fall up

453
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,660
Try, fall up, fall up

454
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:48,660
Try, fall up, fall up

455
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,660
Try, fall up

456
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Try, fall up

457
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:19,660
Try, fall up

458
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,660
Try, fall up

459
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,660
Try, fall up

460
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,660
Try, fall up

461
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:37,660
Try, fall up

462
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:42,660
Try, fall up

463
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,660
