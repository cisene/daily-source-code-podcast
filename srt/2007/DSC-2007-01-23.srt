00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I present Padshal's poet laureate Melvin P. LeBeth.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Broses are ready. My sweater is beige. For your domain name needs, you should go to this page. GoDaddy.com.

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, this is Governor Arnold. I am here to talk to you with the great people of this state of California.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is a message that stealing cable and internet is wrong. It is against the law. If you are caught, you will be terminated.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There are only two reasons you should be stealing cable or internet access. If for some reason you cannot get quality movies like Terminator, come and do.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Twins, Kindergarten Cup, all of those are acceptable reasons to steal cable TV.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And if you are producing the daily source code, then you can steal someone's internet access. But only long enough to release the daily source code 530.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
An atom, I'll be back.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:45,000

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,280
30. But I had the juice once again. I really liked the way the show yesterday turned out,

65
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,640
so I figured I'd give it another shot. I'm a little bit more tired today because it was a very

66
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,560
hectic day. And I think I have a bit of a sniffles. All of that just came on like at the very

67
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,360
end of the day. God, I hope I didn't pick something up. That's the last thing I want. But it was yeah,

68
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,600
a day wrought with hectic back and forth to be quite honest, preparing for the shoot of

69
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,440
new show that we're doing tomorrow, we're shooting with Natalie Delcante. At the office, we were

70
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,040
setting that up. I had to come back to the condo between one and three. I had to be here to meet the

71
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:33,080
calm cast guy to take a look at the at the connectivity. And you know what it's like, right? I mean,

72
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:41,320
this is my nightmare. I had shades of the sky installation guy again. I'm running out the door 10 minutes

73
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,880
to one, which I should be able to make the condo no problem in 10 minutes. And I'm on a conference call.

74
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,400
I literally walked by the conference room where a meeting was taking place and I was on the conference

75
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:00,120
phone. And I walked out and so I'm on this call and then I got a call waiting. I see it's an

76
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,800
unidentified number. And I don't even think about it. Because you know, I just normally don't answer

77
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,320
what is it? A block number is that we call it in the states. I don't answer that.

78
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,760
And another three minutes, I'm like, oh crap. Oh, you know that was that was like the guy

79
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,080
calling to see if I was home. Because they said you have to be home between you at the hour specified.

80
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,200
But if you missed the call 10 minutes before when they call you and they don't get an answer,

81
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,880
oh, then they just might go to their next job. And sometimes you can wind up with a cancel job number,

82
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:38,040
whatever it is, job ticket. And indeed, it was him calling. So, you know, I'm running to the condo.

83
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,200
I'm standing downstairs. I'm calling. I'm trying to get him on a line. And yeah, so I took another

84
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,720
30 minutes, but he finally got there. He came up, couldn't find it. Working on it for two and a

85
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,640
half hour straight. And I was like taking meetings here. We got Greg Milk from the weakest beat

86
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,880
talking about his video show, doing that here with Moody. And this guy's just rummaging around.

87
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,920
You know, the couches are all astrue. And he could not figure it out. I told him, I said,

88
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,440
look, man, somewhere there's something's misconnected disconnected. Ah, the longer that, well,

89
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,200
the longer the shorter it is, he didn't fix it. He walks out the door. Literally. And of course,

90
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,080
you know, I'd cleaned everything up. I'd cleaned up the Wi-Fi router and everything in the hallway with my

91
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,400
multi, uh, my multi Wi-Fi relay station, which involve the eye Mac and the linksis.

92
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,280
And he walks out. And all of a sudden, I see the T, I had put the TV on one of the channels that it

93
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,160
wouldn't receive. And all of a sudden, flips on. And all of a sudden, the modem light comes on.

94
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,560
I'm like, oh, no. And of course, the guy's gone. I can't get into the closet anymore.

95
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,800
So, I'm now using another link system. It seems, I'm just going to knock on wood. It seems like it

96
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:57,000
fixed itself. But anyway, he's coming back tomorrow. It's at 730. And uh, and hopefully it'll still be

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,440
running by then. And maybe he just jiggered something the right way. It seems wrong that it's something

98
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,720
that it happens that way. But lots of comments from you guys, lots of explanations about this

99
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,240
tinfoil hat moment that I had to including this. Adam Mike from Baker-Sfield, California.

100
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,680
I think the items that you were describing in the telco closet, it's called a 66 block.

101
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,800
So we call that harness. Still interested standard. There you go. 66 blocks. Take care.

102
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:33,320
Hey, ladies. He doesn't even sound like like a hot telco guy. You know, he was just the

103
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,560
right kind of butt crack. Listen to this voice. Adam Mike from Baker-Sfield, tell him Mike. I'm

104
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,360
a, I think the, uh, I'm a telephone repairman. Adam's that you were describing in the telco closet,

105
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,800
yeah, called a 66 block. Okay, man. 66 block. No, what I'm saying.

106
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,400
That's what we call that harness. Mm-hmm. That's what we call that harness.

107
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,960
Hey, baby. I got a 66 block over here. My harness. And it's just standard. Mm-hmm. There you go.

108
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:05,720
66 blocks. Take care. I love it when I have more time to prep the show. When I can actually

109
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,400
listen to the comments before I play. And so I can set that up. Um, you know, I had all that,

110
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,120
I was doing all that weird routing and stuff. And of course, you can expect the one and only

111
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,040
prolific programmer to call in with some suggestions about the routing tables. Hi, Adam.

112
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,080
Well, because I'm right here from San Francisco. I just came home the other day. But, uh,

113
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:34,920
I went to a Muslim DSC. Five two nine. That's about 21 meets and three seconds on the clock.

114
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,040
Um, once we're at, you know, about your DNS, you don't need to actually configure a DNS.

115
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:49,560
If you have all your clients have their own DNS clashing, then they can just come off the roots of

116
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,320
either way, whatever you I speak in. I've done that. And therefore, everyone comes here. Doesn't need to,

117
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,280
I don't need to convince you. I don't know if you can get a deep on social host. That's all.

118
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,640
You know, DNS talk has always turned me on prolific programmer. So I appreciate you calling in.

119
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:16,040
And I just spent a second on it. The problem is the thing, you know, I was getting, I was sharing

120
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:22,360
the internet from the airport on the ethernet of the iMac. And I didn't really have an ethernet

121
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,000
network to connect to the only way I could do it was by, um, faking kind of, you know, making the,

122
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,880
the linksis think it was just a router. But actually routing between the, uh, it's ethernet

123
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:42,760
channels, I guess, what you call it, and, and it's wireless channels. Um, and, and so you can't actually get,

124
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:50,440
you can get DHCP assigned, but then you're not on the same network as it was, I can explain.

125
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Anyway, I wound up with one network was 192.168.1.4. And the wireless side of the linksis was

126
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:14,360
198.192.1186.2.4. And so I had to make a static IP on the .1.4 network in order for it all to fit.

127
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,920
And so that meant it wasn't serving up IP addresses through DHCP. And therefore, I used a,

128
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,320
a separate domain name server.

129
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,160
By the way, before I forget, I really want to thank Marcus Couch again. I, there was something

130
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:39,080
more I wanted to say. Marcus has a new episode out of a podshow music rewind episode 52 hosted by

131
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:45,800
Jack from Get Jack. And he says it's kicking ass lately. The show's been doing great. 40 music podcasters

132
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,880
contributing. And he's got some other stuff in the works. He's, I love him, man. And his wife,

133
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:58,600
they're awesome. Excuse me. Uh, since Theo, I was speaking of which, uh, email from

134
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,160
Karen Schmidt, hi at him. Chest cold and funky voice prevented me from calling. I ordered

135
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,400
mocha flavored splender from Amazon and got the shipment this week. Immediately, I fired up

136
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,840
the sense, say, oh, met a cup of coffee. I put milk in it and put in a packet of splender. It was

137
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,600
like drinking a foamy hot chocolate. Mm, totally awesome. Good luck with the move. I love forward

138
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,040
listening to the charity for a long time to come. Karen in Virginia. He asks folder. Mm,

139
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:30,360
calling Karen when you feel better. Please. The voicemail, the volume has been so incredibly low.

140
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,200
You know, it's since all the best of Charlie's, I guess, everyone kind of got out of the funk.

141
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,800
Let me play you the, the number. So it's embedded in your brain.

142
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:48,440
I'm sorry. I'm sick of that. Oh, man, believe me, that hurt me just as much as it hurt you.

143
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,360
I'm so sorry about that. Let's try it again.

144
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:58,120
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven, one, two, one, six, three, five, seven,

145
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:07,880
last one, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven. Yeah, all right, sorry.

146
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,120
Let's see what else happened. We did some, so we got the Natalie shoot ready.

147
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,600
Oh, it worked on our channels for Tvo. I think we're coming out with five channels on Tvo.

148
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,360
It's going to be a lot of fun because the producers that we work with and we'll be able to pump a lot of

149
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,640
shows through this. I think it's in a way, analogous to what we're doing with serious.

150
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:39,320
So I'm pretty excited about that. The reach is reason, I don't, I think it's the number of boxes

151
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,960
that have this capability, I was like close to half a million, I think. So it's definitely an

152
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:53,800
interesting channel, distribution channel. And we have to physically deliver a different type of

153
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:01,320
file to them. I'm thinking it's MP2, I'm not sure. So it's going to be a lot of work involved.

154
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,320
I mean, it's the same thing with serious. We take it from MP3 and then it goes to,

155
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:11,240
that I think they have an MP2 special kind of code deck and they compress the crap out of it.

156
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,360
If you're listening to this show on serious right now, in that satellite technology great with

157
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:28,440
the AM sound, that's how they get all those channels on. Okay, so what was I going to say?

158
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:36,280
I don't know, oh yeah, the Tvo thing, right? And I got a lot of feedback about Trinity. A lot of

159
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:43,400
offers to, you know, hey, I'll take Trinity right off your hands, no problem. I really want to give

160
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,560
her away. I'm thinking I want to do a combination of, first of all, I'm going to get it fixed.

161
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,400
I think the way we'll do it is, I would love if, I mean, it's not really a fair promotion

162
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,720
because it would only work for the states, you know, I could provide a ticket fee to fly out

163
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,000
and then pick the car up and drive it back or something like that. I wanted to be a real prize

164
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:12,920
and the car will work presumably. Yeah, I don't know, so I got to come up with the right

165
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,520
from most. Let's work on that. Let's come up with a great giveaway. Something just for just

166
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,520
for daily source code listeners, not a network wide thing, just for people who have been stuck

167
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,800
with the Trinity concept for as long as it would physically last. Let me know, Adam at podshow.com.

168
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,920
Hi, Adam, it's Rowley from the Dark Compass podcast. Just let you know that I've just started my

169
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:41,160
third year on podcasting and I have been dragged by my hair into BT Podshow by your talent

170
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,120
scouts and I'm loving every second of it. So thanks for letting me join your illustrious teams

171
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,640
and hope to talk to you soon. Bye.

172
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:58,680
Music coming from the UK and around the world, splattered with some new tunes from the Podshow

173
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,400
music network and something to laugh about in my own inevitable style.

174
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,000
Hi, this is Chris Jugginson and you're listening to me right here on Dark Compass.

175
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,640
Hi, this is Jade Leary and you're listening to England's Voice of Reason.

176
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:18,440
But we're bringing role parents, something like a 12 inch mix. What is a week without role?

177
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,440
Dark Compass.com. Our talent scouts dragged you by the hair, right?

178
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:34,680
Well, I have another show that joined BT Podshow.com. This is great. It's really exciting to witness

179
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,000
almost exactly the same process that we witnessed in the States when we started,

180
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,120
as we're witnessing now with BT Podshow. And it's the same excitement. I'm really jazzed about it.

181
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:55,160
Particularly when you hear this next. Let me just play this for you. It's unbelievable.

182
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:06,760
Hi, my name is Karen and I'm your chai-rise queen at chai-rise.btpocho.com.

183
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:17,640
I wanted to talk dirty and what could be dirtier than numbers. How many people listen to you show?

184
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:25,720
When I started, my audience grew from one to thirty over eighty shows.

185
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:36,440
Then I moved over to Podshow. And in the first month, the audience jumped to six hundred plus.

186
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:45,560
And in the second, to over eleven hundred. And the numbers continue to swell.

187
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:55,000
Where else can you get hit? Like that? BT Podshow. Are you coming?

188
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:05,960
I love it. Oh my goodness. I gotta get that show. I gotta get it on my tablet.

189
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:15,800
Which is turning out to be a really great iPod, the way many of us have envisioned a mobile

190
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,800
podcasting device. Check this out. The home screen of this device has widgets and you can

191
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,760
configure them. You can say I want the clock and I want the clock here. It's very much like widgets on

192
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:34,280
your Mac or what was the Windows version that was not the Windows version. Can you remember?

193
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,080
Confibrillator. That's it. Confibrillator widgets. It was confibrillator for Windows 2, I think.

194
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,040
After a while. So it's very much like that. Not as pretty of course. That's typical. But that's,

195
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:53,960
that's not far off, I guess, if we have enough people involved. So there's what else is there.

196
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,320
I'd like status bars and things. And there's an RSS reader that comes with a device.

197
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:06,760
And I've subscribed to my channel from my collection on PodShow Plus. So I have an on the

198
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:13,160
go channel. And in this channel, I've got New York Times, some CNN podcast. New York Times from

199
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:21,240
page that is, I've got a couple of my favorite PodShow podcast. I'm Pacifico's the hell way

200
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,840
is in there. You know, stuff that when I'm either walking to the office, I can listen to some

201
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:32,120
shorter ones or if I'm riding to the UK office on the train, then a PCH is perfect for that.

202
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,720
And in this feed reader, it has a widget on the home page. And when you, you can see the

203
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,600
story show up and you click on it, then it opens up the full blown interface, which is still pretty

204
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:50,520
small on the N800. But it had, it even displays the little icon, the little PodShow headphone

205
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,760
head. And so what I've discovered is, and this thing updates every 30 minutes, it does it

206
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,520
through a known Wi-Fi connection. So that's either here at the office or other places where

207
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,120
I've, you know, it's set up a, where I've accessed the Wi-Fi before or through my cell phones.

208
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,640
So it's always getting the most, you know, the most recent version of the feed. And what I find

209
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,480
myself doing is, you know, just before I leave, I look at it and say, oh, let me see, okay, here's

210
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,320
two shows I want and I just click on them and it's a save and you save it. And if you're on the Wi-Fi,

211
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,920
it's put, you know, that goes pretty quick. At least it does, it does now. And then you can take

212
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,360
them on your walk. So it really is pretty much that dream device almost, you know, wherever I'm

213
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:40,440
near Wi-Fi spot, it's like my iPod filling station. Very cool. And, you know, and it's kind of like an

214
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:49,560
oversized iPod. There you go. Okay, I wanted to talk just briefly at this point about the

215
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:55,880
controversy going on in the United Kingdom. And I'm really kind of bummed that I'm not there

216
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,120
right now that I wasn't able to see the past week of big brother, celebrity big brother,

217
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:08,280
because this sparked off a huge, huge media frenzy in the UK. And I totally saw this coming and

218
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,360
just wish I was there. Let me give you a little bit of background for those of you who are

219
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,920
not familiar. Well, you're probably familiar with big brother and the concept of celebrity big brother.

220
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:26,200
The celebrities in the house, Leo Sayer, a dirt Benedict based from 18, Germaine Jackson,

221
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:37,400
Julio, I forgot her last name, Milf, Shoot, who else is in there. How a mannequin, remember.

222
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:45,720
Okay, Shilpa Shetty, she's a Bollywood starlet. Actually quite a quite a successful actress,

223
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,360
at least according to Wikipedia. She's been in the business for 14 years. I think kind of a personal

224
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,280
challenge for her this as well. She's always been in exactly the right movies.

225
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:06,600
At least that's what I read. And a winner of the regular big brother show from two years ago,

226
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:13,640
I think, two and a half, three years ago, Jade Goodie. And Jade, and in the UK, it's fantastic

227
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,000
how these things can happen. It's very easy. It's not very easy, but there are a number of

228
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:28,040
people just famous for being famous without any real entertainment related talent. And Jade was

229
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,440
exactly that. I think very aspirational because she became a star. And then you write a book.

230
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,840
And then the UK, you sell them million copies pretty easy of a book. She had a perfume and it

231
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,160
works. And I think she was kind of a hero of a very large group of women, most likely.

232
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:54,840
But, I don't think there's any way you can be delicate about a conversation like this.

233
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:02,040
But I think in the US would be considered trash, trailer trash. And in fact, in the UK,

234
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:11,320
maybe they would call her chavey. No, I don't know. But there's still a lot of class differences

235
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,800
that are quite clear in the United Kingdom. And that's just historical. And that's not really

236
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:25,480
what the issue is here. So, oh yeah, there was also a girlfriend of a soccer player,

237
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,440
what they would call in the UK a wag, as in wives and girlfriends. So, kind of like, you know,

238
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:39,320
someone you might expect, posh byst to hang out with. But of course, she actually has hung out

239
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,160
with Jade Goody. I didn't mind even going through all this. She hung out with Jade Goody for about a

240
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,920
year, because, you know, they're of the same ill, I guess. So, anyway, so there's always a lot going on.

241
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,280
And what's happening now with with with big brother is we're seeing some things. It's become

242
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,640
such human nature to be on the in in these types of situations, even for people who,

243
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,800
you know, even for people who have never been in that situation to do a reality show. I mean,

244
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,680
our culture is changing around us. This is just happening. And we're also interpreting this data

245
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,880
when we watch it on television, in a very different way. And we're also forgetting things,

246
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,400
namely that it's on television. And lots of things that are said in a 24 hour situation with

247
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,680
cameras on a full time are not said with the knowledge of, hey, this is actually something I'm

248
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:33,720
saying to a rather large audience. Interestingly enough, the audience numbers were somewhat

249
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,560
down around the three millions. And I think the best, the best big brother episodes or series

250
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,720
have all been between the six and the eight million, which is a pretty decent size audience for

251
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,080
the UK. So, there's numbers happen to be down. And there was some some fireworks and some stuff

252
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,720
going on. And if you're listening to this on serious stars 102, I'm so sorry. You can have to

253
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,360
download the podcast at dailysourceco.com to hear the rest. So,

254
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,520
I shouldn't try to be slick, because then I lose my train of thought.

255
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,600
Okay, so there's, there's some misunderstandings in the house.

256
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:22,520
Shilpa Shetty is Indian. And she speaks impeccable English with, I would say, a pretty typical

257
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,440
Indian accent. And she's been the one that's cooking and she's been making stuff that she

258
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,120
that she wanted to eat, which is more than likely culturally different and different in many ways

259
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:43,240
than from what Jade and Danielle, the wag. Oh, that. What they're used to eating.

260
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,040
And anyway, so what happens is that they get into bickering fights. I've been in this house for like,

261
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,200
15 days. And they're going nuts. There's just a lot of shit going on. And these two girls

262
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,960
Jade Goodie and, and also Joe from, what does she, what's she from S club seven or so? I mean,

263
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:05,320
just three peas in a pot, I would say. You know, they're talking trash and they're talking

264
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,320
behind her back and they're saying nasty things and they're making fun of the way she talks. And,

265
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,560
and, you know, I can't even, I don't even want to paraphrase, let alone try and get the exact

266
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,280
quotes. It doesn't matter. It's the way people often talk when they're not being viewed by millions

267
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:28,280
and millions across Britain. And so, of course, this catches fire, you know, slow newsweek,

268
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,840
right? Of course, there's no one dying in Iraq anywhere. There's no bombs going off. So,

269
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,480
you know, let's make a big deal out of this. But it got all the way up to,

270
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,240
was it Gordon Brown, I think, made comments. He said, you know,

271
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,760
I mean, so here's the debate. People were saying, oh, the show should be taken off the air.

272
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,600
She should be evicted. Well, it boiled to a point where Jade Goodie, so this is the world who

273
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,520
came from nowhere, became a superstar thanks to Big Brother. Now, with an overwhelming 86% of the

274
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:05,240
vote has been evicted from the Big Brother house. And she, her life is as good as destroyed by

275
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,920
Big Brother, of course, which I guess, in a way, is all of us. And she's gone and I've talked

276
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,240
to Patricia, so I only know this second hand, but she's going on every chat show that she can.

277
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,160
And this tears are flowing. And she says, oh, now that I see the tapes, it's so horrible,

278
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:26,680
I'm exactly the, I was behaved exactly like the kind of person I love. And so that, so I had to give

279
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,360
you that background otherwise it makes no sense. Because it is an important point that I want to

280
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,120
make with, with what's happening with the way media is injected into our lives and how we view it.

281
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:47,320
And what we think is real and not real. And what I heard on Big Brother, I hear all the time

282
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:55,240
in the UK, all the time. And I wouldn't say, I wouldn't go so far to say, I hear racism all the time,

283
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:03,960
but well, here's what I hear most commonly. Oh, I don't mind foreigners, but I wish they could

284
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:11,240
speak English. If only they would speak English, boy, they can't speak English. What are they doing here?

285
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,960
And that, of course, is a very dangerous route of something, but there's no denying it. And Patricia,

286
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,360
I have noticed this for the past two and a half years. We hear this a lot and we're pretty amazed.

287
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,440
You know, you come into a country fresh and also you start to pick up a little bit of things,

288
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,080
you know, and everyone hates Tony Blair. I mean, everybody I talked to hates him. I mean, really

289
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:39,480
angry with him. And I hear this a lot about foreigners. Now, don't forget, if you look at the

290
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,440
history of the United Kingdom, and they have paranoid about rabies for a thousand years,

291
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,120
and it is an island, you know, and for some reason, well, for lots of reasons, I guess, there's a

292
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:56,200
culture of maybe we should call it protectionism or nationalism, but it's not really racism.

293
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:05,400
And then some of the words may be inappropriate. You know, when you make fun of someone's accent,

294
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,120
and I got to admit, I find myself doing it, too. You know, we'll be sitting there watching

295
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,720
big brother. And the show, a show by Shetty, she's stunningly beautiful. She's incredibly smart,

296
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:23,160
very well-spoken, just beautiful. But you can't just help yourself, you know, when we're sitting

297
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:30,200
on the couch and we'll be like, oh, I can't even do it. I feel so bad. I can't even do it.

298
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:36,440
I feel horrible. But you know, you do it. And I don't get offended. It's funny, because I don't

299
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:43,080
get offended when Brits do an American accent. You know, and it's the same thing, totally taking

300
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:49,320
the piss out of everything that, you know, is Yankee Doodle, Dandy Impression, you know, and

301
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,040
we do the same thing about Brits, particularly about the way people, so you talk funny, it's funny.

302
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:02,280
That's why they call it talking funny. But what I'm a little worried about is that this conversation

303
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,200
is not going to be held, that Pete, you know, that, oh, you know what, we're just going to vote

304
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,960
Jade Goodie off. We're going to, you know, destroy her, and she was a really, you know, channel all of

305
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,800
our bad, bad thoughts, and our guilt onto this girl. I'm no fan of her. I told you that,

306
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:25,640
I do not like no talents on television thinking that they got talent, you know, and maybe it's

307
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,760
my own, maybe it's a fatherly instinct. Like, get away, you're going to get hurt, you know, one day

308
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,520
you're going to wake up and you know, you're going to realize you have no talent for this job,

309
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:39,960
and it's going to really, really, really suck. And so she's meeting that, you know, she literally

310
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:47,720
met her maker, but I feel bad because the debate, the discussion can be over. There is

311
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,200
this culture in Britain, and it's all, you know, and it's in different countries for different

312
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,360
reasons. I saw this in the Netherlands throughout the years, first it was the Italians, and then it

313
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:03,240
was, and I had it myself in 1972, you know, I looked funny, I talked funny, I come from the America,

314
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,320
the dollar was worth five gilders, you know, was an extremely powerful rich country,

315
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:17,000
yeah, man, the kids would beat me up. You crazy American, that's what they would always say.

316
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,160
You know, it was a weird time people didn't like Americans there, and but it wasn't racism,

317
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,560
it was just, you know, fucking kids, you know, when you talk funny, you look funny, and I'm going

318
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:35,800
to go beat your ass. I'm not trying to say that, you know, any of that's right, but let's have the

319
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,280
conversation about what we really think and what we really feel and guess what, we could have a

320
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:47,160
really intelligent conversation with everyone around the table, because, you know, unlike other

321
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,280
countries in the continent, there actually is quite an amazing amount of integration that's gone

322
00:31:52,280 --> 00:32:00,120
on and Britain, certainly the hub around London is multicultural, and I think a damn good multicultural

323
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:08,600
society. I'm not living there for no reason. It's expensive. How, but of course, expensive keeps the

324
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:15,960
riff raf out. You know, we don't want any of the poor near us. Anyway, so, um, I don't know,

325
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,680
I wish I was in the UK, so I could follow it a little bit more closely, but I heard the BBC this

326
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:28,360
morning. I, uh, that's another one on my on my go channel, uh, the BBC a breakfast, um, which is video,

327
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,680
and it's highlights from the, from the morning news. Oh, I love it. This podcasting shit. It's really

328
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,520
good. Anyway, in line with all that, I want to play a song. This is what I talked about the other

329
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,760
day. The song from, uh, that I picked up off of the weekend edition of I Love The Company,

330
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,640
David Epilito. I think it's the lovely Lisa. I mean, you could check out his site. She's got pictures

331
00:32:45,640 --> 00:33:00,120
of his co-host. I think she's his girlfriend now. I LTC.podshow.com. So, he played a song by, uh, I'm sorry.

332
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,520
I'm totally spacing Schwartz. It's it. What's the first name? Uh, uh,

333
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:13,080
Schwartz. Okay. I'll look it up while I'm playing the song. I'm sorry. It's a little late for me.

334
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,680
And this is the same guy that did, uh, Clinton got a blowjob, which I also played on, uh, on the show.

335
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:27,560
So, this is not on the podcast music network, but it's so incredible. And go out and buy it.

336
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:33,960
If it's on iTunes, I looked all over his site. I couldn't find it. It's kind of long. It fits well

337
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,520
with this whole discussion. Oh, I'm doing it.

338
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:27,560
Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

339
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:52,840
af uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh維

340
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:03,160
to the station. You're pointing with the broomstick as a standard operation and thought

341
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:10,960
you'd hide your violence. Behind that big blue wall of silence but and now you're

342
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,160
rumored with some of the bitches you've been rumored. I applaud the situation but I wouldn't

343
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:26,120
take a bow. Just tell me officer, a houda bitch now, whoa yeah I won't you tell me

344
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:38,440
