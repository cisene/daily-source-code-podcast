00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Greetings, Adam. This is Dr. Lancaster. We have something extra special for you for the

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,160
DSC-610. My group has been studying unique birds in West Virginia and we've found

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,160
the current enjoyable. On the endangered species list for years, it's an amazing bird, a bright

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,440
yellow battery, we've found one of the tree sitting in front of us. Perhaps you can hear

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,880
listen most of the other birds at the unit call. It's amazing bird.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,880
What? Hey, did it get it? Was that a little yellow bird over there? Did it get it? What is that

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,280
quail? That was a cutlass well. A cutlass well, but it's a, it's a, well, it has a taste.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,320
Now it's a bird on the endangered species list. I don't know about no danger, it's dead.

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,320
You can't understand, it's very rare. That's right, I just, I just cook it a little long.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,560
I just don't, can I borrow your gun for one moment, please? Well, sure what you would see

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,240
an element when you wouldn't get, hey, hey, wait a minute, why are you putting that thing at me?

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,400
Oh, I don't know, buddy, I don't know. You see, sometimes Adam, you have to text,

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,400
matters into your own hands when you're dealing with someone who doesn't quite understand what

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,720
you're doing. Now while I'm on a roll, if there are any radio executives around here,

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:22,040
with $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio content

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,280
in my ears. I like to think I'm flying into the future.

17
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,120
I know that I still do what happens I won't do. I'm flying into the future, I just have it all by,

18
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:58,680
and I get high. So I can say stop at least into my mind, but I think I never really thought to

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,320
new people, but I thought you might like to know. We never really thought to new people, but to my

20
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:17,000
sorrows show up, preach about so, track it to you, woman, damn the day I only won't buy a gun.

21
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,160
And the dream that the change in me, do your feet just like I do,

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,320
me, then you turn as well, she says, it's because you're right with you, oh, oh, oh,

23
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:44,120
Tuesday's five with me, say, say it over again Tuesday's five with me, say it over again Tuesday's five with me,

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:03,800
say it over again, say it over again, say it over again, say it over again, say it over again, smile

25
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,800
I never didn't stop but never left you out of my mind

26
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Never really thought to knew people but I thought you might like to know

27
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Never really thought to knew people but to my sorrow shall I

28
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Two days find it with me say

29
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Say it over and two days find it with me say

30
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Say it over and two days find it with me say

31
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Say it over and two days find it with me say

32
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Be it me before, and let your wife stop

33
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,300
Say it over and you've turned wr

34
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Say it over and two days found it with me say

35
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Say it over and two days find it with me say

36
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,800
All right, with you, I love you.

37
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Two days, five with me, say.

38
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Say it over again, two days, five with me, say.

39
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Say it over again, two days, five with me, say.

40
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Say it over again, two days, five with me.

41
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,800
You know, how can you resist when you find a fire eight song

42
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
that has two days in it.

43
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
You find it on a Tuesday, Tuesday is fine,

44
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
and it's just perfect for episode six hundred and ten of the

45
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,800
daily source code coming to you from the curry manner,

46
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
west side of Guilford.

47
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

48
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
It is Tuesday, obviously.

49
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,800
And I'm late, because today was almost like a job day.

50
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Patricia and I both had to be in London.

51
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,800
She was working on something that I'm not allowed to tell you about.

52
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
You know, maybe next week she'll tell you come on the show

53
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
and tell you yourself.

54
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
And I saw I tagged along for that,

55
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
and so I had, you know, just general stuff.

56
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
I had to do this morning.

57
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
I'll have you know that I finished the admin.

58
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
I had simplified my life so well,

59
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,800
and no matter how little comes into this house through the mailbox.

60
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Actually, I'm amazed at how much it is.

61
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,800
And you gotta open this stuff, because it's like,

62
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
it's like the email obsession, you know,

63
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
you're gonna miss stuff.

64
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
And boy, did I?

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Let's see.

66
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
They were about to turn off the gas about the same company.

67
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,800
So the British gas was about to turn off the electricity.

68
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,800
The council was going to have me arrested for being behind

69
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
uncounseled tax.

70
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Yeah, you know, it was only only three things.

71
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
I kind of messed up.

72
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
But at least I got there right under the wire under the on the nick of time.

73
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
In the nick of time.

74
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Yeah, I had a quick lunch with the super agent Keith.

75
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,800
He's gonna be working on some stuff for us here in the UK.

76
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Basically getting some, yeah, getting some ink and some press on on the network

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
and shows.

78
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
And he's a crazy guy.

79
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,800
He's come up with some interesting strategies, which,

80
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,800
oh, man, once I'm back, I'll be able to tell you more about

81
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
because yes, I'm gonna go to San Francisco.

82
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,800
No, I'm sorry to New York next week following on to San Francisco

83
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
and I'll be out there for a week and then come back.

84
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,800
So I know, and it's just the way things are going.

85
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
And there's so many cool things happening at the same time.

86
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Just like being thrown around like a sack of potatoes around the world.

87
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
But I've been home for a while.

88
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
So I'll be pumped up for it.

89
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I got some interesting, well, not just feedback,

90
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
but interesting slew thing.

91
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,800
You know, whenever there's something I wonder about on the show,

92
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
someone will usually find out.

93
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Hello, my name is Michael.

94
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
I'm from Bristol.

95
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
There are songs to listen to.

96
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Yes, he's 6-0-9.

97
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Almost towards the end of it now.

98
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
There are songs from the film.

99
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Hello, we in Halloween.

100
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
I think it will season up the witch.

101
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Three more days to Halloween.

102
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Hello, we in Halloween.

103
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Three more days to Halloween.

104
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Warden.

105
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Zero, Sam Rock, if I cover some kind of masks on the head.

106
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
And the year I did, was it was a chip or something into the bucket of things.

107
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,800
We'll have from stone heads, rock, it was stone, and I know yeah.

108
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
And it was triggered on there.

109
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
It was like a doomsday film, when that...

110
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
No, come on, let's insert this film.

111
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
I've never listened to the other two Halloween film.

112
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,800
No, but I like that idea of using Mass Media,

113
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,800
or using some form of distribution to trigger people's minds.

114
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
You know, I mean, that shit.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
That's it. I love it.

116
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Do you think it was going to ask you?

117
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,800
What if that actually is happening with Trinity?

118
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
You done the free Trinity thing.

119
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
That seems to have gone quite an over the year.

120
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
There was a lot of logistics involved,

121
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
but we don't see that much about that for months.

122
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
If you still got Trinity,

123
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
I was Trinity being solved.

124
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Is it on Great List?

125
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it.

126
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Two, three.

127
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Thanks.

128
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Yeah, man.

129
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Well, I'm going back to San Francisco

130
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
so finally I can get something done.

131
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
How hollow does that promise sound to you?

132
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Ha ha ha ha.

133
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Just don't love me.

134
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
You know, put on the mask and you won't go.

135
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Kill me.

136
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,800
There are lots of people writing in from Germany

137
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,800
in an anticipation of Pod Show coming to Germany.

138
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Alexander, by the way.

139
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Alexander Almoff. He emails me a lot.

140
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
I'm not quite sure what his deal is.

141
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,800
He's on the inside with like military.

142
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
He's like someone under deep.

143
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
He's like deep throat in.

144
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
He knows everything about what's going on with the government.

145
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
And he's interesting.

146
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I think he might be a savant actually.

147
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Adam, not all German speaking, which that well.

148
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Okay, this is a reference to me saying I thought that the Germans

149
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,800
that I met and spoken was very well.

150
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,800
After World War II, Germans divided two parts east and west.

151
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Yeah, okay, I get that.

152
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
All right, so of course the east didn't have as much

153
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
access. I understand that.

154
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
And interesting.

155
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Interestingly, he says, recording.

156
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Regarding Pod Show in Germany.

157
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
I'm already speaking like a recording.

158
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Pod Show in Germany.

159
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
You should definitely go to Berlin.

160
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
And not a lot of people are recommending Berlin.

161
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I think that,

162
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Cologne has the, has the upper hand right now.

163
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Great city Berlin.

164
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Great public transport.

165
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Great airports in the city and close to the city.

166
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Also air Berlin flies to almost all the major cities in Germany.

167
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
If you have to go to other cities.

168
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Sony Center would be the best location.

169
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Hmm.

170
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,800
Okay.

171
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
I know I have to go look at all these,

172
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
where all these spots are on the map.

173
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,800
We have a, a frapper map or something with all the good.

174
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Well, actually, that would be, there must be a German frapper map.

175
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Isn't that so we can see where with the highest concentration

176
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,800
is of producers.

177
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Might be something.

178
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,800
And Johannes says Cologne would be the perfect location

179
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
for the German ponchoage queue.

180
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Very big and all kinds of media.

181
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
And it's a very, very nice city, which is often described as

182
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Italy's northern most city.

183
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I like the sound of that.

184
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Italy's northern most city.

185
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Yeah, that's nice.

186
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Comic strip.

187
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Comic strip.

188
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Comic strip.

189
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Comic strip.

190
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Comic strip.

191
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
How the Adam.

192
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Here is CSB from comics to blog.com.

193
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,800
So you mentioned serious radio on your latest podcast.

194
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,800
But, oh, that was in reference to no cameras and saying

195
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
that serious sucks less than an accident.

196
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Yeah, okay.

197
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,800
I have a feeling that you never really managed to deal with this

198
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
tactic.

199
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,800
In my view, you were not mean to think with other serious presenters

200
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
enough.

201
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
You know, there's something to that CSB.

202
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Not that it has any influence on us not continuing with our deal.

203
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,800
But I have to agree that there was a very difficult to kind of integrate with

204
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,800
the other channels and then with the other shows because not all of them were

205
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,800
actually from New York and, you know, we were definitely West Coast based.

206
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:25,800
So I also, I'll agree, but I have to say, I was promised that they would arrange

207
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,800
for a spot on Stern as well as on Jay Thomas's show.

208
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Because I did listen to your advice to CSB, but I guess either they didn't ask or

209
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
we just got turned down and they were afraid to tell us.

210
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,800
And we should have given interviews and evangelized podcasting by the way.

211
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Well, of course.

212
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Jay Thomas, my path, and how I'd stand.

213
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,800
And also, your show on series was playing too much of potential horrors instead of the best

214
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
of hope on the sphere.

215
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
I need to do it.

216
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Go get your own satellite deal.

217
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Then if it would mean playing case and the blow job podcast.

218
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Adam, I kind of ask you, please talk to serious folks to bring.

219
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,800
You know, I think we asked them one time if we could run their show on series and they declined.

220
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,800
So, what can I tell you?

221
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
I like the name though, the way you describe it.

222
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Thought showing podcasting back to serious.

223
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Please, we'd make one on top.

224
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Go back to serious.

225
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
You know.

226
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,800
On May 29th, unwind with Angie B.

227
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,800
We'll present an artist spotlight on love spirals and love spirals down here.

228
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,800
A lot of it has to do with time.

229
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,800
That was where I was in the 90s with the low spirals downhorns.

230
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,800
And low spirals is where I am at now.

231
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
And with Angie, a whole different person.

232
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Band founder and my musical partner, Ryan Lomb, joined me in the studio to discuss the band's

233
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,800
16-year history during one of the most revolutionary periods in music history.

234
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,800
And I just amazed, like, wow, you could get all the songs on your computer.

235
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
You could, like, move the tracks around, it blew my mind.

236
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
I already knew what I wanted to do.

237
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
I wanted to, like, produce an studio.

238
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
I just didn't have access to that technology.

239
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Now, anyway, goodbye and Apple and have Garage Band built in.

240
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Plus, the world debut of a brand new track from upcoming third album.

241
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Check it out and unwind.podshow.com.

242
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
And, uh, unwindies.

243
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Wow, vintage bars brought to you by Tyler and all PM.

244
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Probably presented by.

245
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Yeah, I can't believe that this past me by.

246
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Yeah, I'm so, sometimes, this is so much going on.

247
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,800
I cannot believe that I've missed two new tracks by the Louis Vuitties.

248
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
You know, they've probably sent me email.

249
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,800
And I probably have just, it's gone past the queue and I've not seen it.

250
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,800
And you know that, for me, these girls really were the,

251
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
well, they were it.

252
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,800
They were part of the spark that led to the pod save music network and the pod save music license.

253
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Actually, I should tell you that story because I don't know when the last time

254
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,800
is that I did talk about it, but before anything was called pod casting,

255
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,800
I've, they had somehow stumbled across one of their MP3s on their,

256
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,800
on one of their sites somewhere and it was the song famous.

257
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,800
And I really liked it and I sent them an email.

258
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,800
I said, could I please play this on, on my show?

259
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Calling it a show at the time.

260
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
And they said, yeah, no problem.

261
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,800
And, uh, and I did and other people who were doing these,

262
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,800
what we now know as pod cast heard it and they would also send off an email to the,

263
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,800
to the, to the, to the biddies and you know, I'd given the email address or whatever,

264
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
and then they get permission to play it.

265
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Um, and after a while the biddies got in touch with me and said,

266
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,800
you know, we're actually like selling more product because of whatever you guys are doing apparently.

267
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,800
And, and then, you know, it was so, so clear, you know, we need to make it simple for,

268
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:00,800
um, the artists to give out the license, the, you know, a particular use of their music,

269
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,800
without all this emailing back and forth and then put in the, hey, I'm reporting it.

270
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Um, that I actually played it and please, I do hope you report when you use music from the pod same music network.

271
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,800
And, um, so that, you know, that really sparked it all and then, uh, well,

272
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,800
long story, uh, fast forward.

273
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,800
We've got, uh, you know, I mean, how many artists do we have on this thing?

274
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,800
I think we have probably about 60,000 tracks from, I don't know if it's 18 or 19,

275
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,800
maybe over 20,000 artists now, I should check as you get those stats.

276
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Doesn't matter. It's all good stuff. It's all good.

277
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Now, um, they have a new album coming out or it's, I haven't seen it yet.

278
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
So I guess it's on the way. It's called Love You Mean It.

279
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,800
And, you know, and that, you can see a picture of one of those candy hearts.

280
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,800
And this is one of my favorite expressions. So right there, they've stolen my heart once again.

281
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Love You Mean It. You know, that's kind of like a thing that we did in, you know, the 80's post breakfast club.

282
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Um, and then there's two, uh, oh, a second.

283
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Um, it's a two new tracks, uh, last night in Shelburne.

284
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,800
And then this one, and I swear to God, they wrote this about me or for me.

285
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,800
It's just, it's me. I know it. I'm absolutely sure.

286
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,800
And even, uh, they don't even have to tell me it's true.

287
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Because I know that they wrote this song about me and I love them for it.

288
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Odd Bird. Here's a list of his bitties.

289
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Love You Mean It.

290
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:37,800
You're one of the weirdest people I've met.

291
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Strangest duck in the pond.

292
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Oddest Bird in the nest.

293
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,800
How did I get?

294
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,800
I got it.

295
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
You wear your grandfather's pants.

296
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,800
With ties that are much too bold.

297
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Yet you walk with a bounce in your step.

298
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Oh, oblivious.

299
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Though you may be quirky,

300
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,800
It's strangely working on me.

301
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,800
You make the rest of them wonder.

302
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,800
But you just make me smile.

303
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Like so many other men.

304
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,800
You tell a good dirty junk.

305
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,800
You get drunk now when again.

306
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:53,800
It's not too bad going at you.

307
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
It's no good.

308
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
It's not too bad going at you.

309
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
It's not too bad going at you.

310
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
It's not too bad going at you.

311
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
It's not too bad going at you.

312
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
It's not too bad going at you.

313
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
It's not too bad going at you.

314
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
It's not too bad going at you.

315
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
It's not too bad going at you.

316
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
It's not too bad going at you.

317
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
It's not too bad going at you.

318
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
It's not too bad going at you.

319
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
It's not too bad going at you.

320
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
It's not too bad going at you.

321
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
It's not too bad going at you.

322
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
It's not too bad going at you.

323
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
It's not too bad going at you.

324
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
It's not too bad going at you.

325
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
It's not too bad going at you.

326
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
It's not too bad going at you.

327
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
It's not too bad going at you.

328
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
It's not too bad going at you.

329
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
It's not too bad going at you.

330
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
It's not too bad going at you.

331
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
It's not too bad going at you.

332
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
It's not too bad going at you.

333
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
It's not too bad going at you.

334
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,800
It's not too bad going at you.

335
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
It's not too bad going at you.

336
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800

It's not too bad going at you.

It's not too bad going at you.

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
It's not too bad going at you.

377
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
It's not too bad going at you.

It's not too bad going at you.

380
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
It's not too bad going at you.

It's not too bad going at you.

384
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
It's not too bad going at you.

385
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
It's not too bad going at you.

386
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:13,800
It's not too bad going at you.

387
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Though you may be quirky.

388
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,800
It's strangely working on me.

389
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,800
You make the rest of the wonder.

390
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:38,800
No, you may be worried, just keep on doing that thing.

391
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:50,800
That makes the rest of them wonder, but you just make me smile.

392
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,800
I can't talk to you on the phone.

393
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:11,800
You speak a language all your own, but sometimes I speak it to the time I go.

394
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,800
The lascivious bitties, odd bird, and that is so I just love them.

395
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
I just love it.

396
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
It's a fantastic.

397
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
You'll find it on the Potship Music Network.

398
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
You'll find it at Potship.com slash music.

399
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
You can search for it.

400
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Of course, go to datingsourcecode.com, click on the link.

401
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
It'll take you right to their page.

402
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,800
And girls, I want you to know that I have had at least one sexual dream about every single one of you.

403
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,800
And sometimes two of you were in the same dream.

404
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Adam, maybe a good idea.

405
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Next time, you do a sound sightseeing tour.

406
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Sound seeing tour on the plane to upload or show an AAC format, including pictures.

407
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Don't picture.

408
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Next time, space music, I'll make you the AAC field.

409
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Okay.

410
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,800
But the reason I pull out the emails, because his P.S.

411
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
This is from a SNNTC space music.

412
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
I quit smoking too after I heard you quit.

413
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
That is cool.

414
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Thank you.

415
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,800
How many other people try to give it up or just give it a go?

416
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,800
When you heard me talking about, I bet there was more out there.

417
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
And it's a bitch.

418
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Damn, it's a bitch.

419
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Let me tell you, let me just tell you that it's what's so messed up about it.

420
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,800
I love mixing my, you know, my weed with tobacco.

421
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,800
And you can perfectly self-medicate yourself throughout the day.

422
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,800
You can't do that now, because if you smoke that stuff pure, I'll be standing on my head all day long.

423
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
I've worked to do.

424
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I got stuff to do.

425
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,800
I just can't be lethargic, so I can't smoke anything during the entire day.

426
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,800
And until, and this is what really pissing me off, you know, had a long day in the city now.

427
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
It's almost 10 o'clock.

428
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
And I'm like ready for something.

429
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:56,800
But I am definitely over the whole feeling of the nicotine and tobacco.

430
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
I really, really miss sticking something in my mouth.

431
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I really do.

432
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Yeah.

433
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
They'll get any ideas.

434
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Have you heard of this e-sigarette thing?

435
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
It's from Asia.

436
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,800
I think it's from, is it Japan?

437
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:16,800
And it's somehow, it's, it's like a wooden fake cigarette with a little, like, a little LED at the tip.

438
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
And, well, let me look this up.

439
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
I saw this the other day.

440
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Where did I held it?

441
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
I see that.

442
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
This will drive you nuts.

443
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
I've heard a lot of people about this.

444
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,800
E- would it be that simple?

445
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,800
E-sigarette.com.

446
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,800
I think I saw one on, maybe on eBay.

447
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Let me see if e-sigarette.com works on a crap.

448
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
I'll just try.

449
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Now, there it is.

450
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Yeah.

451
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
E-sigarettes.

452
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,800
You notice that in Firefox now, if you use the Google search window in Firefox,

453
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,800
then it starts to give you suggestions as you type a dropdown list.

454
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
That's pretty cool.

455
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Okay, E-sigarettes.

456
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
From the far east.

457
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,800
This will be well worth your while by the time I get to this page.

458
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Believe me.

459
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Because I just want to get it right.

460
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Because it's quite an ingenious little device here.

461
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
Man, these pages are loading slow tonight.

462
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
I bet your Christine is downloading some shit.

463
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Or Patricia for that manner.

464
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
All right.

465
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
We'll see if this loads anyway.

466
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,800
So it actually gives you, like, a fine mist.

467
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
It has a power supply.

468
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,800
I think it has, like, one of those faggy tips.

469
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
You know, there's, like, a French movie director tips.

470
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Filters that you connect to the cigarette.

471
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,800
And so when you inhale, it actually exhales like a fine mist of nicotine.

472
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
I have no idea if nicotine is good or bad for you.

473
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
But I think that's the stuff that makes you feel good.

474
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,800
So the combination is kind of there.

475
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,800
You know, you're sucking on something because that's really what this is all about.

476
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,800
And then you get some of the, some of the nicotine.

477
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
I'll look into it.

478
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
I'll get back to you once this fricking page loads.

479
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Hello, Adam.

480
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
It's Mike here from Bristol England.

481
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Also known as Go Lemon Out of the Lills.

482
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
I've just touched up on me.

483
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
If you can get the C.S. and a car here.

484
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Look at one last week when you're in the other plane.

485
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Do you hear, do you hear in the background?

486
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,800
He's got the love, the moonlight sonata that I played.

487
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
If you have sophisticated that sounds.

488
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,800
Two over 200 years old that song.

489
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
And you just hear the guy with that talking with that in the background.

490
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Already he sounds like James Bond.

491
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Yeah.

492
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Oh, well, I take that back.

493
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Another one of the minutes and other plane, which is on today.

494
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
You said he's D.F.A.C.

495
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Hey question.

496
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,800
I have to be forward about what they didn't want to.

497
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Oh.

498
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Port city P.D.

499
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
P.D.

500
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
P.D.

501
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
P.D.

502
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
P.D.

503
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
P.D.

504
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
P.D.

505
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
P.D.

506
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
P.D.

507
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
P.D.

508
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
P.D.

509
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
P.D.

510
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800

539
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:47,800
The actual day when this show comes out, you know, people who have been following this show so far, they're subscribed, they're getting it automatically.

540
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
And they'll know.

541
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,800
So, you know, and it's like nowhere, is there a podcast to, I don't know if it's many podcasts or if any at all,

542
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:01,800
that say, okay, this show is always available on this day of the week at this time.

543
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,800
You know, it's always going to fluctuate. We don't have to hit the top of the hour news break.

544
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,800
So, that means we can be very flexible at working with the extremely inflexible mainstream media.

545
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:22,800
And when we think we can get a great article or an interview or something that, and of course, we're positioning the final two episodes of the first series.

546
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:31,800
And that will be, well, I shouldn't really announce it, but obviously we'll be timing that with, you know, some great news about a second series coming, perhaps I'm just saying.

547
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,800
What's really great? So, when we, and, you know, we're pretty close now.

548
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:43,800
In order to maximize our investment, we're trying to time the release of the episode to some news that we can generate around it.

549
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,800
And it's really cool that we can work that way because it's completely the opposite of the way traditional media has to do it.

550
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:57,800
But, you know, so in that case, yeah, it's taken us a little bit longer, but it's also, it production took a little bit longer as well.

551
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:06,800
And I think, and this is something that we are planning for the second series, should we complete that deal on, should we be announcing that?

552
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:17,800
It used to do companion episodes, just like, like Scottsigler does, like Mark Yoshimaru Namcoff does, you know, and to have that interwoven with the episodes.

553
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,800
And we've learned so much, I tell you, we've learned so much.

554
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:28,800
All right, I got to cut this a little bit short, so let me see. I can do, uh, and I have two more comments. I'll save those for tomorrow.

555
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,800
I will have a regular day regular show and back here at the man or not going anywhere.

556
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
And, uh, so there's two more fun things to talk about.

557
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Please visit the suck less zone to help pod show suck less. It's important.

558
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,800
I really would urge you if you're a listener of this show.

559
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Or any other, uh, any podcast, really, because this data that we are, um, trying to aggregate is going to be used to make.

560
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Our programming better, our network better, uh, all the podcasts that are participating in it, which are thousands.

561
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Um, are also, you know, they're getting the same data. They'll be able to understand what else they can do with their audience.

562
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:13,800
And if we're really good, then, uh, we'll be able to make more money, which helps a lot of people trying to make a business out of this.

563
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,800
God, that sounded so fucking commercial. I just, just love myself now.

564
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
And this is Nigel's thing, man.

565
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,800
I like these, uh, these remixers, the young punks.

566
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Stuff is getting better.

567
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Norman Kirkdanks.

568
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Okay.

For the next dance, move to the dance floor, take your part to buy the hands, and repeat these moves after me.

Yeah, God, look it and load that and aim for the hearts, spin it and flip it, rewind to the start.

571
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,800

600
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,560

601
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,560

Yeah.

605
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:25,960
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running

607
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,600
I love that mix.

608
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,480
The battery power device is used exactly like a typical harmful cigarette, but rather than delivering

609
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,760
tar and toxins to the lungs along with nicotine, the poisons are stripped away and the

610
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:15,560
doses of nicotine are still provided.

611
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,200
Interestingly, the company claimed it's product is simply the best way to kick the habit,

612
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,560
but if these things can actually do what they claim, honestly it seems like a mark that

613
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,920
we get into and gadget editorial.

614
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:33,680
$200 a piece, $28 a piece, and I'm looking to picture here, and so it's like a cigarette

615
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,560
and it's in one of those filters which is kind of lame, but that's where the battery

616
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,760
powers, that's these leds, these LED, like a red tip, and it's like some kind of gas,

617
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,160
which I guess is the nicotine gas, and that's kind of what you want, you just want, you

618
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,920
want that something to hit the back of your throat.

619
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,440
I can do what I can live through this stoppage.

620
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,920
If you all are with me, you know what I'm saying, I can probably question if you're good.

621
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:07,120
Alright, everybody, dailysourceco.com, Adam at poncho.com tomorrow, we'll see if we could

622
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
get Patricia up here tomorrow.

623
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:14,400
That would be a good change about my sphere, and it'll be, what, day eight, nine, I've

624
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:21,880
lost count, smoke free, fucking love in it, another poncho podcast, stick it in your

625
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,120
sphere.
