music network baby baby you might have heard about them on fly post to our brand new

54
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,900
trans intercontinental office music show flypostor.podshow.com if not

55
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,540
bring it home

56
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:49,780
the show everybody how you doing it's Monday it's going to be another crazy busy week

57
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,620
whether or not too nice today although certainly doable for flying and of course

58
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,420
that's my link to talking about the weekend for the first time and I'm going to say

59
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:04,340
a couple months I had a full two-day weekend where I didn't necessarily have to do any

60
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,900
podshow related business of course that means I have to catch up on a couple things more

61
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,700
because it's stuff that I could have done over the weekend but really took advantage of just

62
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:21,940
of the beautiful weather we had here it was utterly stunning clear skies sun almost no wind

63
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:29,140
which means just perfect perfect conditions temperature was fresh fresh fresh crisp is what I

64
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,580
wanted to say very you know that crispy feeling you get near and on Saturday there was a kind of

65
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:40,820
an ad hoc organized fly in on the island white wind commander William and the number of his clients

66
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,180
actually all who have aircraft that he maintains decided to go hang out and have a quick lunch and

67
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,980
he came in in the this is the next aircraft I want all man hold on let me just adjust my

68
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,700
mic stand here it's I don't know for some reason maybe it's weather related but we started

69
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,900
slipping a little bit there we go maybe if I change the center of gravity there we go that's better

70
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:10,180
he came in in a brand new like a hundred hours on this thing King Air 90 GT which is

71
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,380
I was just salivating that what a fantastic aircraft this has got to be my upgrade

72
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,380
it's about uh 10 times the expense of the current one I have but mm well man if I had some time

73
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,980
to fly it I certainly would so that was great to flying the Delta Sierra down it's only a short

74
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:33,620
flight it's like 20 minutes more or less and I was I was the first one so of course I went in for

75
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,620
the perfect landing thinking those guys would be there at 12 o'clock and I landed like 12 o'clock

76
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,420
three beautiful and there was no one there to see it so the question is did it really happen

77
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,580
um so that was that that was fun you know it was real airplane hangar talk bullshitting about and

78
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,860
then I took off back home had a nice Saturday evening we'll talk about some of Saturday later on

79
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,220
in the show but of course there was the rugby world finals cup that I did watch

80
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:06,500
and as I said we'll talk about that in a little bit then Sunday I convinced my bride to come with me

81
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:13,060
also to the island white to the infamous crab in lobster pub which up until I think two o'clock

82
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,420
in the afternoon they serve the most fantastic crab and lobster dishes it's well known

83
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:25,140
certainly to uh to aviators this is a fantastic destination and so we decided to fly it out

84
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:31,460
and you know I love having the lady Patricia sitting next to me up front it's uh first of all

85
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,540
so much more attractive than the captain Dan or anyone else who's been up front but it was

86
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:42,740
it was great just the two of us beautiful flight you know flew in we took a quick it's like a five

87
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:49,780
minute camera ride from the airfield to uh to the crab and lobster pub we had a great lunch really

88
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:56,340
leisurely took our time sat outside while eating while looking out over at that point basically the ocean

89
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,180
uh as the vantage point where we were sitting and uh and then so I want to told us that we could

90
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,460
actually walk back to the airfield along the cliff right above the beach and so we did that but

91
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,660
it was really nice about a 35 40 minute walk and it was as I said the conditions were great so

92
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:21,700
even though it was cold and you know kind of uh yeah crisp fresh fresh fresh fresh we you know

93
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,100
we kind of warmed up and it was a it was fantastic actually bummed out we didn't bring along the dog

94
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:33,220
as small as he is I'm sure he would have enjoyed that and then departed did a nice circuit all

95
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:39,300
around the aisle of white at low level so about about a thousand feet so we could really you know

96
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,660
get a good look at it and then and then flew home back to pharaohs now this was about three

97
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:51,300
thirty quarter to four and even though the wind was pretty much variable and very very light

98
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,940
uh runway two four was in use now they do the switch this around four clock in the afternoon

99
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,700
and I'll tell you what that is if there's no significant uh wind um because you're coming in

100
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:09,140
basically in a south westernly uh in fact uh in a in a in a westernly uh direction a runway two four

101
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,740
zero so you're flying to that direction which is uh west which of course is directly into the sun

102
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,380
and so often uh obviously at the end of the day if there's no significant wind they'll put

103
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,340
on zero six the other direction so you don't have this sun glaring in your eyes so you know to make

104
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:29,060
this landing uh it's pretty gnarly uh because also there's all kinds of bugs and shit on your

105
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,460
wind shield and void if they look dirty then when the sun is shining directly on it so it took

106
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:38,820
some real uh concentration to land smoothly and it was funny because you know so put it down nice

107
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,940
and smooth you know little plows there from the lady pea and then like wow it was I so concentrated

108
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,140
that my mouth like started to smell like shit and yeah I did one of those are breathing to your hand

109
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,340
things and we're still on the runway right rolling out as we're taxing to vacate the runway

110
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:02,340
I'm like what is that and the smell was so bad it was a really putrid acid acidic like

111
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:08,660
puke smell and uh and so I got on the radio and I said hey man I don't I don't know what's going on

112
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:14,180
but it really really smells bad down here on the runway and the tower came back and said well

113
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:20,420
we've had no other reports so obviously it's you of course it was some kind of manure that

114
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,820
they were putting in the field next door but it was so funny that actually like god man I need

115
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:31,060
to tick that real quick I smell really bad from this landing anyway so uh onto the current order

116
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,340

131
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,500
in Nashville I think it's going really well from what I understand I couldn't be happier and

132
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,540
I'm really bummed that I missed that to recent to pocho sales trip to Nashville because I really

133
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,180
would have liked to check it out but I'm sure that'll happen the future Jeff is back and he's helping

134
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,180
out as usual

135
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,980
both numbers on the website at data source code dark I am curry glenia from Cape Town South Africa and I

136
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,740
must say I'm so proud to be a South African you just have no idea what that must be feeling like

137
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:51,460
right now and I'm sure this clip will make England weep and every South African around the world

138
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:57,940
feel absolutely proud with joy yeah so and so there's like one minute clip that I'm just going to

139
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:04,500
talk over here for a second of the the final I guess final 10 to yeah five to 10 minutes of the world

140
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:12,180
cup rugby which was held in France it was the United Kingdom England I should say versus South Africa

141
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,540
and I watched the whole game we got admit a couple of reasons for that one is of course

142
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:24,020
a jake or Christina's a bow to sure is a rugby player and you know I've been watching a couple

143
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,420
games or a little bit and I've been asking some questions and you know so now I know what a try is

144
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,740
in the line out and of course I do have some knowledge of the game because it's in a way it is similar

145
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:39,060
to the American football that that I've grown up with but it's I think it's a pretty I like the game

146
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:48,580
actually now that I'm understand it's actually pretty dynamic and it doesn't stop every single time you

147
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,700
know it's like whereas in an American football you'd have a down and you have four of those and

148
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,260
then you stop and everyone lines up again of course the ultimate time to go to commercial these

149
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:04,260
guys basically keep the ball in play and I do have to admit I find that pretty compelling it was

150
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,620
fun to watch I understand how the well that's got to mean that's on hold on how uh oh what is this

151
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:15,700
is one the rugby world captain yeah hold on how would you gluten this second you know so I

152
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,020
understand how it try works and then the conversion and how even in those last five minutes England

153
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,420
totally could have pulled a rabbit out of a hat and and won the game which of course makes it you know

154
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,820
that much more exciting but to England lost unfortunately to South Africa of course congratulate the

155
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:36,100
South Africans let me see this is seven in the final last night well I want to give you one little

156
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,260
piece of information about this game as I'm sure that you're being an England who are definitely

157
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,620
have known about this oh yeah definitely would have seen and heard everything South Africa the

158
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:54,580
world champions baby yeah go Bokka woo it was just incredible seeing our president Tom Baky with

159
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,660
these rugby jersey on cheering with the boys celebrating with all right so there was one

160
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:06,900
little bit of controversy in this game um England scored a try which is a touchdown or a goal

161
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,180
or whatever you want to call it now they do have a video a playback on a lot of these uh in

162
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,940
a lot of particularly in rugby in the professional games so they can see if someone might have been

163
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,740
out of bounds and the England player indeed did go out of lines or uh I would they call it

164
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,820
uh we I call it out of bounds maybe they call it uh on the line off the line whatever it is

165
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:32,660
out of bounds out of play essentially uh so the the touchdown or the goal or the try didn't count

166
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,660
now in this type of a game right uh particularly with England supporters

167
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:46,100
if this had been football or soccer it would have we would have had fucking dead people in the stands

168
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,900
and it was quite amazing to me that uh well incredibly disappointing and while all of England was

169
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,060
really pulling for their team and and the supporters and fans were very very enthusiastic there was

170
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:04,340
no rioting you know there was no fans killing each other in the stands it was very sportsmen like

171
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:10,020
and and I did it in fact there's more bloodshed at a rugby match on the field and that's incredible

172
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,100
I saw guys like get their head ripped open and then you know there's like a short uh technical

173
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:19,140
time out while the guy literally gets a bandage wrapped around his head it just continues to play

174
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:25,940
I must say I'm I'm kind of into this game so I'm looking forward to uh to the next season and

175
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:31,940
and rooting for the England team a good job they really tried but uh even I as a novice I felt I could

176
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,700
see that South Africa was was definitely stronger so congratulations to you guys uh well deserved

177
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:45,220
and looking forward to beating your uh as next time I hope hey Adam it's done long time

178
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,660
listener from the west coast of Canada uh just wanted to comment on the DSC672 and the nine

179
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:56,260
long comments um the beard of your show whether it's daily weekly monthly or once in any on

180
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,060
doesn't really matter but uh what you do is even though you do have your own opinion about a lot of

181
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,220
things you throw the stuff out there for us to talk about trust the comments about and you do get a

182
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,300
lot of really good comments and a lot of good feedback back uh the nylon into fucking waste of space

183
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,980
if you're deteriorated to renting and raving and as much as I'd like to say fuck you Adam curry

184
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:22,740
I'm gonna have to give that the nylon's very fuck you nylon just coming out okay by special

185
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,740
permission not a problem yeah I do am enjoying this asynchronous uh you know I call the conversation

186
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,460
you guys call the conversation it's an asynchronous conversation because of course I'm talking

187
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,980
then you're talking and you come in a couple days later and it's uh honestly it's really

188
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,820
difficult to manage this show where I'm moving on the next topics and people who are catching

189
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,220
up are just jumping in with really good stuff but of course it's all appreciated uh hey I'll

190
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,980
play one of those obnoxious voice mill jingles in a moment so you can call in anytime

191
00:18:51,620 --> 00:19:04,980
comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip from Poland by way of Germany here's

192
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,820
our EU correspondent the comic strip blogger hello Adam here's your European Union correspondent

193
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:18,820
so the new EU treaty has been just agreed and it brings EU president and the removes

194
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,900
vetoed right in some viter areas this treaty is necessary because EU has been enlarged and it has

195
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:31,460
the number of parliament members because it's smaller and so on and so on unfortunately due to

196
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:39,460
the new treaty UK wants to quit EU and UK wants just to have only a free trade agreement with EU so

197
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:47,780
I have to say we all are fucked up and please ask your own poll what is his view on USA EU relationships

198
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:56,820
and fuck you very much you're going a little bit out of bounds there CSB don't need any uh it's

199
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:02,100
just FU that's all we need okay yeah of course I will ask Ron Paul that although I'm pretty sure

200
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,340
as answer will be hey we should be trading with the Europeans but we shouldn't be allied with them

201
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,860
as his uh his belief as a constitutionalist which hopefully you've done your homework and you've

202
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,940
been taking a look at the constitution classes I'll put them in the show notes once again today so

203
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,340
you can take a look at that so you can understand where America's coming from a lot of people

204
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,820
assume incorrectly that it's a democracy it is a republic so that's something to bear in mind

205
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,380
learn a little bit today if you have some time at work fuck the boss take some time and read

206
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:37,300
about the constitution yeah we're going to talk about Ron Paul as well in a second and uh I found

207
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:42,500
this on the pod save music network which I just wanted to share with you it's uh and farms worth

208
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:49,060
there's a couple songs up there it's just awesome for like a Sunday afternoon or maybe a lazy

209
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:56,660
Monday you're laying in bed breakfast in bed a couple of crumbs T-Stayin here there you and your

210
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:01,220
loved one basking in the glow of that early morning subland

211
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,100
come

212
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:55,700
You know, maybe it's not just a nice sunlit Monday morning, maybe it's a bit of a Christmas vibe that I'm feeling.

213
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,020
There's something going on, I can kind of smell the cherries, cinnamon scents in the high

214
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:08,660
students I walk through the high street of Gilford, high appropriately of course.

215
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:15,140
I see things going on in the UK over the weekend, television was dominated again by a news

216
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,100
of the BBC cutbacks, which was interesting to see how the BBC is reporting on its own

217
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:31,220
but also this, I saw this on a couple of weblogs around TVLinks.co.uk.

218
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,220
You might have seen this somewhere, set up by some 26-year-old guy from

219
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:43,620
Cheltenham in the UK, he was arrested. Now the TVLinks.co.uk is a site that I've seen before, I've

220
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,340
used before, there are a couple of sites out there like it. In essence, there are search engine

221
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:54,180
specifically for television programs. So it's just links, links that point to primarily Google

222
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:59,940
videos and YouTube videos and it just kind of organizes episodes. So people who've put up episodes

223
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:06,660
of let me give you an example, Dr. Who is a big one. You know, they've been put up on YouTube

224
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,460
and on Google video and other video sites and TVLinks just basically points to all of

225
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,300
those different places. They are not not storing anything on their server. In essence,

226
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,660
they're doing exactly what Google does. In fact, if you were to look for Dr. Who video on Google

227
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,460
and do a Google search, you'll find it. Actually, now I think about they're not doing exactly

228
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,580
the same. Are they? They're categorizing and listing as opposed to searching. I wonder if that

229
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:37,140
would have made a difference if you could just say, you know, give me everything for Dr. Who and

230
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,700
it then would have formatted a nice output. It may have made a difference, but legally,

231
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:48,900
probably not. I find this very, very interesting. The spokesperson for the Federation against

232
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:56,180
copyright theft known as FACT said, sites such as TVLinks contribute to and profit from copyright

233
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:02,980
infringement by identifying, posting, organizing and indexing links to infringing content found

234
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:10,020
on the internet that users can then view on demand by visiting the easy legal sites. Wow, I hope

235
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:15,620
they, I really hope they don't apply this to my favorite MP3 site, which is seekpod.com.

236
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:22,740
Sierra Echo, Echo, Quebec, Papa Oscar Delta, because man, you can get anything on that. But that's

237
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:29,140
more a search engine where you can create a playlist later versus playlisting itself. But then again,

238
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,980
this is, I don't know, I need a lawyer to check it on this. If you profit, because they're

239
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:43,060
saying that the TVLinks.co.uk profits from copyright infringement by pointing it out.

240
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,260
That's his really tough man. It's really difficult, shit.

241
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:58,260
But sadden on the less. It's, yeah, that's totally beat. Well, I hope that someone can,

242
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,540
can help these guys out because, you know, or let's just figure it out. So we understand what we can and we

243
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:16,900
can't do. Today is also the last day for comments on TSA's secure flight program, the transportation

244
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:25,300
security agency. Let me see, I'll read this kind of verbatim, David Wank. Adam, apologies if you've

245
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:30,260
covered this on DSC, sorry, I'm about six months behind. Dude, forget about it. Just skip up to today.

246
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,660
Going to be really disappointed about a lot of things, particularly this Wednesday. If you're just now

247
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,620
catching up, briefly, the TSA, we've talked about this is proposing a secure flight program, which

248
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,420
threatens to severely curtail individual's freedom to travel by air to the US. Under this program,

249
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,940
all travelers would automatically be obliged to obtain individualized prior permission for all

250
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:57,460
journeys by air to from overflying or even within the USA. And from what I understand, that will be a

251
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:06,260
72 hour period minimum. Now, you can put comment on against, and I'm sure you can do it in

252
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,740
number of ways, but you can also do it online, which is nice. And of course, link in the show notes

253
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:17,620
as expected, a daily source code.com. You need to put your comments in before five o'clock DC

254
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:23,060
time, Washington DC time, today. And there's only like a handful of comments up there right now.

255
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:32,820
Not all of them are really good, but a lot of them focus on individual rights, the individual

256
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:39,300
right to travel. And just in general, this would be so bad for business, so bad for so many people,

257
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:45,460
and really restrictive, and it does not fucking compute at all. So please get that in, if you

258
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,660
want to comment on that, I'm going to put my own comment up there later on today, because I do

259
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:58,100
believe it's bad, it's, you know what, how many times can I say this? If it was only the airlines

260
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,140
that were a threat, okay, I'll be willing to consider if we were under constant threat,

261
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:09,060
but how come we don't have this very same type of security for other places where terrorism has

262
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:18,020
struck. Namely, trains, buses, and tubes. Now the only reason I can find is because it's

263
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:38,820
horseshit and it's meant to terrorize you and restrict you and restrict your freedom.

264
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,100
All right, let's hit the voice mail phone lines for a second, couple more before we get out of here

265
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,740
for today. Hey Adam, oh man, this is killing me. I'm listening to your podcast right now. I'm a new

266
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:54,660
listener. I started listening because somebody from Milan Paul forums told me to go listen and

267
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:01,620
yada yada yada, and I love your show. So now on the stand, see it works both ways. Anyway, listen,

268
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:07,060
it kills me when I hear somebody talking. I know it's not your fault man, but man, it kills me when I

269
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:13,300
hear someone say, Ron Paul's campaign wants you to go to November fifth calm and vote on November fifth,

270
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:19,220
blah, blah, blah. Ron Paul's campaign is nothing to do with that. There's a difference between

271
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:28,180
grassroots campaigning and what the Ron Paul campaign is doing. Okay, so I got a couple of comments

272
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:36,740
about this. In fact, someone sent me an email and said, you know, the Ron Paul campaign is

273
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,060
against this November fifth drive. And the whole idea is kind of a bum rush the charts where

274
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:46,260
you donate money on November fifth to really make the needle move. It was interesting because what

275
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:54,740
and this is a question I'll probably then I guess address with with Dr. Ron is let me see if I can find

276
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:01,860
the exact email that might be a little bit better. Hold on, I know the keyword, so I can

277
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:08,020
easily find it in Gmail. Hold on a second. Bear with me. Come on, Gmail. Do it, baby. Yeah,

278
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:15,140
this is from Chris, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, I think. Just sort of calling

279
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,980
your show about the November fifth fundraiser for Ron Paul. The caller left the impression this

280
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,460
is a product of the official campaign, but they are really not involved at all. Some of the more

281
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,420
conservative people in the grassroots campaign are actually battling against the idea because they

282
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,900
are afraid of the media picking it up and spinning it as Ron Paul supports supporters celebrating

283
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:46,100
terrorism. Huh? How can that be equated to Ron Paul supporting terrorism? I just don't understand

284
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:55,060
it. And quite honestly, I'm really not digging this, you know, grassroots versus official vibe.

285
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:01,700
I think the campaign is everyone, not just the, quote, official campaign. This is what you

286
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,900
guys are flying on. So if that's the organic root that that and I will call it the campaign,

287
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,540
grassroots official or otherwise, if that's the root that the campaign is taking, you need to let that,

288
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:16,740
this is this is how you've cracked the code of the internet, okay? This is how Dr. Ron Paul

289
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,900
is going to is making a lot of waves and we'll make many more because the internet is rolling out

290
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,220
and it's on the loose and this kind of stuff happens. Now, if someone can really explain to me why

291
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:32,340
that this could be equated to the candidate sponsoring or supporting terrorism, please let me know

292
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,420
because that would be a serious consideration. But I can only see this being a great thing for the

293
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:42,980
media to pick up on, you know, it shows true power. Look what we did with, um, bum rush the charge for

294
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:49,380
Christ's sex. Sorry, there was no reason for me to take Jesus Christ's name,

295
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:55,860
invade in that particular statement. For fuck's sake, okay? Now there's one other thing that I have

296
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:03,300
serious serious concerns about. Before real is about the way that the money is going to be spent

297
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,620
that is being raised. And of course, I would presume after a key, you know, staff is paid and

298
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:14,980
expenses are paid, which I know this campaign is keeping very, very low and there's lots of volunteers.

299
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,220
And of course, you need full-time staffers and people have to be able to eat even though they just

300
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:26,340
believe in a cause. Please, look at podcasting and independent media. I, but I'm not digging the,

301
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,260
uh, the way the money is being spent. Now that it's being spent on advertising, but the kind of

302
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:36,740
advertising, someone sent me an official radio ad for Dr. Ron Paul. Have a listen to this. What are the

303
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,500
so-called Republican front runners for President support? Amnesty for illegal aliens, like liberals?

304
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:48,740
How to control spending? Like the Democrats? Nation building overseas? Wasn't that bill Clinton's policy?

305
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:54,580
Flip flopping on the issues? What's Republican about any of that? The real Republican is Ron Paul.

306
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:59,860
The Republicans are losing because they did not keep their promise to end big government at home

307
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:05,780
and nation building overseas. My record is different. Yes, Ron Paul's record is different.

308
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,900
Ron Paul is never voted for a tax increase or an unbalanced budget. Ron Paul voted against

309
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:16,740
Amnesty for illegal aliens. Ron Paul voted against nation building overseas. Ron Paul

310
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,300
photos the Constitution, not the lawyers, not the lobbyists, not the latest poll.

311
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:27,540
Learn more about Ron Paul. The real Republican running for President, go to RonPaul2008.com.

312
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:33,540
That's Ron Paul2008.com. This is Ron Paul, candidate for President, and I approve this message

313
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:40,260
before by Ron Paul2008, PCC. All right, I hate this. This is a crap commercial. I hate it.

314
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,540
It is so incredibly opposite what the, what the entire message has been. This is

315
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:51,300
going into the mainstream with the same stupid fucking message as everybody else.

316
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:59,060
I didn't do this. I didn't do that. I'm like, I'm not like those guys. Who gives a shit?

317
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:03,540
What I want to hear is the catch phrases. Where's the Google Ron Paul? Want to know more?

318
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:09,300
Google Ron Paul. That's what I want to hear. Want to know what Ron Paul's all about. Read this

319
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,940
little book. It's easy to read. It's called the Constitution. That's the kind of message that

320
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,980
the campaign needs to be getting out. I will not donate any money. I will not support it.

321
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,380
This is what it's going to be spent on. Who the Frick is running the advertising over there?

322
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:31,380
We've got this incredible movement. We've got thousands of YouTube videos, all kinds of

323
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,180
slogans, support statements, initiatives. And this is the advertising that comes out of it. It's

324
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:48,260
despicable. It's traditional. It is not the message. And it is lame. Capital L, lame.

325
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:56,660
Now, man, I need any, what agency did you guys hire to do this? Fire them. They suck. They do not

326
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:01,940
know what you're talking about. And your supporters are actually creating this, you know, it sounds

327
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:07,860
like I've had this meeting. I've had this meeting. I have it with advertisers every single day.

328
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:16,500
Every day. I said, this, it's independent media is where you are going to sell your next billion

329
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:23,540
dollars worth of products. And you need to conform to a new message. You're not limited to 30 seconds.

330
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,300
Okay. So mainstream, you're limited to 30 seconds. But why does that have to be the same

331
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:37,460
message that everyone else does? I'm coughing up my guts. Oh, no. Very disappointing. Very,

332
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:44,660
disappointing. So now, you know me, I'm not just a complainer. Well, I love complaining. But I'm not

333
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:50,100
just a complainer. I'm a doer. And I know that many of you out there in what I have to say is a vastly

334
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:56,980
growing audience. Ever since this political conversation started, the numbers are out of control. So

335
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:02,100
welcome everyone who's a new listener. Create, you create a spot. Make it 30 seconds. Make it the

336
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,420
message of Ron Paul. I'll submit these to. I'll play them for them. I'm going to have them on

337
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,100
the phone on Wednesday. I'm going to play. I'm going to say, don't you think this is the better commercial?

338
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:16,820
You know, and you know what people will do it for a fraction of the cost of whoever is dreaming

339
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:24,260
this shit up for you. They'll probably do it for free and look at the diversity of content that you

340
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:33,940
can have to promote what you're doing. But this, oh, no. Just nasty. I'm sure many of you agree,

341
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:42,980
but don't just agree. Make a better one. Okay, promise? Thank you. Hey Adam. This is Andy from Oakland.

342
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:52,020
I'm just listening to today's source of listening to your sisters recording and responding to it

343
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:57,460
and about Ron Paul. She says, well, what about abortions? You have to travel to another state to

344
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:03,060
get an abortion. You said, yeah, so what? Well, that's great. If you're rich, if you can afford to go to

345
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:08,900
another state and think about it, so you're essentially saying services and abortions and other things

346
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:14,100
are fine for rich people, people in your category, maybe in my category. What about people who can't

347
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:19,300
afford it? And that's really unthinking. Think through some of these issues before you just sign

348
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,580
on blindly. All right. Goodbye. All right. So the reason I play this comment is because I got a lot of

349
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:31,940
very similar ones. And I just want to make my understanding clear that it's really a multipart issue.

350
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:39,860
So one is the freedom of choice. Now, of course, you have the right to your body. I believe you have

351
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:44,660
the right to put anything into that body. You want to take anything out of it. Do whatever you want

352
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,980
with your own body, as long as you don't hurt someone else. Of course, there's a whole major

353
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,860
point of contention there. But it's still, it's my body. If there's another body and that has some

354
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,740
rights, it's inside my body. Okay. And I get to choose over what's inside my body. Let's just say,

355
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:05,140
I'm stating that clearly. So that doesn't matter if your man, woman, I think child,

356
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,420
animal for that manner. I guess. I don't know if they have right. They don't have human rights.

357
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:16,740
They've animal rights. Let's not go down that route. Any man or woman has that inalienable

358
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:25,700
right. Now, the problem is healthcare has become outrageously expensive because of the system that

359
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:31,380
has been set up. I think I've been through this before. But essentially, when you create a system

360
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:37,540
where a large number of people are relying on, let's call Medicare or centralized healthcare or

361
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,180
the national health service or whatever all these different schemas are in different countries,

362
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:47,300
essentially it's centralized medical care. What happens is the price is automatically go up and the

363
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:52,740
drug companies are in this scam and the hospitals are in this scam. And there's, you know, there's price

364
00:38:52,740 --> 00:39:00,900
setting. And when you have a contract with the government, it's very easy to to, to, to, to over time

365
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:08,260
come up with enormous fees. Who was telling me the other day that their daughter was born prematurely

366
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:13,940
and they didn't have health coverage and the, the bill for several months of incubation time and

367
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:19,460
all kinds of procedures was half a million dollars. There's lots of rich people who can't afford that

368
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:27,540
either, half a million dollars. But is it really, is it really that expensive? Do doctors necessarily

369
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:34,900
have to be rich guys driving BMWs and porches and, and having beautiful expensive homes and

370
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:40,740
going on vacation and golfing and having a wonderful rich life? Is that why they became doctors? No,

371
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,580
why are those fees so high? Well, they've been artificially created that high by the market place.

372
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,860
But the marketplace effectively controlled by the government. And you can kind of see where there's

373
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:57,460
a lot of room for crap that goes on in that system because it's now you're not negotiating as

374
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,340
negotiating as individuals, but as government government has all kinds of agendas, there's all kinds of

375
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:08,260
I mean, all of it, what is it? E Street or D Street or Astrid or Crap Street and D.C. We're all the

376
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:13,860
lobbyists are that's where these prices are jacked up. And that is because of the incorrect construction

377
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,420
of government and entitlements and centralized care. So it's really two issues.

378
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:29,540
You know, because the I think what Roe versus Wade is also about is about the government paying for

379
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:36,900
said abortion. Well, of course, this type of care should be available, it should be affordable to

380
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:43,300
anyone or some form of insurance should be affordable to anyone because the price of the services

381
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:48,340
and the medications involved have to be affordable and they're not. That's the most jacked up

382
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:54,500
industry there is. So please, you know, don't think that I'm trying to make this a world for wealthy

383
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:02,580
people only. I also, honestly, I don't think Dr. Ron Paul has a shot at becoming president.

384
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:09,060
You know, for a number of reasons, the main one being that he's a Republican and he will not run

385
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:15,140
independently if he's not nominated for the Republican candidacy. Quite honestly, his ideas are so

386
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:23,060
back to grassroots and in many traditional eyes today seen as so radical that he'll never make that.

387
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:29,940
I don't think it will happen. It would be miraculous and I it can and it would be wonderful if

388
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:36,500
it did. But I think what he's really doing is he's starting up a wave and this wave is growing

389
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:42,980
in this wave is extremely important and it's a lot of it's about rights, about privileges,

390
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:48,980
about property, about the Constitution and its subsequent amendments and that's a conversation

391
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,380
that needs to proliferate and what I believe will happen as we get closer and we have a whole

392
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,220
year to go. There's so much that can happen and I'm not going to be talking about this for a whole year.

393
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,460
Although we should be talking about a lot, you know, I believe that maybe one of the other

394
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,860
Republican candidates will see that this thing that is cracking the code of the internet through

395
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:13,220
the simplicity of freedom, which is very popular and the Constitution of the United States of America,

396
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,980
that other candidates will pick up on this and we just might get someone else who will change

397
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:25,780
their tune a little bit. Excuse me. So obviously this is not the end of the conversation, but please

398
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:33,940
don't think that these things are not exclusive. They go hand in hand. You can't just say,

399
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:42,100
all right, that's it and not fix the medical care situation. I believe that Dr. Ron as a physician

400
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:49,380
by the way has never ever accepted a Medicare payment because he is opposed to that system and has

401
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:57,460
done a lot of procedures for free or at a decent cost. I don't have the documentation on it,

402
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:01,780
but that's what I've been led to believe and again great stuff to talk about with him when he

403
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:11,540
comes on this show Wednesday the 24th I think. So somewhere around 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon

404
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:18,820
UK time this will be posted. So that'll be was it around noon or late morning early afternoon

405
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:25,060
in the U.S. And of course that'll be on Saturday down under in the Australian looking for a way to

When I see five really cute girls and they're playing instruments, they get my attention.

426
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,420
From the podcast, music, that word girls don't cry American boy.

They are from New York and you'll find a link to them in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.
