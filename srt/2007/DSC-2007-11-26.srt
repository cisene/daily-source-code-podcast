00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,000

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We can get closer to one and down the whole year.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's snoop a little bit.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Keep it off for brand new week of shows.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If you're from the Curry Condo and Georgia, California,

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
come to you from San Francisco.

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There's a very source code episode number 692.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Nothing like some party bend to get things rocking.

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What do you say?

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's Adam coming to you from the Curry Condo.

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Seems like I was just here.

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In fact, my cleaner, her name is Christina, has not even been here.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's that last left.

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Which kind of sucked, because I walked in, like,

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
doesn't smell very fresh.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Of course, you recall I had a power outage last time I left,

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and I couldn't turn the dishwasher on.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I thought that she would have been here by now, but apparently not.

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So it's a little bit messy.

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Got everything set up here in the studio.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And of course, my microphone stands snapped.

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I have a, I carry around this really heavy Mike stand base

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and a little, you know, little attachment,

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
just a little piece of metal, so that it sticks up a bit.

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Probably about, what is that?

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Like, ten centimeters, something like that.

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, maybe even last, maybe even, like, seven or eight, seven probably.

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And on top of that is a plastic.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
My holder.

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, that snapped off.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So I've just parked the microphone in a towel here on the Baker's rack.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So aesthetically, the studio looks like shit.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But otherwise, doing okay.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hey, really rough travel.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We started off with a problem with the oil cooling

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
in engine number one, I believe, on our 747.

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So we spent almost four hours on the tarmac at London Heathrow.

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
After, actually, I was, I was running a little bit late this morning.

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So I wasn't able to pick up my magazines.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You know, I rushed into the, into the lounge, had a,

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
full English as we call it.

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So that's the big English breakfast with scrambled eggs, toast,

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
beans, a big ass shataki mushroom, a sausage, you know, full English, right?

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
My cappuccino had my, my orange juice, but really had to wolf it down

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
because I only had about 15 minutes before I had to get on the plane.

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And then I walked the wrong way because I was, of course,

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
in the days, it being Sunday morning early.

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And then I walked back the other way.

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I didn't run. I don't run for airplanes anymore.

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I know they got my bag on board.

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
They're not taken off with that bag on board.

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And, you know, got there.

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And then there was still a huge queue.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So it took another half hour before it was actually on the plane.

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And then another three and a half, almost four hours sitting on the tarmac.

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Just a rough flight in general.

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'd say a lot of, a lot of turbulence.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And I did see a couple of good movies.

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Finally saw a hairspray.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Now it was fun.

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
John Travolta.

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I didn't, I'd never even, I'd never seen that any of John Waters work

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
previously.

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I haven't seen the play.

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So I didn't know what the story was about.

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Great story.

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If you haven't seen it, then I won't, I won't tell you because you just had, you just have to go and see it.

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Of course, upon arrival, I have to admit right up front.

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a bit of a chicken shit.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I didn't dare strap on the wireless microphone.

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Because I just, you know, I was like, am I going to get harassed again?

151
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You know, I just didn't want to, no, I just didn't want to deal with it.

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Because, you know, after today's experience, I will.

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because now I know at least, you know, I'm starting to understand a little bit more what's going on.

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Once again, went through passport control.

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Now, this is actually not the TSA.

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This is the, um,

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Customs and border protection agency, I guess it is.

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
CBP.

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And, um, yeah, a lot of typing on the terminal there.

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And, uh, how long have you been in the UK?

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, actually, I live there.

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Uh, I was just, uh, just here a couple weeks ago.

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I got a company here and I go back and forth.

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Ah, what are you doing the UK?

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I just live there.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Uh-huh.

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I got a big M on my Customs form.

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I said, what's that for?

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Many.

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So, what do you mean many?

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't know.

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So, there wouldn't tell me.

174
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I get my bag.

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And, uh, of course, you know, I handed it to the CBP officer.

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And, I knew that I was, actually, it's interesting.

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He puts it in a, I've seen this, this happened last time.

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It was, well, he put it in there like a blue, um, a plastic envelope.

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
My Customs form.

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So, it's clear on one side and blue on the other and it's plastic and just kind of like a

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Sheath and he puts it in there.

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And, they have yellow ones, too.

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But, I get a blue one.

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm blue.

185
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And, uh, I had a nice chat with Officer Williams who, uh, was very confused.

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Um, but kind of the same procedure's last time.

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you have a business card?

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Do you have any other proof of ID?

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You know, I showed him my pilot slice since this time.

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Like here.

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How about this?

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And, uh, didn't want to see my bags.

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And then he went to go talk to a supervisor and he came back and he took his time.

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You know, and, uh, do you have any cash with you?

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So, yeah, sure.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Here.

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Take a look.

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No, no, I mean, do you have more than $10,000?

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No.

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Although, if, uh, if the dollar keeps dropping like that,

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I probably will have to just for, for tips along the way.

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And, uh, so this took about 45 minutes to an hour as usual.

203
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And I said, you know, Officer Williams, could you please tell me what's going on?

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He says, oh, this is just random.

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What do you mean, random?

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Three times in a row.

207
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Chicago, twice in San Francisco.

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The last three trips I've made to the US.

209
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah.

210
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah.

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And, you know, he's just random.

212
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Three times in a row.

213
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's random.

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yep.

215
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're just, uh, one of the ones on the list.

216
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What list?

217
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh, I don't know.

218
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Uh, this is information that we don't control.

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Well, who puts it in there?

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No.

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And then I say, uh, but it says right here, um, that the seat on this little sign, you know,

222
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
it says where you'll treat me with curdy.

223
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You'll treat me curduously, what you have.

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It says you'll explain the CBP procedure.

225
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh, yes.

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm explaining it to you.

227
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I just did.

228
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He said.

229
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Which is just routine.

230
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And it's just random.

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I call bullshit on that.

232
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So anyway, we know it's not the TSA.

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm on some other list.

234
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And there's something in the terminal.

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Something flopping around that is very confusing.

236
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And I'm not like in it.

237
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So next time I'll record it.

238
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Well, four, four, two, seven, six, eight, well, three, seven, three, did it.

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Bloody hell.

240
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If you change that number, I'm going to have to forget it.

241
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Um, let alone the jingle.

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's annoying.

243
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Anyway, um, what I want to say here.

244
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Alan, put in the bottle.

245
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Um, where all bricks or all piping faces in shame have been kicked out of your own

246
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
two days late.

247
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Um, ironically, Swiss police really happy.

248
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So then I have to deal with lots of things with you.

249
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We're getting this year.

250
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah.

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah.

252
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

253
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah.

254
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

255
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah.

256
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I noticed that.

257
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I actually talked about it.

258
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I know agenda.

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The show I do with John C.

260
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Tovorek, uh, which went up Saturday.

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And people are so depressed in the UK.

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This is really.

263
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's not good.

264
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You know, we were surprisingly good in the rugby finals.

265
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Didn't win.

266
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Came in second.

267
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Which, of course, is the first loser.

268
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It depends on how you look at it.

269
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But not even qualifying for the full, uh, Euro 2008.

270
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's, that's really sad.

271
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And of course, it's the manager's fault.

272
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's why he got sacked immediately.

273
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
David, right the day after.

274
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But wow.

275
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
People, you see grown men walking around just a little bit hunched over.

276
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Just a little bit depressed about not being in the competition.

277
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But you're right.

278
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I bet they're really happy.

279
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They're the who looking to be showing up at the finals.

280
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But the final.

281
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Nothing like I want to San Francisco with a message from my friend, the prolific programmer.

282
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Hi, I'm prolific programmer here from Miami Florida for the week.

283
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I just wanted to, I was just thinking here episode 69 when we're guiding you in day to day,

284
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,200
with seems like a very nice device. To synchronize with your 800 you'll need to use our

285
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:39,680
sync with including both. I believe the all command line options are dash ABZ and just back up the

286
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:48,320
whatever the SD card is called to the to the MN to the Emini and micro SD card over the internet.

287
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:55,440
It takes two IP addresses and you should be done. I will post instruction for the instruction.

288
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,320
I blog at log.prolificprogrammer.com. Many thanks kids.

289
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,160
Yo, prolific programmer. Thank you. Yeah, I hadn't even thought about that. Of course, these are

290
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,640
unique devices. Linux. So you can easily use all those kinds of commands. Like I don't

291
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,280
know if it has our sync actually. I'll have to check. I'm sure it does. That's such a basic

292
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,720
command. I'd forgotten all about that. Sometimes, you know, there's just so many beautiful,

293
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,200
beautiful little things you can do with the command line, which is really what I like about my

294
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,080
Mac as well. I always have a command line window open. It was just to look at, you know, do a top

295
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:37,120
minus you to see what the processor doing processes. I can ping something to see my network connection

296
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,160
is alive. Oh, and the the 810 by the way comes with the terminal window built in. And of course,

297
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,440
now the actually have a keyboard attached to this thing, unlike the N800. You can actually kind of,

298
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:57,200
you know, do like unique stuff. Command line. It's it's freaky. The more modern we get, the more I

299
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:05,120
I earn for G-Max. Hello. Hi, Adam. It's John Clark. You know, John? Yes. Not here.

300
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,000
Somebody's from the funny direction. I used to have a pair of Nokia tyres. I'm a van that I ran many

301
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,520
years ago. Let's see. I told you it was a cookie company. They used to make rubber boots and tires

302
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,280
apparently. Why I heard them as a cell phone company? I'm glad you got the 810. Didn't think it would

303
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,520
take you long. And I'm just curious because I've been looking at the 800. Okay. And they've moved

304
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,800
the 5 way navigator off the front panel on for the keyboard level, which means you can't use the

305
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,000
5 way navigator without sliding the keyboard out. I just wonder whether you think that's a good idea

306
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,360
or not. Because it did occur to me that if you were using the keyboard, you might use it closed up.

307
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,720
If the navigator was on the front panel where I used to be, just curious by the way. Oh, and

308
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,000
fuck you. Hey, that's our Britain Basel. Yeah, you know, I'm sorry, not a Britain Basel. Who was

309
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,800
that? That wasn't my Britain Basel. That was who? I Adam is John Clark. John, that's what I meant.

310
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,800
Yeah, John, you know, interestingly enough, that is the first thing I noticed.

311
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,880
Even when I was looking at the pictures of the N800 and 10. And by the way, there's a link that

312
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,640
you can buy one. It's not the super duper price yet, but it's through Amazon and they're pretty

313
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,680
reliable. In fact, I've never had a problem with Amazon. So if you want to get one, you'll probably

314
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,640
wind up, you know, just like the iPhone, you know, and you'll wind up paying more. More than I

315
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:32,240
can offer to you in the future, at least. Yeah, the 5 way navigator. That's the

316
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:40,560
up-down left right. And then it's kind of like a, like a poor man's mouse button. I have to admit,

317
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,520
I really like using that. I like it more than using the touch screen because, you know, don't forget

318
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:51,280
that it has a complete touch screen system. So you can put your finger on the screen and you can

319
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,720
basically move the page around up-down left right. You can click on stuff. So I kind of switch

320
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,440
back and forth. It depends on what kind of page I'm on. For instance, the Google News page,

321
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:12,560
news.google.com. There I'll use the the 5 way navigator versus maybe if I'm going to check

322
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,320
some comments at curie.com. In that case, I'll just use the touch screen email. I don't use the

323
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,440
navigator at all because it does Gmail. So beautifully, I use the Gmail shortcuts. But really,

324
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:32,000
sliding the keyboard open is actually a little more comfortable for me. It's easier to hold the

325
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,520
device because it's not just one flat thing. You know, when you slide it open, then you have something

326
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,760
to hold on to and your thumbs really can rest comfortably on it. So I kind of enjoy it using it

327
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:50,960
with the keyboard open. Man, the battery life is just unbelievable. I think I listened to five

328
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:59,520
different shows on the way over. It was still only, you know, like it still had six days stand by

329
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:06,000
two hours full use. Now, I did have it in an offline mode. Also, I forgot to tell you Friday,

330
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:15,360
it has a GPS built in. It has whatever the map is that the N800 also had the same program,

331
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,240
which is not my favorite. I really like the maybe it is a way finder. But it's not the same,

332
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,200
it's the one I have on the E61I, which I really like. Maybe that one is the one that's becoming

333
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,920
available in I think December. Along with Skype, I did the whole upgrade. There was a new version

334
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,240
of the software that came out. So I flashed my device, did the backup restore all of that work

335
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,600
almost flawlessly. I think the only thing I had to reset was my phone, my Bluetooth connection

336
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:56,000
to my phone, so I can use the 3G data connection. But yeah. I don't know what I'm saying anymore.

337
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,720
Please, someone save me. Save me. Hold on. I'm playing another comment here.

338
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:21,440
Well, you have to understand something that as far as mask media concerns, this is not like a pin

339
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,640
up for the internet, I think that, but pre-press doesn't make that. Yeah, I know where this is going.

340
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,200
And of course you're right. Of course. And I'm seeing it too, man. I'm seeing that Ron Paul is just,

341
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,440
you know, he's barely taken seriously. And you can sit there and say, why is that? But it's pretty

342
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,080
clear. You know, this is a race between Hillary and Obama and then maybe Giuliani or someone on

343
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,480
the on the Republican side. And we'll see if it is just us cooks out here who are who raised five

344
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,120
million dollars. You know, if it is just, you know, a handful of people, then it really won't work.

345
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:06,080
Will it? Of course, when I'm hoping, is that we're millions strong, millions, millions who have

346
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,240
heard the message. And we'll vote for Ron Paul. There are corporations and corporations are going to

347
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,640
do what is in the best interest of corporations. I don't necessarily fault them for that,

348
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,360
but the reality is they're not going to push around all because they don't want to support Ron Paul.

349
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,680
They don't think that's where the money is. To get a clue on this, all you have to do is go to

350
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:31,120
YouTube, listen to some of the interviews they have with Ron Paul. Yeah, I agree. Very condescending.

351
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,440
The other thing I don't agree with there was what you're saying is that that's not where the money is

352
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,960
clearly. It is where some money is because, you know, we raise almost like four and a half million

353
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,000
bucks in one day. Hey, does anyone else December 16th is happening? Is the Boston Tea Party the next

354
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,800
the money bomb? We're going to drop on Ron Paul. Let me know, will you please?

355
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,200
You'll hear, you know, he's trying to say, hey, I like their audience. You know, they're doing so good in the

356
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,480
text polls. And they try to struggle off like that. That the poll was nothing. Like it's interesting

357
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,400
to get it's not valid. Yeah, so we get the support like their lives. They're looking, you know,

358
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,800
taking it from people. And while when you look at how they try to belittle him, trying to make

359
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,520
his efforts in his accomplishments as small as possible, you'll understand that this is a

360
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,960
corporate minute about a freshman over. Yeah, I agree. And that was kind of cool that it was the

361
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,080
Fox News poll I think. And Ron Paul was at the top of the poll. Ron Paul was at the top of the poll.

362
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,640
And he said, he said, hey, you got a really smart audience. Those Yahoo's over there. I was pretty funny.

363
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:36,240
And they tried to downplay it. So maybe that maybe, you know, I'm sure there's only so many people

364
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:44,720
watching, uh, was that Fox News Fox, yeah, the Fox News channel. I mean, they don't have millions of

365
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,160
people watching. I don't think. But maybe it's a representative sample. The internet, however, is the

366
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,360
ultimate form of free press because all of the things free. Because anybody can post anything. And

367
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,680
I have, and you have, and everybody else has equal footing as a major corporation. They can't buy a

368
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:07,520
stage and lock me out of it. We all have an equal opportunity access to that stage. So that's why

369
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,720
you're seeing a fake difference online. Well, we got a whole piece we can transfer that action that

370
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,360
energy from online to the real world. And two happens. Fuck you out. I'm going to fucking media.

371
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,560
Yeah, right on. Hey, if you want to get a great deal on a domain name,

372
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,920
I have a page at curie.com. You can find it in the show. No, it's a daily source code.com as well.

373
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,120
Where you can use one of my three codes. They used each code for a different reason for a different

374
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,400
type of discount. It's real simple. Easy to remember. DSC one, DSC two, a DSC three. And I think DSC

375
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,520
one is if you just want to get a domain name for six. Wait, did DSC three is domain name for 60,

376
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,360
65. Can't get a cheaper anywhere else. And also, I believe, um, I'm not supposed to,

377
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,880
isn't it Sony headphones? I think are sponsoring the network. They've got this new line of

378
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,360
headphones out. And I asked, uh, you know, really, what I really want is I want everyone who's doing

379
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,640
the campaign to have a pair, uh, but Sony wouldn't spring for them or the agency wouldn't spring for them.

380
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,640
Understandably so because, you know, that could get pretty costly. If you look at how many

381
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:21,360
shows are running the commercials. Um, but apparently they got some really, really good ones now.

382
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,240
Go to Sony.com slash headphones. Uh, I think they're great for, uh, probably, uh, really good,

383
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,120
knowing Sony because I use Sony headphones, professional headphones. I've used them almost all my life.

384
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:42,240
I think I started out with pioneers in the very beginning, uh, but quickly moved to, uh, move to Sony.

385
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,960
And I've tried all kinds of headphones. Sony really knows what they're doing when it comes to sound.

386
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,800
So, um, I'll see if I can get it at my hands on a pair and I'll let you know how they are.

387
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,840
Interested in the wireless ones. The, uh, yeah, they have wireless, right? I think it's Bluetooth.

388
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,640
Now I'll check those out. Maybe I should be able to hook them up to the N8010. Oh boy.

389
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:12,080
Okay, one more song, um, from the pod safe music. Holy crap. It's not my favorite performance

390
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,920
but whenever comment Tyler comes out with a new song on the pod save music network, I just got to play.

391
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:51,920
I think about my kiss you, oh my world is around. Now we're all getting hands in hand.

392
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:59,840
It was crazy world, uh, I'm so into you and don't you? Maybe you're driving wild.

393
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:11,120
Well, I love you so, and I just got to let you know to find me, oh, down in my soul.

394
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,880
Oh, we're looking at everything, please. I like that funny way you smile.

395
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,360
Oh, now let's go to you, baby, you're just my style.

396
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

397
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:18,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

398
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I love you everything but here

399
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I like that money away you smile

400
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Oh darling, don't you know

401
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I don't just say more or less

402
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I love you everything but here

403
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I like that money away you smile

404
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Oh now they're talking to me

405
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Baby, you're just lying

406
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Carmen Tyler, you are just my smile

407
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
On the pontiff music network

408
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
A live I presume

409
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah, sounds like

410
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Now I've been watching dancing with the stars so much

411
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That I would have to easily be able to identify that as a jive

412
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Ladies and gentlemen

413
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Next time we'll do the American sway

414
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
All right, I'm pretty useless

415
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
A 24 25 minutes

416
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Almost like the old days

417
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'll leave it at that

418
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And I'll be back tomorrow

419
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
We'll do a full week

420
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm pretty sure of it

421
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Looking forward to it

422
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
