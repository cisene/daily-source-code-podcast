00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Adam, Adam, Adam. You have DSCs, CSPs, pictures of naked pod show honeys. We follow the

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
monies, conspiracy, controversy, nylon, classic songs, blue pills, red pills, mashups,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,840
fuckups. My head is starting to spin. The little guy is shafted again. Maybe I'll take a

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:34,000
tile and I'll pee him. Oh man, these things are blue. Adam, curry. Fuck you. Yo. I'll

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,640
just share it fairly. $6.71 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass. Done the next

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,080
generation radio content in my ears. I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:09,320
We listen to the Daily Shorescoe, who are cooler and moodier than any other podcast on the

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,320
internet. And when I think moodier, I think Adam Curry.

9
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Yo's no problem. Yo's no problem. With all you stupid friends, they chat every

10
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:33,280
game. They'll follow every inch and no problem. Yo's no problem. Yo's no problem. The way we're

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,280
going. Yo's no problem. Yo's no problem. Yo's no problem. Yo's no problem. Yo's no problem.

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:21,600
Yo's no problem. Yo's no problem. Yo's no problem. Yo's no problem. Yo's no problem. Yo's no problem.ья's

You're so fabulous

18
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm so happy

19
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Daddy's favorite truth

20
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Favorite truth

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Ready cards and brand new colors

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,600
This is my thank you for all you've been

23
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm so happy now

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,600
I wasn't party planned

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,600
You always get just what you want

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,600
So what's the things that my own hands

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,600

And I know you'll feel good

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,600
I'm a little bit older than you

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Now you want me to tell you

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,600

And I know you'll feel good

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

54
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,400
That's the way to get a school life ride.

55
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,600
Arolan, Chris, I took your boyfriend from the Podsake Music Network.

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,800
Find that in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

57
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Hey, everybody.

58
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,600
How you doing?

59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Good to be back.

60
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
It's always nice to do at least one Friday show.

61
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
I'm not even going to apologize.

62
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
You know what I'm doing?

63
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
You know, I've been really busy.

64
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,600
I did calculate some of the hours.

65
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
It takes me about an hour and a half to get from the curry manner where I'm situated

66
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,600
momentarily for the footballer Friday festivities to the crash pad and shortage in London,

67
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,600
about an hour and a half and about an hour and a half closer to two hours to get back home

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
at the end of the day, which is usually I don't usually have I haven't been getting home before

69
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
like eight at least and closer to eight thirty nine o'clock.

70
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Those are exactly the three hours I need to make my show on a daily basis.

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
It's just what it takes.

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
He got to understand today I was staying home.

73
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
This is going to be a production day.

74
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,600
It's a couple of administrative things I got to do.

75
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,600
The pile of admin, which is basically crap that comes into our mailbox here at home,

76
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,600
is about the tip over, which means it's time to take a look at it again.

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,600
To do some of that stuff today and I started prepping at 11 a.m.

78
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Patricia and I slept in just a little bit to like eight thirty nine o'clock.

79
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
It is now two thirty seven.

80
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
That's how long it has taken me because it is first of all,

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
there's some amazing stuff that's going on.

82
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I've been getting a huge lobby group calling into the voice mail number.

83
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,600
So I got to talk to you about that because I'm very excited about some of the messages I'm hearing.

84
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
So that's coming up later on today's show.

85
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,600
There were just tons of other voice mail related stuff.

86
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
You know, I try to keep the food bar Friday is kind of moving and grooving,

87
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
but I can't help myself today.

88
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
I got to play some of this stuff for you.

89
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
It's crazy.

90
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,600
So for here's something that's nuts that's going on in the Netherlands right now.

91
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,600
You know, I grew up there basically after being born in the states move there when I was seven.

92
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,600
And in the early eighties, I worked at a broadcast company,

93
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:42,600
which is I don't want the stories too long and complicated to explain exactly how they went from a pirate radio station

94
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,600
situated in the North Sea in the days of Caroline, me and me go radio and North Sea.

95
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,600
They were radio Veronica and they went legit and we're using the public airwaves in the early 80s,

96
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,600
television and radio and I got a gig there doing television and radio as well.

97
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
So this was a very dynamic organization.

98
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Very young.

99
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
I was 19 when I joined them when I was on television and it was fun.

100
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
It was just a crazy ass time.

101
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
We were in broadcasting.

102
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,600
You know, our legacy was pirate radio ships.

103
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
You know, you can imagine what kind of a company this was.

104
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
It was great to work at.

105
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
It was just, it was a lot of fun.

106
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,600
It was truly, it determined a lot of the blueprint of Adam Curry trust me.

107
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,600
So a book came out earlier this week.

108
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
I don't know the title of the book.

109
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
And I haven't read it either.

110
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,600
But this book was put together by a guy who actually I've known for a couple of years.

111
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,600
He produced a radio show with me.

112
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
I don't know.

113
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Maybe eight or nine.

114
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Is it that long ago?

115
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Yeah.

116
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
No.

117
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Seven.

118
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Five or six years ago.

119
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
I don't know.

120
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
I was doing like a Friday night show.

121
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,600
This was, this was kind of just before I started with a daily source code.

122
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Anyway.

123
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:05,600
So this guy wrote a book about those crazy years of Veronica and who was sleeping with who?

124
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
And there's some nutty ass stories.

125
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,600
And it's all funny, you know, because first of all, we were all crazy at the time.

126
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
We were all, we were just all nuts.

127
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,600
And the whole book is basically filled with all the sex capaids of a radio Veronica.

128
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
At least that's what, and television Veronica.

129
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
That's what I'm led to believe.

130
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
So anyway, let me get to the story.

131
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
So this book comes out.

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
And the guy is now out there promoting the book.

133
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
And he interviewed me.

134
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
And I was happy to tell him all kinds of stories.

135
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Because it's funny, you know, and it's funny to look back at 25 years of

136
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Sodom, Gamora, and DeBotchery.

137
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:46,600
And I told him a story about time when I was going out with one of the assistants, like a

138
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Productions, production assistant.

139
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I think she was also 19 at the time.

140
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
And we were kind of dating, you know, for a couple of months.

141
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,600
And at the time, the brand new codec disk camera had come out.

142
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
If you'll recall that.

143
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,600
And you know, I was always in the gadgets and you kind of got to understand that today

144
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
It's real simple to think of a camera as no big deal.

145
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,600
But the codec disk camera, which was a huge flop, by the way.

146
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Technologically crap.

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
It was really small.

148
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
You could slip it into into your pocket.

149
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
You could, you know, it was a really easy format to handle.

150
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
You still had to have a develop to this film.

151
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
But it was something new.

152
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
So I got into one of those.

153
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I think for Christmas or something.

154
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
What did you do when you're 19?

155
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
You're fooling around and say, how long I'm going to take a picture of you?

156
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Let me take another one.

157
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Yeah, well, she's naked.

158
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
You know, nothing really outrageous.

159
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
But, you know, it's naked pictures.

160
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
You know, me.

161
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
I always talk about naked pictures.

162
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
And as I take a couple snaps, think nothing of it.

163
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I've got the camera.

164
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,600
And a week or so later, maybe a little bit longer than that.

165
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I find myself interviewing the Rolling Stones in London.

166
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
This was the time the Harlem shuffle came out.

167
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
If you get what the name of the record was.

168
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,600
And remember the Harlem shuffle had to kind of like that cartoon music video.

169
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,600
The guy who did later went on to do Red and Stimpy actually animated that video.

170
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
So this is a big press junk.

171
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
And the world press was all, you know, we each had our room and our camera crew set up.

172
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
And we'd wait for the stones to come by to interview them.

173
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
And so of course, you know, this is hours of waiting.

174
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Finally, there's a, you know, like a,

175
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Hey, knock at the door.

176
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Ron Wood and Keith Richards comes stumbling in completely hammered off their ass.

177
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,600
They, you know, like, we got to go Lou and it's the rolling to the bathroom.

178
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,600
They got a big bowie knife scooping coke out of a bag and snorting it straight off the knife.

179
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
So I'm like, wow, this is awesome.

180
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
You know, this is fantastic.

181
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
So I interviewed the guys.

182
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,600
We have a crazy ass interview, you know, sitting on the ground.

183
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
I think we threw pillows on the ground to make some kind of different set.

184
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Then your traditional, let's sit on some chairs and let's do over the shoulder interviews.

185
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
And so we're done.

186
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
And the guy who went along constant mayors who was producing, he said,

187
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Oh, dude, we got to get a picture of you and Ron Wood and Keith Richards.

188
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,600
For the newspaper, and since it was public broadcasting back in the day,

189
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,600
you had, you basically would, it's kind of the BBC in a way.

190
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
You know, if you had something that you wanted to publicize,

191
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,600
you take it to the, to the NOS, which is kind of like the,

192
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
the overarching organization.

193
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,600
They had their own press relations office.

194
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,600
And you know, you basically hand off your film to them and they'll write the press release,

195
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
etc.

196
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
So, but we know how to camera.

197
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
We're like, does anyone know when brought a steel camera?

198
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
And I said, wait a minute, I've got this, I've got this code act disk thing.

199
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
And so, no, we take a couple shots, right?

200
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
And it's cool.

201
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,600
And Woody and Keith, they, they, they're out.

202
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
And, you know, I think we obviously stayed overnight,

203
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
no, until I went back the next day.

204
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
And, you know, so I said, oh, here's the, the disk.

205
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
You can send that off to the, to the PR department at the NOS.

206
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,600
And they can get the pictures off of it and get it in the paper.

207
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,600
And then later that afternoon, I realized that this is the same disk

208
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
that has my girlfriend on it naked.

209
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Like, oh man, this is so good.

210
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
So, it had already gone over there.

211
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,600
So, I literally, and at the time the PR department was located in the editing facilities

212
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
or in the same building.

213
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
So, I could get in there.

214
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
And I was able to get in, find the envelope, retrieve it.

215
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
And I took it to like a, you know, a one hour Photoshop thing.

216
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
And, and got the pictures for the PR department.

217
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,600
And, of course, kept the ones that were personal intended for me only.

218
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
So, that's, you know, that was pretty funny story.

219
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
It's even funnier when you think that this girl,

220
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Caroline, went on to become an extremely famous television presenter in the Netherlands.

221
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
I mean, like, big time.

222
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,600
She's, you know, she, all those big shows, like, you know,

223
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
the equivalent of like dealer, no deal.

224
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
You know, all of these huge shows, she's a, she hosts that.

225
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
She's as she makes millions a year.

226
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
She's a really big deal.

227
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
And so, the story comes out.

228
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,600
And, and people are freaking out about it.

229
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Like, Adam Curry has naked pictures of Caroline Tenson.

230
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,600
And, like, yeah, so, you know, the story was, it was funny that, you know,

231
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,600
this almost got out even before she was famous,

232
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,600
but, you know, that I had to break in and retrieve the pictures.

233
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,600
And now there's like this whole thing going on and people are saying,

234
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
well, well, what will he do with him?

235
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
You know, are they locked up in your safe?

236
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Oh, dude, they're in some cardboard box for the rest of my naked pictures.

237
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
I don't know where they are.

238
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I definitely have them.

239
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,600
So, so the Dutch press is going.

240
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Not so for something that took place 25 years later.

241
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Oh, I got to love it.

242
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Okay, let me see, here we go.

243
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
We're going to be talking about a number of things today.

244
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Email from, who's this from?

245
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Guy Clark.

246
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
First time you made a long time listener, Adam,

247
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
who's on the uselessness of the podcast awards was spot-on.

248
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
This is my first year at The New Media.

249
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I knew new, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New and Boy,

250
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
and the sense of community was overwhelming.

251
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Regardless of the size of ones, audience, everyone was helpful.

252
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Full of insights.

253
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Ready to share stories are atleast a free cocktail.

254
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Oh, lots of those indeed.

255
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,600
The whole point of this new, MOUDEO Revolution is to create compelling content

256
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
for whatever your interest is.

257
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Although there were a way too many dudes.

258
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Fuck the awards.

259
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,520
We need more women in podcasting. Cheers from the Midwest says guy ps that Von Jovi mashup blew my mind

260
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,720
Well, dude. I've got a whole new one for you. You're gonna dig this

261
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,400
It's from mashuptown.com, of course. The Mockingbird Trayer from Iki

262
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,000
You're just found right and he's down on his back you're still

263
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
You know what's the matter about day?

264
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,600
What you're following?

265
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
She brings all my face for no

266
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
You're not for no

267
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
She's gonna hold on

268
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,600
You're why we fight? It doesn't make it that much of a make it all the time

269
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,600
We're trying to chill up and that's what I'm holding on

270
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
We'll give it a shot

271
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
We'll give it a shot

272
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
We'll give it a shot

273
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
We'll give it a shot

274
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,600
We'll give it a shot

275
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
We'll give it a shot

276
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Iki's Mockingbird Prayer

277
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Mixing up M&M's Mockingbird

278
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
We're living on a prayer

279
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
A little bit of other Banjovi tracks in there

280
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,600
For mashuptown.com, catch that in the show notes at dailysourceport.com

281
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
It is the football friday episode number

282
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,600
671 things heating up in the old country

283
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Hold on a second

284
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
I had so many problems with cast blaster

285
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,600
The morning was telling me that it couldn't find

286
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Temp.mp3 and I had to go and configure my dot i and i file

287
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
And there's anything I hate

288
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
It's configuring my dot i and i files

289
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
You know what I'm saying?

290
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
I don't know

291
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
This is you

292
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Still got from Germany on my way to Berlin

293
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
And I'm driving here

294
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Pass the football stuff exit

295
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
And I was wondering

296
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,600
When do you plan on opening the office in football stuff

297
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
First question

298
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Second question

299
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Are you gonna do a launch party in Germany

300
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
And if so

301
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Can we all be invited

302
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Bye bye

303
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
You sales guy

304
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
So two things first of all

305
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
We intend to be open by the first quarter

306
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
So January 1st

307
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Hopefully if all things go according to plan

308
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,600
It doesn't need to seem that Putzdom is the place that we're going to be

309
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
In fact

310
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
There's a couple of people complaining about those

311
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Those subsidies

312
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Let me see

313
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Who is it?

314
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Starmont Rae

315
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Says I was listening to DSC67

316
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
He just got the part we talk about the German policy of subsidizing

317
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
50% of an employee salary

318
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
That's only in Putzdom by the way

319
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
It's very specific to that area

320
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,600
The only place this money could be coming from would be the employees or employers

321
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
To taxes that presume

322
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
So it sounds good at first glance

323
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,600
But there's no way a system like that could be both beneficial and sustainable

324
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Well

325
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Yeah, okay

326
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
There's a lot to be said about that

327
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
But this is the way the system is right now

328
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
I look

329
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Later on in this program

330
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I'm gonna try and fix America first

331
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
And then we can always go and see if we can fix Germany

332
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Okay

333
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
He does end up with a fuck you Adam Curry

334
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Thank you very much

335
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
It's nice

336
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
How many people have called in

337
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Have taken comic strip bloggers lead

338
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Just to end with a good old fashioned fuck you Adam Curry

339
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Nice

340
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600

00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I showgirls that is

352
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Thanks for flying out from Chicago

00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Just a final assignment on here

361
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Can't go

362
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Yeah

363
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
It was awesome to meet up with you

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
And

365
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600

And the whole crew

367
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
A pod show

368
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
And thank you Adam

369
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
It was really great

370
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Looking out into the crowd

371
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,600
And seeing your face when we got that award

372
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
And all of Pod Show there

373
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
It was really great hanging out with them

374
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
And we had that

375
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
So thank you very much for coming

376
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Love you guys

377
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Thank you

378
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Thank you girls so much

379
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
You don't have to thank me

380
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Thank you

381
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Thank you for doing what you do

382
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Being who you are

383
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
And thank you for just even the hint at one day

384
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
I'll get some naked pictures

385
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
So you too in 25 years

386
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Gonna be the subject of

387
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Controversy and intrigue

388
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Oh man something cool happened at the office

389
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
I have to change the names

390
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
To protect the innocent

391
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
When we had the digital music awards

392
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Was that only last week

393
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
I guess it was last week

394
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Well we had a pretty big crew there

395
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
I think in total we had 25 people

396
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
You know between camera

397
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
And editing

398
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
And production logistics

399
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
We had a bar

400
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
A lot of things going on

401
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
A lot of moving parts

402
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
And we had I think two or three

403
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Makeup people

404
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
And one is this beautiful

405
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Latina girl Maya

406
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
And you know we had a couple of the folks

407
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
From the US over from the poncho hq in San Francisco

408
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Over as well

409
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,600
And you know so the way that kind of works

410
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Is you know they had specific tasks

411
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,600
But we have room in

412
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Because it's kind of like a live work

413
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Type of place the crash pad and shortage

414
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Oh there goes someone flying low today

415
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
You hear that shitty weather

416
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,600
So he's got to be probably about a thousand feet

417
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Anyway

418
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
So this office you know we have a huge like living room

419
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Open kitchen area

420
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Which is you know it's yes we have about eight desks in there

421
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
And a sitting area

422
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
But it's also used as studio

423
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Very often it's a natural habitat for a studio

424
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
I have to say

425
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Then we have two bedrooms

426
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
One bedroom has a bathroom

427
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
That is the audio recording room

428
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,600
But it also has one of those couches that folds out into a bed

429
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
And then we have the video editing suite

430
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Where we have two editing stations

431
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
And again a couch there

432
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Would that you know can fold out into a kind of like

433
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,600
We call those the divon or whatever

434
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Crap you know what I mean

435
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,600
One of those couches that just folds flat into a bed

436
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,600
So one of the pod show San Francisco employees

437
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,600
Cooked up with this beautiful Maya

438
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,600
And we knew he was going out on a date with her

439
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
But then I heard yesterday in the office

440
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
The most hilarious story

441
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
So apparently so he was sleeping in the back room

442
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,600
All the way in the back with the bathroom

443
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,600
But I happen to know that that couch which turns into a bed

444
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
It's kind of rickety on its legs

445
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
And it's fine to lay on it

446
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,600
But let's say you want to have a proper shag on it

447
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,600
No way because I think the legs would probably break off

448
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,600
So he took this girl into the

449
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Into the video editing suite

450
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
And you know did the nasty

451
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,600
But then when he went to open the door

452
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
He turned the handle and pulled it

453
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
And then the handle on the other side of the door

454
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Fell off

455
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
And it was the part that actually has the

456
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
The shaft that goes into the door

457
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
You can't open it

458
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,600
It's just like a

459
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
It's like a little square hole

460
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
That you literally have to stick a square peg into in order to turn it

461
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
And it's a serious door

462
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
It's not like a flimsy thing

463
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
So they were both locked in

464
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
But naked

465
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
And they were there for half an hour

466
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
And they couldn't get out until finally he figured

467
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Oh wait a minute and he used some scissors

468
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
But he told me yesterday that they literally

469
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,600
were considering they were about to start sending

470
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
How emails the people

471
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Staying help

472
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
One girl in casting

473
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
With Adam Curry

474
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Adam, who are you ready to be stumps

475
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600

Bring it on

478
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
I'm feeling good today

00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Come on, John

480
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600

00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Oh good

485
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
I went by the way

486
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Yeah

487
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
As you get here

488
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
I have the flu

489
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Try to get high

533
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Hey

534
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Hellereaar, good start!

535
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,600
The nonstop, dance.

536
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Dance, dance, dance.

537
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Dance, yeah!

538
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Once the number one, the Gibson Brothers.

539
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
The nonstop dance.

540
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
So this is Answer Number Two.

541
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,600
From 1978, baby.

542
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
This is exile, just you all over.

543
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm gonna go with me, gonna light your smile

544
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,600
I hold them and thinkin' about your pain

545
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
You won't wanna do that

546
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
I know it was massive

547
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,600
I wanna kiss you all alone

548
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
I'm over in here

549
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
I wanna kiss you all alone

550
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,600
To the night close in me

551
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
I answer number two, exile and kiss you all alone

552
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
And this is answering number three

553
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
From 1979

554
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
The real thing

555
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Don't you feel the fall

556
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Okay, can you feel the fall

557
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
All right, you're stutting on that one young

558
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
Can you feel the fall

559
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Can you feel the fall

560
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Two out of three ain't bad

561
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Great music from the 70's

562
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
Like this one

563
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
And so number three to real thing

564
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
And can you feel the fall

565
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
And that concludes this

566
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,600
70's hit test and it's number 91

567
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Alrighty Adam, how did you do?

568
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Got two out of three

569
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
And I said nothing

570
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
So have them all

571
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
No, not quite

572
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
Did you at least like them all?

573
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Yeah

574
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Yes, I hope so

575
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Nice man, that was great music

576
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,600
From 977, 978 and 979

577
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600

Fuck you look to the daily

591
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
I don't want to go with Adam

592
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Hold on, hold on

00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Yon, what did you see?

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
So hold on a second

596
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600

No, I'm not

604
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Yes, I'm not

605
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Well, whatever

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
See ya

607
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Yo!

608
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Hey this is Scott from topdeadcenterpodcast.com

609
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
You're listening to the daily source code

610
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
With Adam Holy Shit

611
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Look at my hair

612
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Look at my luscious flowing golden hair

613
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Fucker

614
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Fuck you in the neck

615
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Fucker

616
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Fucker

617
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
Fucker

618
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Fucker

619
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Fucker

620
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,600
Fucker

621
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Fucker

622
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
I gotta tell you, you guys are just outstanding

623
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
I, I don't know what it is

624
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
But whenever someone ends a comment

625
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Were that just cracked me up

626
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,600
And I'm curious

627
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Steve again

628
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,280
state you've again, the MTV follow-up question.

629
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,840
So let's say that the plus ticks off the way

630
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,080
codes look at mic.

631
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,120
And do you have any desire?

632
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,800
Not time.

633
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,320
But just do you have any desire to maybe occasionally

634
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,920
do like a guest DJ segment or anything like that?

635
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,320
I'm not imagining that it's going to be like the MTV

636
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,840
these again.

637
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,040
But are you just an executive now in a podcast

638
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,920
or is that kind of thing attract you at all?

639
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,560
Just curious again.

640
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,280
And how is the end?

641
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,720
Fuck you, Adam Cody.

642
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,560
Oh, yes.

643
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,480
Fuck you and your red pill.

644
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,640
Yo.

645
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,840
A very good question.

646
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,240
I'm not a big fan of doing television or video in general.

647
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,600
I just really don't like it.

648
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,720
I've got a mild to ret.

649
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,280
I can't control my hair myself, my wife has to do it.

650
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,720
Isn't it?

651
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,040
This is not really for me.

652
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,240
But I can do it.

653
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,160
And I have to tell you, if the vibe is right,

654
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,800
you can wake me up in the middle of the night

655
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,760
to do a segment if it's fun.

656
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,880
But when it comes to doing something regular,

657
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,280
just being something that I do at a set time each day

658
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,680
or each week, that's just tough for me.

659
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,360
That's just my life just doesn't fit with that anymore.

660
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,760
Please witness La Delta Sierra Charli.

661
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,320
His tough enough just to get a couple shows out a week.

662
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,560
I told you it's going to be this way

663
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,840
until the end of the year.

664
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,440
Then I think I'll be able to cruise into back into normal mode.

665
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,280
And we'll have our weeks.

666
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,400
We'll definitely have our weeks for sure.

667
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,680
And just know that I love you all and I'm really trying.

668
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,840
And it is a full bar Friday.

669
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,040
And we have not had a real proper full bar Friday

670
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,240
for the past couple of weeks

671
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,120
because we haven't had this guy on the show.

672
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,560
Your Honor, I'd like to make a motion

673
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,240
to rock this mother out.

674
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,920
Your Honor, please don't bang that gavel.

675
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,520
You can try this cowbell out.

676
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,480
Let's all give a nod.

677
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,640
Do the hardest work and lawyer.

678
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,200
He's charging time and man, man.

679
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,560
He's charging time.

680
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,120
Neo.

681
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,040
How's it going Adam?

682
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
It's Jersey Time.

683
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,880
The official musicologist of The Cha Cha.

684
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,960
Dude, I don't call to come back.

685
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,640
I've been here for years.

686
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,160
Yo, yo, I know I've been away for a little bit,

687
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
but you know, I've been listening to the shows

688
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,560
and the music, I've been playing it.

689
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,160
It's all right.

690
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,080
But I got something today for your full bar Friday

691
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,360
that you're just absolutely going to flip out about.

692
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,040
The band is the wild bunch and you've played them before,

693
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,400
but they got a brand new track up on the podcast

694
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,480
of music network.

695
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,640
I like these guys a lot.

696
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,920
They always get me moving.

697
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,760
And you know what?

698
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,920
The song starts off great.

699
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,280
Because it just starts with one word.

700
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,320
It starts with, can I get it from me?

701
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,160
Give me a woo.

702
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,640
Woo.

703
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,600
I'll have a more Friday.

704
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:46,760
I'm going to get the real, I'm going to let you chill.

705
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
I'm going to let you chill.

706
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
I'm going to let you chill.

707
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
I'm going to let you chill.

708
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
I'm going to let you chill.

709
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
I'm going to let you chill.

710
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
I'm going to let you chill.

711
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
I'm going to let you chill.

712
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
I'm going to let you chill.

713
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
I'm going to let you chill.

714
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760

I'm going to let you chill.

986
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Let me see.

987
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
Oh, man.

988
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,760
There's so many comments about the TSA, which of course has been on my mind lately.

989
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,760
Hey Adam, this is Pavlan from Ireland.

990
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Long time no see.

991
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
You are really starting to piss me off.

992
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,760
I am playing at Paris when they're weak.

993
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,760
I know I get this fucking TSA, this TSA.

994
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,760
I'm expecting a fuck of a cavity chair for I leave this bed.

995
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,760
So, thanks.

996
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
Holder.

997
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
The cavity surgeon did my friend.

998
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
Well, that's next.

999
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
I'm telling you.

1000
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
We're not far from it.

1001
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Captain Chris.

1002
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Of course from playedmadness.com.

1003
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,760
He heard me saying that I was just going to start smuggling illegal shit on the plane.

1004
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
It's just a prove I could do because I know I can do it.

1005
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,760
And he says, don't smuggling illegal shit on the airplane.

1006
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,760
It'll just come back to bite you and they will win regardless.

1007
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,760
Six month flight ban, et cetera, et cetera.

1008
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,760
In the meantime, he says, watch this clip.

1009
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,760
It'll make you feel better.

1010
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:40,760
And he sent me a link to a clip from Saturday Night Live, which is a very famous live comedy

1011
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
television program in the United States.

1012
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
I'm sure you've heard of it.

1013
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
It's on every Saturday.

1014
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
Yeah, it is.

1015
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Yeah, it is.

1016
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
I guess every single Saturday night, even if they do reruns around Saturday nights.

1017
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
I don't know.

1018
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
I was at 11 or something like that.

1019
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
11 30 they start.

1020
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
And they did an awesome skit.

1021
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,760
And it's only four minutes.

1022
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
But I think it works in audio.

1023
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
The setup is it's a classroom.

1024
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,760
There are two TSA security officials.

1025
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,760
And a room full of about, of course, it's all the Saturday Night Live cast members.

1026
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Six or seven sitting in school benches.

1027
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,760
TSA security agents, you know, the guys and gals who you meet.

1028
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Whenever you go flying at the security checkpoints.

1029
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,760
And I think these guys really nailed it.

1030
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
I think it's worth listening to.

1031
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,760
If you've already seen it, don't want to listen to it again.

1032
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Four minutes, 44 seconds.

1033
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
I hope you enjoy.

1034
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,760
Check this out on your football Friday.

1035
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,760
Welcome, everybody.

1036
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
Welcome.

1037
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
My partner and I here.

1038
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
We are from the Department of Homeland Security.

1039
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,760
And we want to start by saying that those of you gathered here today,

1040
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,760
America's last line in the defense against terrorism.

1041
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,760
The decisions you make affect the lives of millions every day.

1042
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,760
You are a vigilant precise and qualified.

1043
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Every one of you has at least a high school equivalent to your degree.

1044
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,760
And not one of you has ever been convicted of a felony.

1045
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,760
You are the cream of the crop.

1046
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
You are elite.

1047
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,760
You are America's heir, poor security.

1048
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
You are the TSA.

1049
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
You're yourselves a fan.

1050
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
You're yourselves a fan.

1051
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
So this week there was a loose thing.

1052
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,760
A recent airline restrictions concerning liquids and jails.

1053
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,760
And we would like to run through how that will affect policy.

1054
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
All right.

1055
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Let's start with a quick security refresher.

1056
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Name some liquids and some jails.

1057
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,760
To just yell out some liquids.

1058
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,760
Well, name some liquids and or some jails.

1059
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,760
They quits and jails.

1060
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,760
Anything you got?

1061
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Water.

1062
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
Water.

1063
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
That is a liquid.

1064
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Good.

1065
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
So bad.

1066
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
There you go.

1067
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,760
That is a jail.

1068
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Wow.

1069
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
You guys are doing great.

1070
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
Turkey sandwich.

1071
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,760
Nope.

1072
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
Nope.

1073
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
Not a liquid or a gel.

1074
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Right.

1075
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,760
But sometimes turkey is a little wet.

1076
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
Okay.

1077
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
That doesn't make it a liquid.

1078
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
What about mustard?

1079
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Go at that count.

1080
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,760
So a turkey sandwich is a liquid if it has mustard on it.

1081
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
No.

1082
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Because it wouldn't have more than three ounces of mustard on it.

1083
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
What if you love mustard?

1084
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,760
Turkey sandwich is never an liquid.

1085
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
Okay.

1086
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,760
So what if you put a turkey sandwich in a blender?

1087
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
Why would you do that?

1088
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,760
Well, if your job was wired shut.

1089
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Hey.

1090
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
Okay.

1091
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,760
The important thing about today is that the TSA

1092
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,760
is loosening our restrictions on liquids and jails.

1093
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Now, you can bring three ounces of liquids or jails

1094
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,760
as long as they are inside of a super baggy.

1095
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
Why?

1096
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Why?

1097
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,760
Why did it change?

1098
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
That's a good question.

1099
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
Good.

1100
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Because the FBI did test and found that three ounces of liquids

1101
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,760
can't blow up an airplane.

1102
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,760
But four ounces of liquid can't blow up an airplane.

1103
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,760
We're still not sure on that.

1104
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,760
But what is important here is that three ounces can't.

1105
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,760
So we're safe as long as we stick with the three.

1106
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,760
Well, what's to stop two people from each having three ounces?

1107
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,760
And then meeting on the plane to combine them.

1108
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,760
Chris, you want to take this one? No.

1109
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,760
Excuse me.

1110
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,760
I have a whole mess, security question.

1111
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
Right.

1112
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
Welcome America's chemical blasts.

1113
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,760
It's still woefully underprotected against attacks.

1114
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,760
Despite repeated warnings by experts that they are likely

1115
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,760
the next terrorist target.

1116
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
Airplane questions only.

1117
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,760
Okay.

1118
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,760
What if I am a passenger who does not have three ounces with me?

1119
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,760
But is confident I could produce three plus ounces on the flight?

1120
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
You mean producing a liquid?

1121
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Or a gel stop.

1122
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
No, no, no.

1123
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
Everybody, okay, here's the skinny.

1124
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
Here we go.

1125
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,760
We under the department of Homeland Security.

1126
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,760
And we have way more questions than answers.

1127
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
Okay.

1128
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
I don't know why.

1129
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,760
We publicize our policies to the terrorists so that they can get one step ahead of us.

1130
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
I don't know why.

1131
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
You have to take your shoes off.

1132
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,760
It's some airports and not others.

1133
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,760
But what I do know is that you can't say that we don't.

1134
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,760
I don't know what we're doing as long as there's FEMA.

1135
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
All right.

1136
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,760
Have a question.

1137
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
Great.

1138
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Yeah, I have been convicted of felonies.

1139
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,760
Much of time, so that can be a problem at all.

1140
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,760
So you can clearly tell these guys are, I got to tell you,

1141
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
a great job.

1142
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,760
They're going to get lots of shit when they go through airport security as a personal private

1143
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,760
citizens in the individuals.

1144
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,760
Just shows the absurdity of it all.

1145
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
And I'm going to move beyond all of this.

1146
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,760
Beyond the 9-11 conspiracies, beyond airport security.

1147
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,760
I was almost ready to say I'd move beyond the this thing called the Amaro,

1148
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,760
although I get a lot of hate mail people saying I'm full of shit.

1149
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,760
Apparently this topic came up on Larry King Live.

1150
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,760
Had a mic from Baker School of California.

1151
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,760
If somebody hasn't already pointed it out to you, you can go check out a clip of the

1152
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,760
Mexico President of the Sunday Fox on Larry King Live from a couple nights ago,

1153
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,760
where he basically talks about the I would guess probably the Amaro.

1154
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,760
Is what he's talking about unbelievable.

1155
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,760
Can I have a fuck you?

1156
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
No, I guess not.

1157
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,760
All right.

1158
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,760
So if anyone has a link to that, I couldn't find it that easily on YouTube.

1159
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Now they started to clean it up and are basically ruined YouTube.

1160
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
It's no good.

1161
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:09,760
You know, I actually, I got some music to go with the last part of the show for today.

1162
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,760
It's time to save America, ladies and gentlemen.

1163
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,760
Save us from the insanity that is the departments like Homeland Security.

1164
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,760
And let's save us from the IRS stealing the fruits of our labor.

1165
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,760
I've been looking for a candidate to endorse in the upcoming 2008 presidential elections.

1166
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,760
You know, I've been doing as much research as I possibly can.

1167
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,760
Some people have been joining in and helping out, for instance, Craig Meyer,

1168
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,760
went to opensecrets.org.

1169
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,760
And he says he put together a spreadsheet of contributions for John McCain.

1170
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,760
Remember, I told you if you looked at opensecrets.org, you can see what corporations and why

1171
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
that's listed, I don't really know.

1172
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,760
But you can see which corporations have donated through individuals.

1173
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,760
The maximum amount of each individual being a couple thousand dollars.

1174
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,760
You can see what companies they work for.

1175
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,760
So he, he touted it all up and came up with some very interesting results.

1176
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,760
The most amount of money came for John McCain.

1177
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,760
That is, came from people who marked down they were retired.

1178
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
Second was self-employed.

1179
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,760
Third was homemaker.

1180
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,760
Four was empty.

1181
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,760
And then check out these interesting companies.

1182
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,760
The federal expressed $24,000.

1183
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,760
Merrill Lynch in aggregate $18,000.

1184
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
MGM grand.

1185
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
That's no tell.

1186
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,760
$9,000.

1187
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,760
Nice comp room there.

1188
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,760
Blanche, a blank and room LLP.

1189
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,760
I think it's a hedge fund.

1190
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,760
Echo star, AT&T, Liberty media.

1191
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,760
Now, that's very interesting.

1192
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,760
I'm sure that these are people who, somehow, I guess they get their employees to either

1193
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:58,760
do a drive or, or they maybe they coerce them into aggregating their maximum amounts of

1194
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,760
money donated to a candidate.

1195
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,760
And they come up with some interesting amounts.

1196
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,760
FedEx had 14 people donate.

1197
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,760
And I presume that if they put FedEx down on their donations,

1198
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,760
it's because they want FedEx to be associated with the donation.

1199
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,760
Why else would you do it?

1200
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,760
You could also just say I'm a self-employed or a delivery worker.

1201
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,760
Or in that case, maybe a pilot.

1202
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,760
I don't know if you were for federal express.

1203
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,760
So anyway, I've been looking for a candidate.

1204
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,760
I don't give a shit what party affiliation they are.

1205
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
I just want to get behind somebody.

1206
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,760
Someone who, at least have some kind of message that is something that changes.

1207
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,760
And well, some random endorsement started to come in through the phone line.

1208
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,760
So I guess someone in the

1209
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,760
Ron Paul campaign or just some enthusiastic supporters

1210
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,760
handed out the phone number.

1211
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,760
Let's listen to a couple of them for a second here.

1212
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,760
And this is Dan from Maine.

1213
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,760
If you've got the, you know,

1214
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,760
if you're looking for a presidential candidate to support,

1215
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,760
I got one for you.

1216
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,760
And the war on drugs,

1217
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,760
end of the war in Iraq.

1218
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,760
Leave the internet completely alone.

1219
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,760
Reduce the power of the presidency.

1220
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,760
Restore basic human and constitutional rights.

1221
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,760
The U.S. citizens closed military bases around the world.

1222
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,760
Cut federal spending.

1223
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,760
And the sky rocks.

1224
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,760
Of course, this is Ron Paul.

1225
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,760
Paul Paul.

1226
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,760
So you can imagine.

1227
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,760
I'm here on that.

1228
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,760
I'm going like, wait a minute.

1229
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,760
And in the war on drugs,

1230
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,760
drastically reduced government spending.

1231
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,760
Close military.

1232
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,760
I'm like, wait a minute.

1233
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,760
This guy is starting to take all the boxes here for me.

1234
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
And that all of a sudden I get this call.

1235
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,760
This is fantastic.

1236
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,760
This is the stoner from Houston, Texas calling again.

1237
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,760
This is my second shot at this.

1238
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,760
I thought the first one sucked.

1239
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,760
I was nervous.

1240
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,760
So I figured you won't want to use this on the air.

1241
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,760
And if you did that, the first one sucked.

1242
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,760
And this I want to hopefully better.

1243
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,760
So I'll serve him to catch.

1244
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
Sorry.

1245
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,760
Sorry for asking Houston, Texas.

1246
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,760
I was listening to your DSC-670.

1247
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,760
And heard that you were looking for a presidential candidate.

1248
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,760
I highly recommend you check out Ron Paul.

1249
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,760
He's a Texas congressman.

1250
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,760
Been in the congress for 10 terms now.

1251
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,760
He is for the constitution.

1252
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,760
There's a huge, huge grassroots movement going on in the United States right now.

1253
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,760
He's raising lots of money.

1254
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,760
He got $5 million.

1255
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,760
He's got a lot of fantastic ideas.

1256
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:49,760
You know, I hear you when you say that you're frustrated with all the crap that's going on with this war on terror.

1257
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,760
And you know, having people with the airports and all the stuff.

1258
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,760
You know, it's just terrible.

1259
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,760
Anyway, long time listeners, go all the way back to before you call the DSC.

1260
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,760
Never called in before, but I want to say,

1261
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,760
Hi, let you know who I'm going for in the United States.

1262
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,760
And, well, folder.

1263
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,760
And he wants to realize marijuana.

1264
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,760
Wow.

1265
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,760
I'm like, okay.

1266
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,760
Now here's a guy.

1267
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,760
I can get behind.

1268
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,760
And so I start to investigate Ron Paul.

1269
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,760
Dr. Ron Paul.

1270
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,760
Very interesting guy.

1271
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,760
He's a Republican.

1272
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,760
And I've said before that if anything, my family is certainly quite Republican.

1273
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,760
And I probably have a lot of Republican in me.

1274
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,760
I've not definitely not always voted Republican.

1275
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:44,760
Certainly more Democrat and independent once or twice in the years that I've been been allowed to vote.

1276
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,760
And so this guy, he was an obstetric, no OBGYN.

1277
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Is that what it is?

1278
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,760
He's delivered 4,000 babies into the world.

1279
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,760
Of course, he's old enough to have done that throughout his medical career.

1280
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,760
And this guy's really interesting.

1281
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:07,760
The whole thing is, look, there's a document that the founding fathers of the United States put together.

1282
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,760
It's called the Constitution.

1283
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,760
And it's been violated consistently throughout its history.

1284
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,760
And it's time to ratchet it back and get back to the basics.

1285
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,760
And I'm like, okay, that's pretty interesting.

1286
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,760
You know, I've read the Constitution.

1287
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,760
I stand by it.

1288
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,760
I'm an American.

1289
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:36,760
I totally believe in the founding fathers and their strength and their wisdom that they were writing the blueprint for a great country.

1290
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,760
And so I went to YouTube.

1291
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,760
I want to play for you a couple of pieces from this was,

1292
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,760
there's a whole, I know of course I put links in the show notes to this.

1293
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,760
YouTube page, which has a whole bunch of Ron Paul related video.

1294
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:02,760
This was, I think, a debate amongst Republicans in, let me see if it says you're South Carolina.

1295
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,760
Yeah, it's the, okay, it's the GOP presidential debate.

1296
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,760
And there's a whole bunch of questions for Ron Paul.

1297
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,760
I think really, they're worth listening to.

1298
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,760
Hold on a second.

1299
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,760
Let me just queue it up here.

1300
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,760
So I can't resist the big fanfare.

1301
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,760
Because it's about the elections of the free world, everyone.

1302
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,760
It's the bomb fasting on a microphone once again.

1303
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,760
All right.

1304
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,760
Let's listen to a couple of these questions.

1305
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,760
I'm just going to tell you that six of the publicans are back in 2000,

1306
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,760
to vote against or authorize and president Bush to use force in Iraq.

1307
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,760
Now you say we should pull our troops out.

1308
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,760
A recent poll found that 70, 7% of Republicans,

1309
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,760
disapprove of the idea of setting a timetable for withdrawal.

1310
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,760
Are you running for the nomination of the wrong party?

1311
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,760
But you, you have to realize that the base of the Republican party shrunk last year

1312
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,760
because of the war issue.

1313
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,760
You've got to kind of get past his voice.

1314
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,760
He sounds a little Ross Perouille.

1315
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,760
And I'm sure he looks much taller than Ross Perouille.

1316
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,760
But that's the only bummer about him.

1317
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,760
But listen to what this guy has to say.

1318
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,760
It's really interesting.

1319
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,760
That percentage represents less people.

1320
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,760
If you look at 65 to 70% of the American people,

1321
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,760
they want us out of there.

1322
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,760
They want the war over.

1323
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,760
In 2002, I offered an amendment to international relations

1324
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,760
to declare war up or down.

1325
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,760
And it was nobody voted for the war.

1326
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,760
My argument there was if we wanted to go to war

1327
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,760
and if we should go to war, the Congress should declare it.

1328
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,760
We don't go to war like we did in Vietnam and Korea

1329
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,760
because the war is never in.

1330
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,760
And I argued the case and made the point that it would be a

1331
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,760
quagmar if we go in.

1332
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,760
Ronald Reagan in 1983 sent Marines into Lebanon.

1333
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,760
And he said he would never turn tail and run.

1334
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,760
A few months later, Marines were killed 241 were killed

1335
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,760
and the Marines were taken out.

1336
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,760
Reagan addressed this subject in his memoirs.

1337
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,760
And he says, I said, I would never turn tail and run.

1338
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,760
He says, but I never realize the irrationality

1339
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,760
of Middle Eastern politics and he changed his policy there.

1340
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,760
We need the courage of Ronald Reagan.

1341
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,760
Which I think is really great.

1342
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,760
You know, because he's talking to the Republican party.

1343
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,760
He's a member of the Republican party.

1344
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,760
And he's voted against going into Iraq.

1345
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,760
And he's saying some really sensible stuff.

1346
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,760
He's saying, we got no business doing that.

1347
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,760
These long-term wars, the wars, they suck.

1348
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,760
They're no good for us.

1349
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,760
But he's right up there.

1350
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:42,760
Fighting, I guess, which would be the other candidates.

1351
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,760
We'll have to see who else is up there.

1352
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,760
Rudy Giuliani is certainly one of them who's on in this panel.

1353
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,760
Listen to the next question.

1354
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,760
Brian from Fort Wayne asks this question via the editor

1355
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,760
that a question about controlling government spending.

1356
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,760
Congressman Paul, can you tell me three federal programs

1357
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,760
you consider wasteful and would eliminate?

1358
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,760
I'd start with the departments.

1359
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,760
Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security,

1360
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,760
which we've just, the Republicans put in the Department of Homeland Security.

1361
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,760
It's a monstrous type of bureaucracy.

1362
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,760
It was supposed to be streamlining our security and it's unmanageable.

1363
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,760
I mean, just think of the efficiency of FEMA.

1364
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,760
And it's efforts to take care of the floods and the hurricanes.

1365
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,760
So yes, there's a lot of things that we can cut.

1366
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,760
But we can't cut anything until we change our philosophy about why governments should do.

1367
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:40,760
If you think we can continue to police the world and spend hundreds of billions of dollars overseas,

1368
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:45,760
and spend hundreds of billions of dollars running a welfare state and entitlement system

1369
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:51,760
that has accumulated $60 trillion worth of obligations and think that we can run the economy

1370
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,760
this way.

1371
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:57,760
We spend so much money now that we have to borrow nearly $3 billion a day from foreigners

1372
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,760
to take care of our consumption.

1373
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,760
And we can't afford that.

1374
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,760
We can't afford it in the government.

1375
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,760
We can't afford it as a nation.

1376
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:09,760
So tax reform should come but spending cuts have to come by changing our attitude

1377
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,760
what government ought to be doing for us.

1378
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,760
Listen to that.

1379
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,760
And he's going to get rid of all the crazy ass departments.

1380
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,760
Wow.

1381
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,760
I think I'm in love.

1382
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,760
Department of Homeland Security in the midst of a war, sir.

1383
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,760
Well, I think we should not go to more bureaucracy.

1384
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,760
It didn't work.

1385
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,760
We were spending $40 billion on security prior to 9.11.

1386
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:35,760
And they had all the information they needed there to deal with the threat.

1387
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,760
And it was inefficiency.

1388
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,760
So what do we do?

1389
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:44,760
We add a gigantic bureaucracy which they're still working on trying to put it together

1390
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,760
and tremendous amount of increase in funds.

1391
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,760
So I don't think that the Republican position ought to be more bureaucracy.

1392
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,760
I mean, why did we double the size of the Department of Education?

1393
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,760
Yeah, man.

1394
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,760
It's really, really dirty from here.

1395
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:05,760
Rudy Giuliani is about to jump in and totally play the 9.11 card.

1396
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,760
But this guy is saying some really sensible stuff.

1397
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,760
I was looking around.

1398
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,760
Hold on.

1399
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,760
Let me just pick up another quote from him.

1400
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,760
Listen to another one of these endorsements.

1401
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,760
I got like 50 of them.

1402
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,760
It's amazing.

1403
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,760
Hi.

1404
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,760
This is for Adam Curry.

1405
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,760
My name is Jeffrey Schwartz.

1406
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,760
I'm a supportive Ron Paul for president.

1407
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:31,760
And I would ask Adam to look into Ron Paul 2008.com and do a Google or YouTube video search

1408
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,760
at Ron Paul and see how popular he is.

1409
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:41,760
He's the most popular candidate on the Internet and among young people.

1410
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,760
And we'd love to have you learn about him.

1411
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,760
And if you get it, possibly like him endorse him.

1412
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,760
We'd love that.

1413
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,760
So please do that.

1414
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,760
Thanks so much.

1415
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,760
Bye bye.

1416
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,760
All right.

1417
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,760
That's a fair enough question.

1418
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,760
If all endorse him, well, I have some caveats here and there.

1419
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,760
But let's listen to what Ron Paul has to say about the Internet and what his

1420
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,760
stance is about our wonderful network.

1421
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,760
It doesn't seem to be any official award, but quickly becoming also the best friend of the

1422
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,760
Internet.

1423
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,760
What do you think about the Internet?

1424
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,760
Why should that be important to people?

1425
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:29,760
Well, the Internet to me is the political equalizer of the age because we who use the

1426
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,760
Internet a whole lot and the young people who like it and others find out that they can get information

1427
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,760
that is unbiased.

1428
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,760
And evidently, there's a lot of people in this country.

1429
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,760
And especially young people who don't particularly like K and News coming from the major

1430
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,760
television networks.

1431
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,760
When I was raising my kids, you know, there was a lot of television watching.

1432
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,760
I worried about that.

1433
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,760
But I don't think kids sit and watch television as much now.

1434
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,760
They'll be watching their computers.

1435
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,760
And I think this is very good.

1436
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,760
Of course, there's always good and bad on everything.

1437
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,760
Just as there isn't any publication and television and radio and whatnot.

1438
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,760
But at least there's more honest reporting and more honest news.

1439
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,760
And you have to be more discretionary on what you're going to pick and look at.

1440
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,760
But to me, it is the true equalizer.

1441
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,760
I think we're doing very well in our campaign.

1442
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,760
A lot better than I had anticipated.

1443
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:34,760
At the same time, there are other candidates have raised a lot more money than we have.

1444
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:41,760
So we have a campaign that is growing rather rapidly, both in fundraising and number of people.

1445
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,760
But a lot of our success has come through the Internet.

1446
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:50,760
So we've literally equalized ourselves to those who have had tens of millions of dollars.

1447
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,760
The Internet, I think, is that.

1448
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,760
The Internet is the big thing.

1449
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,760
It doesn't mean that you could do everything on the Internet, but it might be the real organizer.

1450
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,760
And literally, the Internet has been spontaneous for us.

1451
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,760
But I think our candidacy is different than the others because we're philosophically motivated.

1452
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,760
And we're not a top down.

1453
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,760
We try our best to be well organized.

1454
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:22,760
True this is we have trouble keeping up with the spontaneous organizations of groups around the country.

1455
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,760
Just popping up.

1456
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,760
I mean, it's literally freedom.

1457
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,760
So when I talk about freedom, and people know about the freedom of the Internet, there must be a connection there.

1458
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,760
I have freedom of the Internet.

1459
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,760
I can look and go here and pick this and talk to my friends and all this thing.

1460
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,760
So, of course, I don't want to ever tax the Internet.

1461
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,760
I don't want to regulate the Internet.

1462
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,760
And I want that's one thing that really gives us a chance to combat.

1463
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,760
This horrendous movement to big government because we can talk to a lot of people.

1464
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,760
So I see it as very exciting and something that is very beneficial.

1465
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,760
And we ever get wind of the fact that the government wants to regulate our tax.

1466
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,760
That is a bad sign.

1467
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:07,760
Of course, it's in the winds.

1468
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,760
Even at times, they bring up the UN about regulating the Internet because it's a world phenomenon.

1469
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:17,760
I see this as a very dangerous notion, but right now, I think they're going to have a little trouble

1470
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,760
writing in the Internet, and I think it's great.

1471
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:27,760
So this guy, and all these people who called in with endorsements, you're absolutely right.

1472
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,760
He ticks almost every single box I'm looking for.

1473
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:37,760
He wants to get rid of all the departments, love that, love it.

1474
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,760
He's a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment, which is the right to bear arms.

1475
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,760
You know that I am a supporter of this.

1476
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:51,760
For one reason only, the reason why the Constitution, the founding document of the United States of America,

1477
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:59,760
has that amendment in it is in case we're in exactly this situation where the government needs to be taken out.

1478
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,760
That's what the right to bear arms is all about.

1479
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:08,760
And of course, there's many arguments for and against, but look, it's what our country was founded on.

1480
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,760
Just keep it in there.

1481
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,760
There was a reason for it.

1482
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,760
Study the documents.

1483
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,760
Look at the Constitution.

1484
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:20,760
You have the right to the fruits of your labor, which means you, it is illegal to be taxed

1485
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,760
the way the federal government is taxing you.

1486
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,760
Well, yeah, love that.

1487
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,760
Don't turn it into welfare state.

1488
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,760
Yes, absolutely.

1489
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,760
I've been a supporter of this for all my life.

1490
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,760
I've lived in welfare states.

1491
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,760
I hate it.

1492
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,760
I think it's destructive demoralizing.

1493
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,760
And America, that's what we're about.

1494
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:46,760
It's where we're about the American dream, making a buck philanthropy, helping your neighbors.

1495
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,760
Oh, yes.

1496
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:55,760
Now, he also is a strong supporter of overturning the Roe versus Wade.

1497
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,760
Judgment, I guess what you call it.

1498
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:03,760
And I think I really have to go back and reread what it's about.

1499
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,760
He is saying, what, so here's where I can agree with him because, of course, I'm not a woman.

1500
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,760
I don't know what it's like to be pregnant or even contemplated abortion.

1501
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,760
That's a very heavy topic that I just can't really, I just am not qualified to discuss it.

1502
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,760
But he's saying, look, you know, we need to protect life.

1503
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,760
He believes life starts with conception.

1504
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,760
Now, of course, he's a doctor, a medical doctor.

1505
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,760
So I can understand why he has a different view on the miracle of life.

1506
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:37,760
So religious, and he says somewhere in one of these videos, he says, that is my burden to bear,

1507
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,760
which I like the way he positioned that.

1508
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
And you know, it's like, hey, I believe in God.

1509
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,760
I believe in creation and not an evolution.

1510
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,760
And that's my problem that I got.

1511
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,760
And I like that.

1512
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,760
That's great.

1513
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,760
Absolutely, it's your problem.

1514
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,760
And we have no problem because you're not going to push it on me.

1515
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,760
I'm not going to push anything on you.

1516
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,760
So that's fantastic.

1517
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,760
And he says the only thing he wants to remove.

1518
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,760
And I, that's why I need to go back and reread Roe versus Wade.

1519
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,760
He says, I do not believe that the government should be paying for abortion.

1520
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,760
Okay.

1521
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,760
So that's something that we can discuss, but everything else.

1522
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,760
You know, and stopping the war against drugs.

1523
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,760
He says, that's that's crazy.

1524
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,760
The war against drugs.

1525
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,760
He says, it's nuts.

1526
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:21,760
We have, you know, three million black American males in prison because of marijuana.

1527
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,760
You know my, my stance on that.

1528
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,760
So this guy really has got my attention.

1529
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,760
One more of those endorsements.

1530
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,760
Hi out of my name is Jane Evan.

1531
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,760
I'm from Oklahoma.

1532
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,760
I was just going to let you know that prison can make you should be supporting as

1533
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,760
Ron Paul is my opinion.

1534
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:42,760
I support Ron Paul because he is an honest man and has voted the same for 30 years.

1535
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,760
Now, particularly because I agree with those ideas.

1536
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,760
Although that's obviously a nice bonus.

1537
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,760
I think we need somebody that we can trust and we'll bring transparent government.

1538
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,760
Open source government for once.

1539
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,760
Because I'm going to keep the internet free and unregulated.

1540
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,760
It opposes taxing it in many ways.

1541
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,760
It's the free market words.

1542
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,760
The internet's perfect example of it.

1543
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,760
Ron Paul is the only man for me.

1544
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,760
Thanks.

1545
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,760
And by the way, if you're going to call in and endorse anyone, please end with

1546
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,760
Fuck you.

1547
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,760
I don't curry.

1548
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,760
Interesting.

1549
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,760
So here's, here's what I'd say.

1550
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,760
I'd say that just in what I've been reading.

1551
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:26,760
Of course, I'm very open to contradictory opinions.

1552
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:32,760
So if there's something I should know about Dr. Ron Paul, then please let me know.

1553
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,760
But so far, I have to agree with everyone that's called in.

1554
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,760
This is exactly my kind of guy.

1555
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,760
I feel really, really good about it.

1556
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,760
And I will go to bat for this candidate.

1557
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,760
So here's what I'd like to do.

1558
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,760
First of all, I can endorse him until I've spoken with him.

1559
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,760
So whoever runs the campaign, whatever your contact is, you've got to set it up.

1560
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:56,760
So I can talk to him on this show because I have some questions to ask.

1561
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:03,760
So that's going to get his, I will endorse him if he calls in on this show.

1562
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,760
I will, I might wind up endorsing him anyway because I got to endorse somebody.

1563
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,760
Otherwise, what a useless, useless man I would be.

1564
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,760
If I didn't endorse somebody.

1565
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,760
But if we can get him to call in and I can talk to him, which I think will be really good for him.

1566
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,760
And I'll ask, I'll ask the questions.

1567
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,760
You know, I got my own, you send in yours.

1568
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,760
We'll take care of that.

1569
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,760
I'm looking forward to that conversation.

1570
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,760
Then I will drive.

1571
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,760
I will drive.

1572
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:37,760
I think that we can, we can get this guy elected if we really want to.

1573
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:44,760
And if, again, if I can get the conversation and I can really satisfy all of the questions I have,

1574
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,760
then I will go all out for him.

1575
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,760
And we're going to track it.

1576
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,760
We're going to track and we're going to raise a shit load of money for this guy.

1577
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,760
Okay.

1578
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:00,760
I mean a shit load right now Hillary Clinton set to do 100 million before the end of the year.

1579
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,760
Barack Obama somewhere in the 40, 50 millions.

1580
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,760
So he's only at a tenth.

1581
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:13,760
Dr. Ron Paul's only at a tenth or less of what the democratic potentials have.

1582
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:21,760
But I guess and this is kind of where my knowledge of how sad is it that I don't exactly understand how the.

1583
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:28,760
The elections work with the primaries and and there's one kind of disconcerning note is that I heard in one of the or saw in one of these interviews.

1584
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,760
He said, look, if I don't make the Republican nomination.

1585
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,760
Which of course has to do with the primaries.

1586
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,760
Then I will not run. I will not run as an independent.

1587
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,760
So I guess we've got to get him to win the Republican nomination first.

1588
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:50,760
And I think as a part of that, if you are not registered as a Republican and you want to vote in the primaries.

1589
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,760
I'm just repeating stuff that I've read.

1590
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:55,760
You have to register today is like the deadline.

1591
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,760
Today the 12th, the 12th of October.

1592
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,760
So you might want to do that.

1593
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,760
Check this guy out Ron Paul 2008 dot com.

1594
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,760
And you know, here's another thing we're going to do.

1595
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,760
So if we.

1596
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,760
And again, I got to talk to the guy first.

1597
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:20,760
But could you imagine if if you donate and instead of putting down federal express, you put down DSC.

1598
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,760
I'll cool with that.

1599
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,760
And we could tally him up because he had much money we made.

1600
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,760
And you know, all I really want is I don't need any special consideration.

1601
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,760
I don't need anything for the internet.

1602
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,760
He's already made his opinion clear.

1603
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,760
So I'm good to go with that.

1604
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,760
I just got to talk to the guy.

1605
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,760
Get him on the phone for me.

1606
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:44,760
And I will be a loyal supporter forever.

1607
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,760
And regardless of that, hats off to anyone.

1608
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,760
Anybody, all of the candidates who actually have the guts to go out there and say, hey, I think I can do a good job.

1609
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,760
I think I can run this country.

1610
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,760
So, you know, that is by definition a very patriotic thing and it's just extremely cool.

1611
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,760
So, you know what?

1612
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:07,760
After I'm done with the show today and it's been a long one.

1613
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,760
So I'm going to play one more song and then get out.

1614
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,760
I'll play like one, two, three, four.

1615
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,760
Like five more of those Ron Paul endorsements.

1616
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,760
I just want you to hear.

1617
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,760
You don't have to tune into.

1618
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,760
You can just stop the show after I'm done.

1619
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:23,760
One more email, though, from Jesse, minor, Adam thought you'd enjoy this political track by the dead candidates.

1620
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:27,760
Yes, sure, maybe little dated with the particular references.

1621
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:32,760
But the sentiment is current and totally in line with your current red pill, follow the money discussion.

1622
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,760
So please do enjoy.

1623
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,760
Of course, you tease a few episodes ago.

1624
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,760
You're going to play a moon over Marin by the dead candidates from the pod save music network, but you didn't.

1625
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:43,760
So, hey, dead candidates definitely a part of the soundtrack to my life.

1626
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,760
Could you give it a whirl?

1627
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,760
Dude, absolutely.

1628
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,760
And boy, is it right on the money considering this track as what?

1629
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,760
10, 15 years old?

1630
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,760
Pinky sex makes the world go round.

1631
01:08:53,760 --> 01:09:04,760
7, 20, 20, 20, 30...

1632
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:23,540
...

1633
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:28,540
The State Department of the United States, we have a problem.

1634
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:34,540
The companies want something down about the sluggish world economic situation.

1635
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:38,540
Travits have been running farer than a little thin lately.

1636
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,540
We need to stimulate some growth.

1637
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:48,540
Now we know that there's a alarmingly high enough of young people roaming around in your country

1638
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:53,540
to do the stir up trouble for the police and damage private property.

1639
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:56,540
All of us will try to leverage it and shop.

1640
01:09:56,540 --> 01:10:00,540
It's about time we did something destructive with these people.

1641
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:02,540
We won thousands of near-two.

1642
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,540
They're crawling all over.

1643
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:08,540
The companies think it's time we lost it down.

1644
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:12,540
The series get together and start another war.

1645
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:16,540
President Paul, we need to love the idea.

1646
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:21,540
All of us will be streaming over hands to grow deeper.

1647
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:25,540
People running down the road to get on fire.

1648
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:27,540
Oh, don't get steam up for us.

1649
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:30,540
Or the criminals that get changed for the real thing.

1650
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:31,540
Three years.

1651
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,540
Whoa.

1652
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,540
We're running a little going away forever for Mr. Freshnath.

1653
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:36,540
Oh, hell.

1654
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,540
I can't stand so fun.

1655
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,540
What do you say?

1656
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:43,540
Well, we don't even have to win this war.

1657
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,540
We just want to cut down on some of these things.

1658
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,540
That's the situation.

1659
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,540
Now let's just sign up the draft.

1660
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:53,540
The draft is many of those people we can.

1661
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,540
We'll call up every last yunkster.

1662
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:58,540
We can get our hands on it.

1663
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:02,540
Give them an hour or two to learn how to use an automatic rifle.

1664
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:04,540
Send them on their way.

1665
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,540
Now let's go on.

1666
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,540
Now I'm Northern Ireland.

1667
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:08,540
I'm Northern Ireland.

1668
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,540

I'm Northern Ireland.

1720
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,040
Better needs since we took over.

1721
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:14,040
Just like Vietnam, we had everybody so busy with LSD, they never got to run.

1722
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,040
Get the Lord functioning just fine.

1723
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,040
It's easy.

1724
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,040
Well, we got our college kids so interested in beer.

1725
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,040
They don't even hear us.

1726
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,040
We've got many factors driven again.

1727
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,040
Oh, and if they're spotpiled, they're back out.

1728
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,040
They wouldn't even know what it looked like.

1729
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,040
Oh, how about it?

1730
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1731
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,040
Bro, here's money.

1732
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,040
The Army's manufacturing is telling me,

1733
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:39,040
unless we get our bomb factories of the poor production

1734
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,040
the whole economy is going to collapse.

1735
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,040
The fog is during the same boat.

1736
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,040
We all agree the time has come to the big one.

1737
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,040
What do you say?

1738
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:50,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1739
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,040
That's excellent.

1740
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,040
We knew you to agree.

1741
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,040
The companies will be very pleased.

1742
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:02,040
What day is it today?

1743
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,040
It's Friday.

1744
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,040
Monday Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

1745
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,040
Food about Friday, Adam's final fun on the Wii.

1746
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,040
Well, there you go.

1747
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:16,040
The soundtrack to your life tells you some things about the future.

1748
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,040
Don't they know?

1749
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,040
Wow, man.

1750
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,040
Spin that.

1751
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,040
What is this?

1752
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,040
I were in 13 minutes crap.

1753
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,040
I hope you guys had time to sit through all of this with me.

1754
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,040
Final thought of the Wii.

1755
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,040
Well, for me, it's just going to be thinking about Ron Paul.

1756
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,040
I'm liking this guy.

1757
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,040
I could totally, you know, he can't be any worse than anyone else.

1758
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,040
And the whole idea of, you know, look, you want my agenda.

1759
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,040
Look at the Constitution.

1760
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,040
We're taking it back.

1761
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:43,040
We're taking it back to those days.

1762
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,040
And, yeah.

1763
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,040
Again, if you have a contrary in view,

1764
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,040
I'd love to hear it.

1765
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,040
You know the phone numbers that are on the data source code.com.

1766
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,040
Curry.com.

1767
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:57,040
And I would say, for me, to really go all out on this.

1768
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,040
Again, I've got to speak to the man.

1769
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,040
So the call is out.

1770
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:03,040
Follow those people who called in and dorsing in.

1771
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,040
Get a hold of them.

1772
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,040
Let's set it up with a phone call.

1773
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,040
A little phone or a button.

1774
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,040
We'll just talk to them.

1775
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:11,040
So those five extra endorsements that I think are worth listening to,

1776
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,040
coming up right up after, after he closed down the show.

1777
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,040
And I will be back Monday, guaranteed.

1778
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,040
Adam and podshow.com.

1779
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,040
DailySourceco.com.

1780
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,040
Thank you for listening.

1781
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:25,040
Live life with passion and have a great weekend.

1782
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:29,040
Take those day food by Friday.

1783
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,040
Adam's final thought of the week.

1784
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,040
Oh, yeah.

1785
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,040
And follow the money.

1786
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,040
Another podshow podcast.

1787
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,040
Stick it in your ear.

1788
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,040
Hey, this is Anthony machine.

1789
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,040
That's a dozen entirely clear.

1790
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,040
That I do hope that I'm calling Adam Curry's show.

1791
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:54,040
I'm calling specifically because Adam seems to be thinking for a bit of an independent

1792
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,040
support.

1793
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:59,040
And I am really hoping that he will take a close look at Dr. Ron Paul,

1794
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,040
who is running for president.

1795
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,040
The Republic can pick it.

1796
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,040
Unlike many Republicans, of course.

1797
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:08,040
Dr. Paul is against the Iraq war.

1798
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,040
And that's going to get some beginning.

1799
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:14,040
He's also an incredibly strong component of tribal liberties.

1800
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:20,040
And the basic philosophy of government is that it should only exist to protect the people's

1801
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:23,040
life, liberty, and the truth of happiness, and other than that.

1802
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:27,040
The government should just leave the people alone to do their own thing,

1803
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:32,040
make their own lives, and make their own decisions about how they want to live.

1804
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:40,040
So I was just calling to really encourage Adam to take a look at Dr. Paul.

1805
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:45,040
You can go to RonPaul2008.com or just Google the name Ron Paul.

1806
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,040
They're all kind to create the best.

1807
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,040
Thanks so much.

1808
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,040
And my name is Betty Wolff.

1809
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,040
And my number is 2-0-3.

1810
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,040
If you want 4-0-6-9-8.

1811
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,040
All right.

1812
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,040
My name is Joe.

1813
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:07,040
And I heard that you were looking to use your podcast influence and raise money for a presidential candidate.

1814
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,040
You know who?

1815
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,040
Well, I'll tell you who.

1816
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,040
RonPaul.

1817
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:18,040
He's the last hope that we have that's seeing the restoration of liberty and to Americans.

1818
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:23,040
So you should definitely help promote RonPaul on your station.

1819
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,040
I hope you.

1820
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,040
All right.

1821
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:30,040
You should support RonPaul because he's the only conservative running for office.

1822
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:35,040
He's against the Iraq War and American imperialism in general.

1823
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,040
He supports lower taxes, limited government.

1824
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,040
He was against the war on Joe so he should have done nothing for his country.

1825
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,040
He should have wasted money.

1826
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,040
There's a range of issues.

1827
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:51,040
I think if you look to him up and when he goes up, I think he probably agree with that.

1828
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:55,040
And there's RonPaul from South Carolina.

1829
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,040
Hey Adam.

1830
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,040
This is Chris.

1831
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,040
The stone or Chris Stone from Houston Texas.

1832
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:08,040
He's just wanted to call and say that I heard you on DSE 670.

1833
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,040
And heard that you were looking for a presidential candidate.

1834
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:15,040
I highly recommend that you check out RonPaul.

1835
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:18,040
He's a Texas congressman.

1836
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,040
Ten terms in Congress.

1837
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,040
And amazing man.

1838
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,040
A lot of people say that he's a Republican.

1839
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,040
By the way, a lot of people say that he can't win.

1840
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:33,040
Honestly, there is a huge huge grassroots movement going on right now.

1841
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,040
The United States and actually worldwide.

1842
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:40,040
You can check him out by going to Google, Google and RonPaul or you can go to YouTube.

1843
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:45,040
Just search for RonPaul or you can go to romPaul.meatup.com.

1844
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:56,040
And you can find that right now he has over 53,000 people on meetup.com that are voluntary for hot stuff going on with him.

1845
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:59,040
He's got a great message for the Constitution.

1846
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:02,040
He's an honest man of surprise and link.

1847
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:06,040
Well, you know, there's nobody honest in the Congress right now.

1848
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,040
So for him.

1849
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:11,040
And he would make a fantastic president check him out.

1850
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,040
And folder.

1851
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,040
Bye.

1852
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,040
Hello Adam.

1853
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:20,040
If you want to endorse the candidate for your president,

1854
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,040
look at RonPaul.

1855
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,040
RonPaul, 2008.com.

1856
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,040
He's a fantastic dude.

1857
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,040
Red.

1858
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,040
Can't vote him.

1859
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,040
Here's your guy.

1860
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,040
Bye.

1861
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,040
RonPaul.

1862
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,040
