1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
Hey everybody, daily source code episode 523, how you doing?

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,440
I got nothing but boxes.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,200
Tiny boxes, big boxes, little boxes.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,080
The only thing still standing in the studio here at the curry cottage is the desk, is

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,000
the podcast console.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,840
And the big gree ugly green thing, which soon will be just a memory, as it has to go

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,600
into deep deep storage, since it will not fit through the doorway up to the third floor studio

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,680
in the brand new cottage, which summer now calling the curry tower, which I got to see

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,960
if that'll grow on me or not.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,520
Anyway, a time for another best of charity today, as we are completing the big move of

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,720
2007, it's a mess, I gotta tell you.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,880
And of course portions of today's show brought to you by Splenda, as well as by Stomp the

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,760
Yard, brand new movie coming out in just four days from now, yeah, four days from now on

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,000
the 12th of January, go to StompthePodcast.com to find out more.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And by the way, I have had some time to check out some of the CES coverage that's been

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
going on.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,880
Pod Show is at CES as well.

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,480
At the AMD Live booth, as we're presenting the first demo of Pod Show TV, which is essentially

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,760
a version of Pod Show Plus on IPTV, and it's fucking cool.

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,800
So that's something we can look forward to to 2007.

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,280
I saw the Bill Gates keynote, I don't know what, I don't know what, I don't know what

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,880
it was kind of bland, actually.

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:43,080
And you know what the demos when Bill Gates does the demos versus a demo from Steve Jobs,

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,040
I guess what is it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, we have another Mac world and so of

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,960
course we'll have another stellar performance from Steve.

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,240
Whenever the Microsoft guys do a do demos, it just doesn't feel right, it feels like, yeah,

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,080
you know, what's going on behind the scenes, they never quite completed to make it feel

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,280
like this will actually work at your place.

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,120
Anyway, it's still very happy with my Windows machine, but I, no one has convinced me yet

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,840
why I need to upgrade to Windows Vista, although I'm sure the next machine I buy will

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
have it built in.

32
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,320
Okay, so I'm going to use this best of Charlie since it is a musical theme best

33
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,160
of Charlie produced by PD Love, I'm going to use that as some packing music for myself

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,960
here and the gang from smart movers who are helping us out, I've been packing a lot of

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,040
my own stuff mainly because as we've gone through this before, it's my stuff.

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,840
So when else is stuff, well, that's just purely shit.

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,000
Hey, here we're in, but I, sorry, could resist.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,800
Thanks DSC listeners, I am PD Love, the guest host of this best of Charlie, and I just

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
introduce myself.

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,520
I do several podcasts, namely Love House Radio, for showcasing a mix of pot-sake music

41
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,960
artists in genres, and the daddy cast, a podcast for the parenting community focusing on

42
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,720
advice for dads and stories of my life with my two boys.

43
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,080
Perhaps you've heard my voice a little bit on some of the intros for the daily source code

44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,200
or way back when in the second life talks.

45
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,880
But other theme for this show for this best of Charlie is Music of 2006.

46
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,840
It's a review of the music that Adam has played over the course of the past year.

47
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,760
Basically I went through Adam's show notes and put together a playlist of songs he seemed

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,000
to enjoy based on the number of times he's played each song.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,600
Put it together and based on my research, the best played song of the DSC in 2006 was

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Liberty Jones.

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,640
So let's get the show started with the shakes and Liberty Jones.

52
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:42,160
Ever nearly Liberty Jones works in the shop that she owns.

53
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,840
Lessons to music like swing.

54
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:58,960
When there's no customer's in, just because she don't like to drive, takes us to see

55
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,040
you don't mind back to my face.

56
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:43,520
Music shows something, why don't you go for me, take me away and lie to you.

57
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:28,480
Music shows something, why don't you go for me, take me away and lie to you.

58
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:39,960
Music shows something, why don't you go for me, take me away and lie to you.

59
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:48,920
Music shows something, why don't you go for me, take me away and lie to you.

60
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:28,920
Music shows something, why don't you go for me, take me away and lie to you.

61
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:35,560
Music shows something, why don't you go for me, take me away and lie to you.

62
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Music shows something, why don't you go for me, take me away and lie to you.

63
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:50,760
Music shows something, why don't you go for me, take me away and lie to you.

64
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,520
Music shows something, why don't you go for me, take me away and lie to you.

65
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Music shows something, why don't you go for me, take me away and lie to you.

66
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Music shows something, why don't you go for me, take me away and lie to you.

67
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
If I'm in the country

68
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
On the island

69
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
No one is the United Kingdom

70
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
Liberty Jones

71
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
You could find them on the podcast music network

72
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Gosh, I love that

73
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
What a great song

74
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Really, really good

75
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,520
So we're getting some shape done that isn't gentlemen

76
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
And lacking it very much

77
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,520
And keep the comments coming for Shadow Falls, man

78
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
People are loving this

79
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Shadow Falls.podshow.com

80
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,520
And part of the appeal is got to be the music

81
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Munk has really outclassed himself this time

82
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Into a whole new level

83
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,520
This song kicks so much ass

84
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,520
It's Molly Steen

85
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,520
I am

86
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,520
From PMM

87
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm just begun

88
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
I was dead

89
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,520
For us to be

90
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,520
That swings both ways

91
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,520
You've never asked my name

92
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,520
I am here

93
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
I am here

94
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
I am here

95

I am here

96
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
I am here

97
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
I am here

98
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
I am alive

99
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,520
I am alive

100
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,520
I am there for a reason

101
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
I am here

102
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,520
I am here

103
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,520

I am here

107
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,520
I am there for a reason

108
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,520
I am there for a reason

112
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,520
I am here

113
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
I am here

114
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
I am here

115

I am here

116
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
I am here

117
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
I am there

118
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,520

124
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,800
your 2007 with a little splendor. What's your flavor? Now let's change the flavor of our music

125
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,200
with a little Howard Jones and Kevin Reed. This is something that really, really tickled me when it

126
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:15,600
came in this came in yesterday morning. Hi Adam. I'm not going to say who, who, um, I'll skip one

127
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,880
fight. Hi Adam. I just wanted to say thanks for playing building our own future on your podcast

128
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,080
show and big in me up. Thanks for the help with the tour dates as well. If I can be of assistance,

129
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:32,240
best wishes. Howard, that would be Howard Jones. I thought that was so awesome. Um, because of

130
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,600
course, Howard Jones, um, I know him from the early 80s, I've played so many of his songs on the

131
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,640
radio, played so many of his videos. I know actually that people under certain age don't know who

132
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,640
Howard Jones is and they play the song form, which of course is in the pod sitting music network.

133
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,560
And go, yeah, that's pretty cool. And, and some of them say, oh yeah, I think, uh, uh, uh,

134
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,360
yeah, that's the one. That's the guy. So not only did you just fantastic that he sent that note,

135
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:07,040
but then there's a PS to it. PS, he says, I'm a folder. I never thought about Howard, but make sense.

136
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,040
Here's building our own future.

137
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,040
I'm crying out the sunbeams. There's a lot of people listening.

138
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,680
Time for us to sing down a song. Try to pull them on this and then.

139
00:13:35,680 --> 00:14:05,680

Sons and daughters, brothers and daughters

146

Sons and daughters, brothers and daughters

Always have been on the road, come to me soon

148
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Sons and daughters, brothers and daughters

149
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,680
Guys, we're building a young future

150
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,680
Just from now on, day by day

151
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,680
We need to choose a life that's better

152
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,680
Oh mga !

153
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,080
Sons and daughters, brothers and daughters

154
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:23,480
While we need to choose a life that's better than before

155
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,880
Now on, day by day, we need to choose a life

156
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:46,880
He's a musical genius, I gotta say it.

157
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,280
First, it's a folder.

158
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,280
For John's building our own future, he's on tour.

159
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,960
Two or two dates will be, you can find those in the show notes, dailysourcecode.com, or even

160
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,320
on his own page at the Podsign Music Network, which of course you can find a link to in the

161
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
show notes.

162
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,040
I don't know how much of the production Howard does himself, but oh man, that snare is just

163
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
BAM!

164
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,880
It just slaps away so hard, I love it!

165
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,080
With $144 worth of MP3 players strapped to my head, and the next generation of radio content

166
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:29,080
being vibrated into my skull, I think I look like a dickhead in the pool.

167
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Alright Tom, Podsign Music Network Kevin Reeves on the Daily Sourcecode.

168
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,080
It's as late as the man that's in kick-ass.

169
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
Throw me a line.

170
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
I don't know.

171
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:51,080
I don't know.

172
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:59,080
I don't know.

173
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,080
Is there any way out of here?

174
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Is there some way to make this clear?

175
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:22,080
Because of you, I can't sleep anymore, since you walked up the door and you left me.

176
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:32,080
All I do is stare at the wall, and you know from to to all, sempre memory.

177
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:40,080
While you want to try to be insane, while you want to cause me so much pain,

178
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:47,080
I don't think I can't make it on my own, but I don't think I can't make it on my own.

179
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,080
I don't think I can't make it on my own, but I don't think I can't make it on my own.

180
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:58,080
I just pray that I'm not dying alone, but I still be silent.

181
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Tell me that you'll still live with me, but I don't think I can't.

182
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,080
I can't feel so no darkness from light.

183
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,080
I don't know daytime from night, on the free set.

184
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
Isn't real?

185
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Oh, I wake up from this, and I miss if you kiss and embrace it.

186
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,080
One day I'm in my sports room.

187
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:37,080
I don't think I can make it on my own, but I still be silent.

188
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:44,080
I don't think I can't make it on my own, but I don't think I can't make it on my own.

189
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:51,080
I don't think I can't make it on my own, but I don't think I can't make it on my own.

190
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,080
I just pray that I'm not dying alone, but I still be silent.

191
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Tell me that you'll still live with me, but I don't think I can't.

192
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,080
I can't feel so no darkness from light.

193
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,080
I don't think I can defend myself.

194
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,080
I don't think I can make it on my own, but I still be silent.

195
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Tell me that you'll still live with me, but I still love myself as if you said lie.

196
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,080
Oh, I don't think I can make it on my own, but I still can't.

197
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:40,080
I can't make it on my own

198
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,080
But throw me the fire

199
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
What a crazy life

200
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,080
My tag is wrong but long

201
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,080
But it's still inside

202
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,080
Tell me that you're still in love with me

203
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,080
What a crazy life

204
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,080
My tag is wrong but long

205
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,080
But it's still inside

206
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,080
What a crazy life

207
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,080
My tag is wrong but long

208
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,080
My tag is wrong but long

209
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,080
My tag is wrong but long

210
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,080
My tag is wrong but long

211
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
My tag is wrong but long

212
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,080
My tag is wrong but long

213
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Hey man

214
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
That's a quality shape right there

215
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
Kevin Reeves throw me a line

216
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,080
From the Podsia Music Network

217
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,080
Link in the show on today's source code

218
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
Oh yes a great tune by Kevin Reeves

219
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
When next time you have a domain name

220
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
I'll help the curries pay their new mortgage

221
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
And use the DSC codes at GoDaddy

222
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
I actually had to move my

223
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,080
TheDaddyCast.com domain

224
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
And registered theDaddyCast.org

225
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
And theDaddyCast.net

226
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,080
To last week using GoDaddy

227
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
And it was really easy

228
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,080
And plus you can enter the different codes

229
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,080
See which configuration works best for you

230
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,080
What saves you the most money

231
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Very good stuff

232
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
When this last song was submitted by Jersey Todd

233
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
And happened to be played on a day when Patricia was on the show

234
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,080
So take a listen to the unveiling of the wild bunch

235
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,080
Let's go up the way

236
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Stop it

237
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
I think you get yourself pumped up

238
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,080
I did a little rush until you got a jump up

239
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
So time up

240
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
I gotta put the table on my back

241
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
To make sure that we win and break it back

242
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
Stop

243
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Now let I know you in the building

244
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
Everybody may win in the children

245
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
We ain't gonna do the way

246
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
But more we gon' stop

247
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Till we knock the bottom out of the floor

248
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,080
To the reader

249
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
We gon' make one thing real clear

250
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
So I'm a fucking damn right here

251
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
We gon' party like this

252
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
All these

253
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,080
So I'm a real patient

254
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
And a way more money

255
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
Just don't trade it

256
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
Everybody in the house

257
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
And you ready to party

258
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080

Let me tell you something, oh, oh, oh

304
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:18,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

305

Let's stop the lead out

309
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,580
Turn down the sun her wayей

310
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,340
Don't call to the alien's on the line

311
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,460
Let's take it all off, hold

312
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,740
Feel the bad pace to tools

313
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,860
So then I'll go through

314
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,060
Stop the肉 just singing

315
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,000
No one else

316
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,220
You're gonna hard to open your mouth

317
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,580
You know we been in hard

318
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,940
But what's taking the back up

319
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,100
And from the 20 yards

320
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,300
Pick on the ramps all

321
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,580
Give it up for the team

322
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,860
An some automanz

323
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,380
To the leader

324
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,900
We don't make one thing

325
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,220
We're playing real clear.

326
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,700
So I'm a fucking damn right here.

327
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,920
We go party like this all these.

328
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,560
So you know, there's an idea.

329
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,960
The way you're my just don't care.

330
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,040
Everybody in the house is really a part of the deal.

331
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
So you know, oh, oh.

332
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Yeah.

333
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Yeah.

334
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
Yeah.

335
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Yeah.

336
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Yeah.

337
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Yeah.

338
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
Yeah.

339
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Yeah.

340
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
Yeah.

341
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
Yeah.

342
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Yeah.

343
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Woo.

344
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Oh, I love that.

345
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,940
I love that jersey Todd back with the vengeance.

346
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,640
Oh, each your heart, I'd black out.

347
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Pete.

348
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,480
Yeah, really.

349
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,240
That was awesome.

350
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,880
I wish we had a better recording.

351
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,720
That was of course was an MP3 of an MP3.

352
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
I'm sure.

353
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,040
But that sounds awesome on speed.

354
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,840
Good.

355
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,440
That was good.

356
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,480
Well, that was good.

357
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,240
Wild bunch.

358
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,040
It was a good for you.

359
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,440
It was fucking great, baby.

360
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,840
Get him on the positive music network.

361
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,240
Cheers, Todd.

362
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,840
ASAP do definitely big, big, huge.

363
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
I agree.

364
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,280
I think that could be it's got everything big.

365
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
It does.

366
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Doesn't it?

367
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,480
Oh, and you know, you're dancing right away.

368
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Even me.

369
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Yeah.

370
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
And you're not dancing.

371
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
I'm the honkyest white guy you'll ever see.

372
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Did you see me dancing?

373
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Yeah.

374
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Woo-hoo.

375
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Wow.

376
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
It's raining even harder now.

377
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Yeah.

378
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
People would think I'm wearing the shower to get.

379
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Listen.

380
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Listen.

381
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,280
There are a ton of other great artists that were played throughout 2006.

382
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,160
I'm not sure why we measured them by weight, but they were a lot.

383
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,480
And I couldn't fit them all in on this show, but we'll try to get another best of music

384
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,480
theme out before Adam gets back.

385
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,640
Also, if you like music, check out Love House Radio at Love House Radio.com, that's my

386
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
music cast.

387
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,960
I actually did a recap of the 2006 year on that show just a few days ago.

388
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,400
And if your parent or especially a father comes to the community for fathers and parents,

389
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,080
the daddycast, at thedadicast.com, like most ads, I can use all the advice I can get.

390
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,880
So, come help me out.

391
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,640
Adam thinks we're letting me host the best to Charlie with the music theme.

392
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
It's been a lot of fun.

393
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,400
And I guess we are nearing the satellite window, but always wanted to say that.

394
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,400
So we'll take it away and let PW do his mastery, but of course, subscribe to the Daily

395
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,120
