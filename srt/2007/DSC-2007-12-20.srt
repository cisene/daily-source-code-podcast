Make a statement with Sony stereo ear buds, sleek metal housings that reduce vibration

delivering killer sound from a tiny package, by yours at Sony.com-slashheadphones, Sony

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:24,880
ear buds were styled meat sound.

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,880
This year at Charlie, $701.

5
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:24,880
The people people say they're clean, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up,

6
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:54,880
they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling to turn back the war, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling out, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling up, they're calling, 4, these are calling up, they are calling, they're calling up, they're calling, they are calling up,They are calling, but they're calling, they're calling up,

7
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
Oh, what's good for saying?

8
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,880
You're getting a new male.

9
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Now pop in my eyes.

10
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Cause all of you get in jail.

11
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,880
I'm gonna pop up.

12
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Oh, I'm gonna pop up.

13
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
They're gonna pop up.

14
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
They're gonna pop up.

15
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
They're gonna pop up.

16
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Now I'm gonna pop up.

17
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Let's pop up.

18
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,880
Brought to you under the very new doctrine.

00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,880

20
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,880
to the preservation of the soundtrack of our lives.

21
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,880
I continue to turn our nut board city limits.

22
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,880
Kicking off daily source code episode 702.

23
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
I guess.

24
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
Yeah.

25
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,880
You probably have the same reaction

26
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,880
to my wife had when she heard me playing the song.

27
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,880
She's like, why are you playing that song?

28
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,880
That exactly is exactly the voice she used by the way.

29
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,880
I say, well, because he died a couple days ago.

30
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,880
And an honor of like Turner.

31
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,880
I'm gonna play one of his biggest hits.

32
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,880
In this case, happens to be one with Tina Turner.

33
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,880
He's had a lot of hits with other people in his own band.

34
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
And of course Patricia said, but he was a real asshole.

35
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,880
I know he wasn't asshole.

36
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
Of course he was.

37
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,880
You know, we all know that he abused his girlfriend slash fiance slash wife.

38
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,880
That's been well documented.

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,880
Pretty much from one side only,

40
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,880
but it's been well documented.

41
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,880
But that doesn't mean that we can't honor the guy for what he did from music.

42
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
I mean, come on.

43
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,880
He was probably the first guy to really bring this genre of R&B

44
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,880
and rock and roll together at a perfect time.

45
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,880
And he really, you know, he was a musical visionary.

46
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,880
And I have, even though I cannot condone,

47
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,880
of course any type of violence, as you know,

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
I'm a non-violent man.

49
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

50
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,880
I think he did pay the price.

51
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,880
For the abuse.

52
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,880
Because everyone thinks he's an asshole.

53
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,880
And he died a slow and horrible painful death.

54
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,880
So there you go.

55
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,880
I just can't deny the musical contribution that he made.

56
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
It is Thursday.

57
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Big apologies for Tuesday and Wednesday.

58
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
I'd already forewarned you.

59
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Once again, we're in delayed source code mode.

60
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
It'll be another three show week.

61
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,880
But it's had to get some stuff done before the end of the year.

62
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,880
And of course, I hadn't really been in the office properly for a while in the London office.

63
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
So it was a good hangout with everybody and catch up and see where we're at.

64
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
And we're doing quite well.

65
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,880
I'm just really pleased with how things are going.

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Met with a couple of content partners and producers.

67
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
That was fun too.

68
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Oh, I recorded my Ron Paul endorsement video yesterday,

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,880
which I guess they'll put up on their site sometime.

70
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
I'm not quite sure when they seem to like it.

71
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,880
You know, they're pretty, I'd say I did a pretty,

72
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,880
actually I'll put it in the daily source code channel.

73
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,880
If you haven't seen that, go to atom.podshow.com.

74
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Check out my channels.

75
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
You'll see their DSC channel.

76
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,880
And if you subscribe to that, anything that any media that I have,

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,880
I think is worthy, will pop automatically into that channel for you.

78
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,880
And you can have it go to your iPod or whatever.

79
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Your iTunes or just have it sitting there and your channel to play online.

80
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
But I had turned out okay.

81
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,880
I thought I was, the message is really what it was about.

82
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
It's funny because I showed it to Patricia last night.

83
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
She's looking at it very intensely.

84
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,880
When she looked at it intensely, I know that she's really enthralled.

85
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,880
But I think after 21 years I can tell.

86
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,880
And she says, yeah, this is very good.

87
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
And when someone says, this is very good.

88
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,880
And I'm like, all right, what don't you, what is wrong with it?

89
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
She says, well, you know, I would have, you know,

90
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,880
I couldn't see your eyes as well as I wanted to.

91
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
I would have had a little bit of light underneath to light,

92
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
to lighten up your chin.

93
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
Like, did you hear what I said?

94
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Oh, yeah, I know I like the message.

95
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Oh, my wife, bless her.

96
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,880
Oh, I also had a lunch yesterday with Simone of Altafa.

97
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Dutch listeners will remember who she is.

98
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,880
I was hoping to hook up with her again in Amsterdam for that,

99
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,880
that kind of reunion party, relaunch of decibel radio.

100
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,880
The pirate station that it all started at for me and for a number of people,

101
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
including Simone, because she was there back in the day.

102
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
She's an original pirate horror.

103
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,880
And in fact, she succeeded me on some of my TV and radio work that I did in Holland

104
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,880
when I left to go to MTV in 1986, 87.

105
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,880
And she became quite successful.

106
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,880
And she met a guy, got married,

107
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
and decided to talk it.

108
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
I'm giving up.

109
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,880
I'm going to go do something else.

110
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,880
In fact, I think she was thinking about how to save the planet at the time.

111
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,880
I don't think she's changed much nor as Clark, her husband.

112
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,880
They've been, they must be married for a good 17, 18 years by now, I think.

113
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,880
And so they're wrong around the country.

114
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Her husband is Clark Dachler.

115
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,880
He used to be a Johnny Hates Jazz.

116
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,880
If you remember them from shattered dreams,

117
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,880
that's probably the song that you remember.

118
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,880
And he's done a couple of album since then.

119
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,880
And so we had a great conversation as a new record out.

120
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
In fact, he re-recorded shattered dreams.

121
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,880
I probably couldn't, you know,

122
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
couldn't get the rights to the master.

123
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,880
I'm sure some fucked up radio record company owns that.

124
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,880
And I don't like 10 or 11 other songs.

125
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
I saw some of them.

126
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
I really like.

127
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,880
And so they actually she asked me if I would, if I would pick what I thought was,

128
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,880
you know, the best or, you know, my favorite track from the album.

129
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,880
So I'm not quite sure I can make the choice yet.

130
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,880
And she said that she'll put, she'll make him a pod safe.

131
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,880
So that's cool.

132
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,880
But it was just nice to catch up with her.

133
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,880
We had a lunch at this place called Shish, which is kind of like a Wagamama or kind of a,

134
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,880
it is a chain I believe, for Shish Kabab, which was kind of fun.

135
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,880
And as we're talking, she hasn't changed.

136
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
You know, we've known each other 25 years.

137
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,880
I said, hey, you know, I guess she remembers all this shit from back in the day.

138
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,880
And stuff that I was like, huh?

139
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,880
I really, hard for me to travel, you know, get that recollection back.

140
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,880
I said, do we ever fool around?

141
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,880
She says, no, don't you remember?

142
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,880
No.

143
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,880
I said, don't you remember when I came back to your place.

144
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,880
And I just started living on my own in Amsterdam.

145
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
And you said, hey, you know, let's just go to sleep.

146
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,880
And let's just sleep because I, you know, I like you so much.

147
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
And sex will just complicate things.

148
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
And so we slept together.

149
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
But we really just slept.

150
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
And I guess she never forgot that.

151
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
And I was like, wow.

152
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
Oh, imagine me.

153
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Maybe I still just wasn't sure about my sexuality.

154
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
I don't know.

155
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Oh, no, it's because man, she's beautiful.

156
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Anyway, looking forward to those tracks coming up soon on the podcast.

157
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Music network.

158
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Let me see.

159
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
Got a lot of email.

160
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
Of course, you know, I'm catching up myself.

161
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Oh, by the way, damn you, John C. Devorek.

162
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,880
He turned me on to this book by John Perkins called Confessions of an economic hitman.

163
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
Oh, oh, man.

164
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
I'm just getting more pissed off now.

165
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Now that I'm really starting to understand how the American Empire was able to expand so drastically.

166
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,880
And what we're really doing in all these Middle Eastern countries.

167
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,880
And you know, in other places as well, don't forget there are other countries where the United States

168
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
is adequately represented.

169
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
And why?

170
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,880
And how it has basically built up the corporateocracy and the military industrial complex.

171
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,880
And it also sounds like really, really big words and, and really tough concepts.

172
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
But it's really simple to understand once you get into it.

173
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
So I'm sure talk about that a little bit later on today.

174
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
If not on the No Agenda podcast.

175
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Hey, Adam David from Delaware.

176
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Hey, David.

177
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,880
I was cut to listen to your DSC71 straight.

178
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
And I've been inspired to call you.

179
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,880
And even though I've been a listener since the wired interview I haven't ever called.

180
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Oh, man.

181
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,880
That's a 2005.

182
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Well, thank you for hanging in there.

183
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
And to give it a little hint to the cinematographic.

184
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,880
So the listen to I just passed my 56th birthday.

185
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Nice.

186
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
It's past Sunday.

187
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Congrats.

188
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,880
I'm also an owner of the business.

189
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,880
And I really could relate to your comments about the.

190
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Listen to what's that show.

191
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
Of course.

192
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,880
You don't want to miss the your your own company's Christmas party for Led Zeppelin.

193
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
I don't give a shit.

194
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Who?

195
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Well, no.

196
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
That's not entirely true.

197
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
There would be circumstances where it probably forgot.

198
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,880
But this was just not anywhere near.

199
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Yeah, there's just stuff you had to do.

200
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
That's all there's to it.

201
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,880
I'm also on the No Fly List, which I just found out on the recent.

202
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Uh-oh.

203
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Houston.

204
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
And they're a cooperative continental agent.

205
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
Let me know.

206
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,880
That's the reason why I couldn't get my freaking morning boarding pass.

207
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
I couldn't have done anywhere.

208
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,880
And I had to go and see the people at the corner.

209
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Inspires with TFA people.

210
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
I would make a suggestion.

211
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,880
You've asked for people from Iran to call in on your line and talk to you.

212
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Give me some comments about what it's like living in Iran.

213
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,880
How about even closer to how much get some TFA people to call in and say just what

214
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,880
the hell is in their minds when they're screwing us up.

215
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Are they being instructed to just be in assholes or is it, you know, the civic constructions

216
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
about how to do that?

217
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,880
Let me just jump in here for a second.

218
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
You know, I do not.

219
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
But first of all, I'm not on a no fly list.

220
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,880
I'm on a lookout list, which is an entirely different department.

221
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,880
So the TSA is not alarmed about me at all.

222
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:42,880
The customs border protection, both by the way agencies that fall under homeland security.

223
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
They're the ones that are concerned with me.

224
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,880
So let me just say something about TSA and about airport security in general.

225
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:55,880
The people working at airport security are the same people who work with Donald's.

226
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,880
And although I just about barely trust the people working at McDonald's to give me a germ free hamburger,

227
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:09,880
I do not trust them to understand the intricacies of a screening out.

228
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Maybe even sophisticated ways of hijacking an airplane or blowing something up or whatever.

229
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
I don't expect them to have that training.

230
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,880
I don't expect them to be listening to the show.

231
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,880
And just next time you go through a US airport security, look at them.

232
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
And in fact, you can just say, I'll have a happy meal, please.

233
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,880
They'll probably reach around and want to give it to you.

234
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,880
So they're just following orders, which doesn't that sound familiar, just following orders.

235
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,880
To the best of their ability.

236
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,880
So I don't think that, you know, and probably there's, you know, the same thing that you'd get in a McDonald's.

237
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
And by the way, I'm an asshole at McDonald's.

238
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,880
When I walk up to McDonald's and someone doesn't say, hi, welcome to McDonald's.

239
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
How may I help you?

240
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
I always say, hi, helping to McDonald's.

241
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
How may I help you?

242
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
That's the way your commercial portrays your company.

243
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
I'm not getting any love from you.

244
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,880
And I feel that I'm a dick about that.

245
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
I really am.

246
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Let's go.

247
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
Let's go.

248
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
I say, hi.

249
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Welcome to McDonald's.

250
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
How may I help you?

251
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
You know, if I would get that from the TSA, hi.

252
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Welcome to the TSA.

253
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
We're here for your security.

254
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,880
We're just going to, you know, and sometimes you do get a guy or a gal who's, you know,

255
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,880
shepherding the line and they'll be making jokes and kind of make it fun and funny that happens

256
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
in New York.

257
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
I've had that happen a couple times.

258
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
You know, and that's kind of making light of a quote unquote dire situation.

259
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
But at the end of the day, now, man.

260
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,880
These, these, these people are.

261
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,880
They just don't care.

262
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,880
And I think they, they have as, as little pride in, they would have given you a hamburger

263
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,880
and they can the perfect burger as they would getting you through security securely.

264
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,880
And so of course you're going to have people who just don't like you, you know, because you're not working

265
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
for whatever they're working for.

266
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,880
And of course, you're going to get people who want a little bit of a power trip because they have some.

267
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,880
But, you know, you can't generalize that everyone's evil.

268
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,880
You can generalize that the people who are working there are of a,

269
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,880
a, boy.

270
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Maybe you should just shut up before I get in trouble.

271
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Because by the way, I like going to McDonald's.

272
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
And I have nothing against the people there.

273
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,880
But it just seems like they're in a fucking McDonald's job just, you know,

274
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
getting through and not really caring.

275
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
And that is not the point of security.

276
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Which is exactly what's kind of trying.

277
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
Of course, we won't get any of that.

278
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
And we'll, we'll call you to know TSA.

279
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
If people would be calling, listen to your podcast anyway.

280
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,880
And by the way, if someone from TSA wants to call, I mean, they'd be more than welcome to.

281
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,880
I like, and, and I do get emails from people who just don't want to be on the air because they're

282
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,880
afraid for their own job security, uh, advice.

283
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,880
And I've gotten this from investment bankers, people who understand, you know,

284
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,880
I've been talking a lot about the federal reserve and how, um, how they're just printing money.

285
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,880
And basically, uh, enslaving us in debting us for good.

286
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Uh, but they don't want to come on the air.

287
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
And I can understand.

288
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,880
So I can only kind of pass along what I've learned, uh, in the back room conversations.

289
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,880
Uh, one quick thing, I also want to mention this,

290
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
and this Thanksgiving holiday to this past,

291
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,880
there seem to have been a complete change in the, in the whole travel, uh,

292
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,880
issues and then in America, at least.

293
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,880
And it kind of was revealed that there are flight paths that are designated for commercial

294
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,880
aircrafts and vast majority of the airspace is controlled by the military.

295
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,880
Um, and maybe that's really what's been screwing everything up since September 11.

296
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:46,880
And there's not really been four fluid ounces of stuff that we can't bring on the planes and then TSA people.

297
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Yeah, that's not true.

298
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,880
I can tell you categorically that has nothing to do with it.

299
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Absolutely not.

300
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,880
You know, there's, there's no reason why, you know, if commercial air traffic would be flying

301
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,880
through some supposed military zone, uh, which, by the way, is not necessarily a flight path,

302
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
but it's really, uh, it's a zone.

303
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Um, that, that would, that would have nothing to do with it.

304
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
So I don't, I don't think that change anything.

305
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
I think they just implemented some new systems.

306
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
That's all I think.

307
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
Um, I actually didn't get my checklists.

308
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,880
I guess red pill, my piece smells, my eat theparagus.

309
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Nice.

310
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Oh, sir.

311
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
And, like, oh, no.

312
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
You love you, pick.

313
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Yeah, love you, man.

314
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
No, homo.

315
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Get a lot of those.

316
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
That's pretty funny.

317
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,880
And of course, more, uh, on the TSA and more, uh, Tales of Terror.

318
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Hey, Adam.

319
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Uh, it's my concept.

320
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
Just go.

321
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,880
I, uh, which is going to sit at my nephew is also on this list.

322
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,880
And, um, she does a lot of traveling with his folks.

323
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,880
My sister and my brother-in-law, and she's on the list also.

324
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Um, problem with this is that she is, um, seven years old.

325
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,880
And they constantly want to take him to the back room and, um, my brother-in-law.

326
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
So, you know, I have to go along.

327
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Yeah.

328
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,880
And, um, it's a more lettering thing when they go flying around.

329
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Yeah.

330
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
They travel a lot.

331
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
And what a great station for him.

332
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Yeah, really.

333
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
Travel the world.

334
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,880
But, um, yeah, we're teaching him something now.

335
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
And, um, why they're, um,

336
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,880
He's on the list where, um, he's kind of a shady little guy though.

337
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
Anyway.

338
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,880
And, um, he was looking at the PME well back.

339
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
So the stream pod guys.

340
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Yeah.

341
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Anyway.

342
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
I'm sure you had a good time.

343
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Anyway.

344
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Bye-bye.

345
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Yeah.

346
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
I had a great time.

347
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
The full shizzle.

348
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Yeah.

349
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,880
And again, you know, it's like if a name pops up that, uh, could be an issue.

350
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Nothing wrong with checking it.

351
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
You should be able to take people off the goddamn list.

352
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,880
That's, that's a stupid.

353
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,880
It's irritating.

354
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
It's unnecessary.

355
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,880
And it shows how fucking, what are you using Microsoft Vista?

356
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
What the fuck is that?

357
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Hi, Adam is John Quirk.

358
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Um, just a couple of things.

359
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,880
But maybe relate to your extended interview with US Customs.

360
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Um, it's pretty well known.

361
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,880
I don't think he's any secret that you like the early herb.

362
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Which may not go down well with some people.

363
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,880
We're on drugs and all that.

364
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
And the last thing is at one time on the S.

365
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,880
You did actually say something along the line that I can get any contraband through.

366
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
They won't stop me.

367
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Maybe somebody heard that and decided to put your name on the list.

368
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
And I see what you're carrying.

369
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
That made us be something to do with it.

370
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
I don't know.

371
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Anyway, keep fighting.

372
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
It's the worst fight before.

373
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Yeah.

374
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
All right.

375
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Happy Christmas.

376
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Now, you know what, uh, I don't think so.

377
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,880
And I'm, I'm deriving this or concluding this just from the,

378
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
what's happening in secondary screening.

379
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
They're just interested in me.

380
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
They're not interested.

381
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
They're not really doing a contraband search.

382
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,880
I can tell because I know when people are looking for contraband.

383
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,880
I know what that looks like.

384
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,880
And by the way, you know, that's when they'd bring in dogs and all kinds of stuff.

385
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
And if they really thought I was smuggling contraband,

386
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
I'd have a much more thorough search.

387
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
And of course, I'm not because I'm not stupid.

388
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
I'm not stupid.

389
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Uh, no, I think it's much more likely that someone put me on this list to fuck with me.

390
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Um, and of course, I have some indications as to who that might have been.

391
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Uh, which, of course, is highly legal and just as messed up is if the government themselves had,

392
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,880
you know, had some reason to think that I needed to be screened.

393
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
But again, it doesn't matter.

394
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
It just doesn't matter.

395
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Once I'm cleared and clean, no, once I'm clear, once I'm clear, I should be just fucking clear.

396
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
You know, and I really am going to find out.

397
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
I'm going to, I'm going to ask these guys about this clear card.

398
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,880
If I fill out the clear card, if I give them my retinal scan and fingerprints,

399
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,880
does that mean that I'm cleared through customs?

400
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,880
If not, then you really know it's a bunch of bullshit.

401
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,880
And it's just another version of the National ID card.

402
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,880
It's just another way to register you.

403
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Essentially to fuck with you.

404
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,880
So now, I think, I think the issue is, um, I'm on checkmark somewhere.

405
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
The new systems went into place.

406
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,880
I got the new passport with the RFID chip.

407
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,880
So now they can actually scan me in the new system and Bing.

408
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Shit's popping up.

409
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
What was it?

410
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Did I see a fantastic story the other day?

411
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Oh, please tell me.

412
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
I put that in my Google notebook.

413
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,880
A girl from Iceland, I believe.

414
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
She went through a horrible ordeal.

415
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,880
I'm just recalling this from memory.

416
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,880
She and her girlfriends went to New York to have some fun for a couple days.

417
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Do some shopping and hang out.

418
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
And she was stopped at customs.

419
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,880
And they said, oh, at the border, basically.

420
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,880
And they said, well, you overstayed your tourist visa in 1995.

421
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
And we're going to deport you.

422
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
And she said, well, wait a minute.

423
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,880
You know, I've been to the States a couple times since 1995.

424
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
And no one ever mentioned anything.

425
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
And so, you know, what's the problem?

426
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,880
She was detained for two days, put in shackles, subjected to all kinds of searches.

427
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Couldn't make an international call to anyone.

428
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
You know, just really fucking lame.

429
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
I'll put a link in the show notes of that web blog.

430
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,880
I mean, that's, um, uh, bummed I can't find it now.

431
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,880
I can't, I'm, I was sure I would have, almost second.

432
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,880
I'm sure that I would have booked Mark that or put that into my, uh, put that into my notebook.

433
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,880
It was essentially, it's a translation of a blog post that she wrote.

434
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
And she's hot, too.

435
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
I wonder if that has anything to do with it.

436
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
She's blonde.

437
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Maybe it's just against blonde, huh?

438
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Hold on.

439
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Let me just see if I can find it.

440
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Hmm.

441
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
No.

442
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
Oh, thanks.

443
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
No.

444
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,880
All right.

445
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
I'll look for it.

446
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,880
I will put a link in the show notes of daily source code.com.

447
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Hey, here's a sabanta who has, has a very good solution for me getting into the United States.

448
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,880
Hey, here.

449
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Hello, Adam.

450
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
Here's some fairies.

451
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Hey, buddy.

452
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
Long time, etc.

453
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
Yeah, yeah.

454
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Um, certainly sympathize with you about the issues with the US immigration.

455
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
I've had my moments there.

456
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
But nothing is severe as you're getting.

457
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,880
And it's particularly calling since you are a citizen.

458
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
And I am not.

459
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Still, I can understand the problem.

460
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
I know where the problem lies.

461
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,880
And I know what the answer is.

462
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Yeah, you need longer sleeves.

463
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,880
Because each time you reach out to become a finger on those in scanner,

464
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,880
the man behind the desk sees that your watch is worth more than his house.

465
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,880
He's all in, that's all it is.

466
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
No, no.

467
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
Anyway, um, I, of course,

468
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
the public detestations for you.

469
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
Yes.

470
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
This is a potential exotable way.

471
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Yes, I've got it.

472
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Yes, no.

473
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
Thank you.

474
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Thank you, Hugh.

475
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
No, man.

476
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
You've got it all wrong.

477
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
Americans are not like that.

478
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
Americans see that you're successful.

479
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,880
The only thing in American citizen will think is,

480
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
damn, I want to be that successful.

481
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Congratulations, dude.

482
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
I'm glad you made it.

483
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
That's what the American citizen thinks.

484
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
Seriously, it's part of the dream.

485
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
It's what we all work towards.

486
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,880
And of course, it's, you know, it's very materialistic.

487
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
But it's, uh, it's just the way it is.

488
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
No, I don't think so.

489
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
And by the way, um, you know, the TSA,

490
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
and I was equating them to McDonald's workers,

491
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,880
and they should, uh, they should have the, you know,

492
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,880
nice, happy attitude.

493
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,880
I really do miss what you used to get, uh,

494
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
years ago when you'd come into the United States,

495
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,880
they would, the customs and border patrol.

496
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
They would say, welcome home.

497
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
They would say, hi, how you doing?

498
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
Welcome home.

499
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
And you know what, even if they said,

500
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
now, hey, welcome home.

501
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,880
Uh, we just got to check in a few things.

502
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
It's, uh, it's for everyone's security.

503
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
Just come on back, you know.

504
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Ah, fuck it.

505
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,880
I can't, uh, I'm not even angry anymore, barred.

506
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
I'm just not.

507
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
I thought you were based in LA.

508
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Oh, like, are they?

509
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,880
Yeah.

510
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
LA is, oh, I'm up.

511
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
So I'm, so I'm just going to go out now.

512
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,880
Oh, they gay.

513
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,880
I'm going to think.

514
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,880
God.

515
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
I bite the hand of feet.

516
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Haha.

517
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
It may be a limp hand if we don't know.

518
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,880
If they win, if they win, LA, I'm going to go to their offices.

519
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,880
And I'm, I'm going to have a few strong words.

520
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
It's Adam in.

521
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
Yeah.

522
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Oh, he's curry.

523
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
Over here.

524
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
You want it.

525
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Haha.

526
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
That'd be quite a laugh, actually.

527
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,880
Just strolling and pick pair of scissors.

528
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
No, right, they can curry.

529
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Let's sort that fucking barnet out, shall we?

530
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,880
Haha.

531
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
It didn't work for John Bongeau, because whoever him.

532
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
Well, it didn't work for John Bongeau.

533
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,880
What, bonnet?

534
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
The hair.

535
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
It didn't work for John Bongeau.

536
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
I didn't think he was a pink.

537
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,880
She was a superstar and all the ladies loved his hair.

538
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,880
Wow.

539
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Well, Adam Curry, that worked.

540
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
Just looks like a girl.

541
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Haha.

542
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Oh, he's, they're sending this.

543
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,880
See if he fucking pays this out on Daily Source part.

544
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,880
Haha.

545
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Ah.

546
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
Now who were these guys?

547
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Ah, damn.

548
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Let me see.

549
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
LA is somewhat, some, some, some, some, some, some.

550
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
I bet you they have no hair.

551
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
That's what I usually find.

552
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:42,160
people who make haired jokes have very little hair themselves. Sorry, boys. Anyway, nice to hear

553
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,200
the Brits kicking in. You got a lot of British phone calls this time around. That's good. You guys

554
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,760
are back home. You're getting ready for the holidays. You've quit working. You've got time to chill out

555
00:24:51,760 --> 00:25:00,720
to listen and buy stuff. Hey, Adam Mike here from the southernmost reaches of Canada. Listen to

556
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:08,400
show 701. And you had asked listeners if they had picked up any new Sony headphones. And I have.

557
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,040
And I love them. However, they're not the headphones that I was actually looking for. I was looking

558
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:21,040
for the sleek metal housing noise canceling. What's this? Show up on the page when you punch in the

559
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,440
URL that you gave the ear listeners. Sony dot com slash headphones. Those aren't available until

560
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,920
actually today. But I bought my headphones last week. You couldn't wait. And they actually replaced

561
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:42,560
a set of fast text T50s that I had bought in the 80s and all the black stuff that holds a

562
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,080
phone. And that's all coming out. Yeah. And the cable shows some intermittent noise. So I wanted

563
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,240
to replace those. So I said, well, I'll just get some nice Sony studio installed kind of headphones.

564
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,560
And I have to tell you these units are so light and they sound very good. Awesome. The other thing

565
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:06,480
is you were in New York. And I also listened to, I love the company with David Epilito. And there

566
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,680
was a time there. Right when he went from five shows a week down to, you know, a shortened schedule,

567
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:18,960
I guess you'd say. And he sounded somewhat disgruntled. I'd have to say about, about Podio. Without

568
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,560
actually saying anything nasty about Podio, he compared doing the podcasting and a monetary

569
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:31,280
sense to having a paper route. That's how much money he felt. Like I feel like he's putting a lot

570
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,240
of work into it. And, you know, he wants to see some returns or something. I'm not sure. And he's

571
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,920
not sure either. So he really wants to talk to you. It sounds like he says, well, if Adam's ever

572
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,920
in town, I'd really like to go have a cup of coffee with him or something. And it's too bad that

573
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,960
he were there. And you guys didn't hook up again. But anyway, that's it. I've been rambling on too

574
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:59,440
long already. And I love you, Adam Kirk. Oh, I love you, too. No, home. Yeah. So first of all, thanks for the

575
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,440
thanks for the feedback on the Sony headphones. We got a couple pairs here. I like him very much.

576
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,680
I've been using Sony's for a long time. Before that, I was pioneers. No way. I think first

577
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:17,520
it was the it was actually Dave Clark conversion. So the helicopter headsets converted to

578
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,200
to real audio headsets. Those are the because they really were tight. And you couldn't get any

579
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,360
feedback from the headphones to the microphone because I like turning up the cans really loud. And

580
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:32,080
then it was the pioneers. Kind of those those black half coconut shells. And from then on in,

581
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:39,360
I think when Sony came out with their kind of collapsible soft foam yet completely closed and

582
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,800
I don't think I ever look back. Really, really like him. Regarding David I believe, of course,

583
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,440
that guitar man from Central Park, I'm a big fan of his music, I'm a big fan of what he's doing in

584
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:56,320
Central Park, I'm a big fan of his show. Unfortunately, you know, the only way you're going to make

585
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:03,440
money is by having an audience that is big enough if you're in the advertising game. And I'm not

586
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:12,000
kind of discuss David's audience size, but he knows what's looking delivering to an audience

587
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,440
size of a paper out. So it's like there's no magic bullet here. There really isn't. He needs to go

588
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,520
on a campaign. You know, he needs to get people listening. His listeners need to get people listening.

589
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,560
That's what you guys do for the show. And he's got to find his niche and maybe his niche is just

590
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,880
really small. However, I have to say that in 2008, Pod Show is going to have a number of other ways

591
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,600
for people to make money with their own shows. I'm really excited about it. We're calling it seller

592
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,240
Tainman. And it's very much the go-daddy system. You have to know that whenever someone

593
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:54,000
uses a domain name promo code or a coupon or whatever it's called, the show and question who's

594
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,600
who's co-use, you know, they get a hit. They get a bonus. If you're a new customer, they get

595
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:08,480
you know, a substantial dineros. And just think about why, you know, every company that's really good

596
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,120
and has a product or service. You know, they know what their customer acquisition is. They know what

597
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:20,800
it costs to get a customer to join the program by their product. And if they're a company that

598
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,160
you know, that has follow on products as most do, they know what the lifetime value of that

599
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,720
customer will be. They know how much money they can get out of that customer in the life

600
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,320
lifetime of that customer being a customer. So it's what they call customer lifetime customer value.

601
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,200
And it's a real simple equation for them. So let's say that they can get three to $400 out of

602
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,520
someone. They're pretty happy to give up 20 bucks. You know, here's $20. Thank you for the customer.

603
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,440
And I believe, or I think we've proven time and time again that it's very, very effective

604
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,880
to talk about products and stuff that you like on your show because if you don't, you're not going

605
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,680
to sell that anyway. And you'll see that your audience will buy into that. So if you have only,

606
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,840
let's say you only have a thousand listeners. You know, that's basically in the advertising business.

607
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:13,520
That's one CPM. That's one million, one meal. So 1,000 people. And the going rate is anywhere

608
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,920
from $10 to $35. So, you know, if you have a show and a thousand people listen to an episode,

609
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,480
you know, if we filled up the inventory there, we could get you, you know, at minimum 10 bucks.

610
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,880
However, if you, if you sold a number of domain names or how about a Nokia N810,

611
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,040
you might be getting substantially more. And I mentioned the Nokia N810 specifically

612
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,120
because I believe the codes are now finally being made. I have a feeling that we, we probably

613
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,440
are not going to hit it before Christmas and I apologize and everyone apologize. Finland,

614
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,480
fucking apologizes. San Francisco apologizes. We, you know, just, there's a number of reasons

615
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,440
while you just couldn't get it together. Quickly enough. Funny enough for the U.S. promo codes,

616
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,280
I think we're taking the longest for some reason. And as you know, a big fan of this device,

617
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,880
it's made in Finland. I might want to point out. As far as I know, actually, all the parts

618
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,320
are made in Finland. That would be interesting to find out. Find country, part of the European

619
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Union. And, you know, it's a great company. They started making rubber boots and paper products.

620
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,480
And they've, they're a manufacturing company. And a damn good one. And they make good shit.

621
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,160
And I like it. And I love this device. And hopefully I'll be able to get it to you at a good

622
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:37,440
price very soon. Um, okay. So now I'm segue, segue from segue, segue, segue. segueing from that

623
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,960
into, uh, into this whole, uh, wow, study I've been making really about, you know, what makes

624
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,200
the U.S. economy take, what makes it turn, what makes it churn. Um, seeing is that we're completely

625
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,400
being ripped off by companies who are in Kahootz with, uh, I would say the parts of Congress and

626
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:05,520
certainly the federal reserve and the world bank, um, who, you know, essentially had been, you know,

627
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,680
if it's all, it's so hard. You really should read this book. Of course, I'll put a link in show

628
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:17,360
notes to, uh, to the confessions of an economic hitman. Um, essentially the way, you know,

629
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,160
the way it's worked in the past is, hey, um, leader of a foreign country, uh, either in the Middle

630
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:28,080
East or perhaps South America. Um, guess what, uh, we're going to come in here. Uh, we're going to,

631
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:35,200
uh, you're going to borrow, uh, $100 billion from the U.S. And this $100 billion is going to

632
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,440
get you infrastructure. We're going to build power plants and and refineries and all kinds of, uh,

633
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,800
power related industry is going to come in and we're, uh, here's the economic models and here's

634
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,000
how that's going to boost up the economy and make your country fantastic. Uh, the world bank will

635
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,920
lend you this money at a very favorable rate. Of course, there's no way in hell, they'll ever be able

636
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,560
to pay it back, which is part of the trap. Oh, and here's $200 million for you and your family

637
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,440
in this black bag. Of course, if you don't want the deal, then I can always send it to jackals,

638
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,120
meaning the CIA, essentially, and you know, they'll probably kill you if you don't participate

639
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,800
in our little program. And so that's what's been happening in all of these countries.

640
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,920
And the way to slow that down, the way to say, hey, hold on a second,

641
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,160
when it's not going to take this anymore, because you know, these these big companies that

642
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,680
be companies. And if you listen to this story from this John Perkins guy, you know, he didn't even

643
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,560
realize what he was doing until, won't tell essentially it was too late and he had to get out

644
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,800
while he still could get out. Because he was just getting richer and everything was great and

645
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,280
fine, and then he kind of woke up to the reality and saw what was really happening and he stopped.

646
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,640
And we can do the same thing. And you know what? It's not going to take a lot. I've been doing

647
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,400
more research. First of all, I'm going to play this little bit from the New York Times front page,

648
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:01,920
which is a it's a podcast where James Baron usually reads the front page, the highlights from

649
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,080
the front page of the New York Times, which is a great show because, you know, gives me the highlights

650
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,240
of the day. And it also tells me if I want to go look at New York Times dot com or if I even want

651
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,000
to pick up a copy of the paper, there could be a reason for that as well. So I think it's a fantastic

652
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:24,000
content. And it's the New York F in times. So I'm going to play this bit from a couple of days ago

653
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,040
and it's basically a financial report and listen to what they're talking about, what the story

654
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,240
is about, it's about consumers, about our shopping habits, about our buying and who it affects

655
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,280
and then listen to the percentages. Okay, let's just play this little bit from the New York Times front

656
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,440
page podcast. Hey, Adam Mike here from the, what a great set of. Let's try that again.

657
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:56,080
Inside Fridays times a dilemma for the federal reserve. Retail sales rose 1.2% in November.

658
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,000
That plus a jump in wholesale prices and a decline in new unemployment claims pointed to resilience in

659
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,720
the economy even as the financial system and the housing market continued to weaken. But the new

660
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,160
data conflict with other reports and that's the problem facing the Fed. Investment strategist James

661
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,840
Swanson of the mutual fund company, MFS investment says we'll model through. He says there's not

662
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:23,440
going to be an all clear or a big collapse. All right, did you listen to that? Did you hear?

663
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,400
So they're talking about retail and wholesale prices. Basically about what's being spent? What are

664
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,800
we buying? How much are we buying? So let's just, let's just pick through this for a second.

665
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,800
Here we go. Inside Fridays times a dilemma for the federal reserve. Okay, first of all, a dilemma

666
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,920
for the federal reserve. Remember, the federal reserve is as governmental as federal express. It is a

667
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:55,680
private commercial company who has the exclusive right to print US dollars. They print money when

668
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,720
they feel it is necessary. Therefore, they control the supply and demand of dollars,

669
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,800
which means they control inflation. They control interest rates that banks can borrow and of course

670
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,040
foreign countries as well and of course that all eventually trickles down to how much your mortgage

671
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:19,600
rate is. So these are the guys who really control a lot and the consumer purchasing habits are

672
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:27,920
causing them a headache. So this is good news. We know how to cause headaches for these guys,

673
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,080
which gets attention. Let's listen to what the headache is. Retail sales rose 1.2% in November.

674
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,840
That plus a jump in wholesale prices and a decline in new unemployment claims pointed to resilience

675
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,640
in the economy even as the financial system in the housing market continue to weaken. Okay,

676
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,480
so this is very interesting. 1.2%. So in essence, by all of us,

677
00:36:52,560 --> 00:37:02,560
purchasing 1.2% more than usual, we made the federal reserve happy. 1% just one little percent,

678
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,400
a little bit more. That made them very happy, meaning the engine is still working. It's still firing.

679
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,000
Maybe not on all cylinders, but it's still working. We're still spending. Now, I believe

680
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,920
and it's even hard for me to understand this next bit. I believe that the concern for the federal

681
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,120
reserve is that they think this money is coming. Well, let's listen to it again. You can,

682
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,160
but the new data conflict with other reports and that's the problem facing the Fed. Investment

683
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,320
strategist James Swanson of the mutual fund company, MFS investment says we'll model through. He says

684
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:42,800
there's not going to be an all-clear or a big collapse. Okay, so what that basically means is yes,

685
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,680
consumers have spent more, 1.2%, very happy, but no, all the other data about the mortgage rate,

686
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,400
the prime, the structured investment vehicles, the subprime loans, that, you know, I think Morgan

687
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,960
Stanley now announced another five or six billion dollars they're writing off. That doesn't

688
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,800
seem to be over yet. In fact, I think it's far from over. I think the problems are going to be

689
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,640
much deeper with that. So the Fed is worried about that. So let's just forget the second half

690
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,920
and concentrate on the first half. If all we have to do to make the Fed happy is spend 1% more,

691
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,520
we can probably really get their attention and piss them off by spending a couple percent less.

692
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:33,360
So think about it. It wouldn't even take that much. Let's just forget all the types of products

693
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,760
and services that we buy for a second. Forget where they're made. That's a whole other issue.

694
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,840
But just to get the attention, the Federal Reserve, if all we always have to do is spend 5% less.

695
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:50,880
5%, what is 5% of every hundred dollars you spend that you know how fast that goes.

696
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,360
Keep five bucks in your pocket. Don't spend it. Save it. Put it under your mattress.

697
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,640
Do something else with it. But don't buy stuff. If we all did that,

698
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,800
we all did that very simple act of saving 5%. Can you imagine what the, I mean, it would be

699
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,520
consumer spending down 5% Fed freaking out. And we could say, hey, just want to show you the

700
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,120
power now. We've got some demands we want to make. At this next comment has another great idea.

701
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:31,200
I really like this. Hey Adam, the vermilion support Pennsylvania. Listen to you talk about sending

702
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,480
a message and listen to show. I think 700 tried calling in about not buying fuel.

703
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,720
And they just make an important other day or whatever. Why don't we all just want to fill up

704
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:52,240
fill up with six dollars in 60 cents to the bunch of six sixes flying on. You got to get

705
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,080
some media recognition. I would thank you. Yeah. I love you Adam.

706
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,360
I love you too. And I think this is, yo, I think it's a great idea. I don't know about six

707
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,040
dollars and 66 cents. I think it would be more like 66 dollars and 66 cents. But yeah,

708
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,120
right on. Let's do that. I'm going to start immediately. I'm going to try and round off everything to

709
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:24,640
six six six. The mark of the beast. Great idea. Yes, if you fill up fill up $6 and 66 cents

710
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:33,200
or $66 and 66 cents. That's really cool. So essentially, yeah, we should do maybe we should drop

711
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:40,480
consumer spending by six point 66 percent. Be nice if we could do it. So just spend six

712
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,520
percent less, six and a half percent less, and then maybe if we're really good, if we really

713
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,640
work on it, we can get that report on the New York Times to say consumer spending drop by six

714
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:59,760
point six six percent coincidence, you'll have to read the book. And lots of people sending me info

715
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:07,840
about Reverend Billy. This is the movie, what would Jesus buy for Christmas? And I didn't realize

716
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:14,800
that this Reverend Billy is actually is a real guy. And this is more a documentary than a film.

717
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,160
It's kind of a combination where it gets thrown out of the Mall of America and thrown out of Disneyland.

718
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:28,960
Got to be bad to be thrown out of Disneyland. And the guy is an actor. And obviously it's a protest

719
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,440
of sorts. And I'm really starting to like it. And I thought it was, you know, I thought just thought

720
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,480
it was a movie period, but it's a little, it goes a little bit deeper than that. So the concept of

721
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:46,000
Reverend Billy is a shop, a stop the shocker, was he called shop, a shop, a shop, can't say it.

722
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:55,040
Shop, a colism. Stop the addiction to shopping, essentially. Stop the corp, the corp talk.

723
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,320
So he has a similar message. And if you combine the two, if you say, let's stop shopping and show

724
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:07,280
them the mark of the beast by spending six point 66 percent less. I think we could have a real

725
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,040
good brotherhood here between the two of us. And on the site, there's a great song about stopping

726
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,640
shopping with Reverend Billy's choir that I just wanted to share with you.

727
00:42:43,040 --> 00:43:13,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

728
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:43,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Lord I love the little we already got a love love yeah, yeah

Back on the way from the front.

00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Back on the forward.

748
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Time the power.

749
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Time the power.

Stop.

754
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
The Reverend Billy and his choir stop shopping.

755
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You can find them at RevBilly.com.

756
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That will work the look.

757
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Mainstream media is paying attention to this guy.

758
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
So I like that a lot.

759
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
All right.

760
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
One more comment.

761
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Do two more comments.

762
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And one more Christmas song to play us out for the day.

763
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Hi.

764
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I'm sorry for making you play.

765
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm the not-so-referent county of Essex.

766
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I don't know.

767
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I think this is your podcast for a few months.

768
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Why?

769
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Call in and say hello.

770
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You show really gets me from the day-art work.

771
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So I keep doing it.

772
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Take this really cool.

773
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
What you doing on this long haul dude, as well.

774
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And he's campaign.

775
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And you're absolutely right.

776
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
No one over here.

777
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
No two of the hell he is.

778
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And it was cool.

779
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Did you use it with his little ideas.

780
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That was good.

781
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
You should do more stuff like that.

782
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That was really cool.

783
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Anyway, just saying hello.

784
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So good luck with the show and Adi OS.

785
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
All right, man.

786
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Thank you very much for listening.

787
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,560
family. Hey Adam, it's Mike from the UC radio pod show, which you can find 24 seven and

788
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:14,320
bite me FCC dot com plug. You know, I was listening to the DSC 700 the other day and you were

789
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,840
talking about the TSA and all the trouble you're going through and you know what, I feel your

790
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,800
pain. I lived down in Belize for seven years in the 90s and about a year into that I got

791
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,520
caught bringing Cuban cigars back into the country. They made me stand there and break them all in

792
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,880
front of them and then throw them right into a shredder, which just fucking nice me to do. But

793
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,080
I dealt with that. I figured out it for the next five years. Every time I came back to the

794
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:43,360
States, which was about once a month for business, I was basically strip searched. They went through

795
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:50,160
all my shit destroyed my bags. It just sucked. So I do feel your pain. But your suggestion, I went ahead

796
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,960
and bought you a domain and unfortunately I didn't use your promo code. I used my own UC radio three

797
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:01,760
but right to go daddy and I got you don't send Adam to getmo dot com. So now the domain don't send

798
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:07,360
Adam to getmo dot com points right to your site. So that's it. You have a good holiday. I'll talk to

799
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:13,360
you soon and what am I supposed to say here? I think it's I fucking love you. Yeah, because I'm confused.

800
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:20,320
All right. Thanks Mike. Of course you really wanted to use DSC3 to get that domain name for

801
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:25,600
695. Let me see. Don't send Adam to getmo dot com. Thanks man. That's pretty cool. Let's see where

802
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:40,800
it points to. Okay. It doesn't say. You've got to look at this. Very funny. It actually before,

803
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:50,960
nice. Before it, before it sends you to curry dot com, it sends you to another domain which is

804
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:57,360
called Adam Curry is a fucking homo dot com which has a roof. I can't really see it long enough

805
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:02,240
because then it it forwards to curry dot com. Thanks Mike. Nice man. You know what? What uh,

806
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,880
how many guys do they have to have to feel you up when that when you're going through that?

807
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:14,080
Mike's a really big guy. You know and did they, did they lose any any bracelets or or watches

808
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:19,280
while they were at it my friend? I'll play this one for you Mike. I really appreciate the love my

809
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:25,840
brother. Nice little piece. Forget about the true meaning of Christmas. Get us in the mood.

810
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,880
Love, friendship and spending time with the family. Mama would be inside,

811
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,880
fix and turkey and dressing and me and my brothers used to play outside and snow for hours. Throw

812
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,480
and snow balls and I'll never forget my daddy coming outside and saying, hey,

813
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,880
I hope that they're going to snowman. I think I risked the fire on the lane.

814
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,720
You could have used the ball, but I keep going. Marara's zucchini.

815
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:04,720
But the stadium used a symbol. Something you did barely say. I hope that they're going to snowman

816
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,520
and maybe they may look like me. You boys been talking to your mama. I got your Christmas
