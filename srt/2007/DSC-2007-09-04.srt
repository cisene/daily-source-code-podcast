00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey, this is Michael Butler from the Rock and Roll Geek Show.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Check out one of my favorite TV shows this summer,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Bow Dog Music Battle of the Band.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's a competition with Johnny Rotten as one of the judges,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and that is quality television, my friends.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's Adam here from the Curry Condo in San Francisco.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
No cow.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's going to be a short show today.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is episode number six, five,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
nineer of the Daily Source Code.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And it's going to be a short show because,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
well, this morning I went to the office right in early,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
really energized and completely ready to just dive headfirst

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
into the thick of things, and it was a real good vibe around the office,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and it was really nice people were congratulating me on my birthday.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I got a nice gift from the company and some flowers.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Went out to lunch with Ron,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and I got a text message from Christina.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And what that message said really took the wind out of me,

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
quite honestly, which is, well, right now it's,

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
what is it, it's seven, 15 and the evening on Tuesday,

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and you know, so I finished out the day and came back home

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and just figured just about the only thing I could do,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
we've been through so much together on this show,

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
if you think about it,

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
it's shared with you because that's,

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
it's a way for me to get it off my chest.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
One of our cats, Cindy,

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and you've seen pictures of them on,

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and it's Cindy with an S, by the way,

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
for Sinbad, I guess, or whatever, but Cindy is his name.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I was hit by a car and killed this evening.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And for those of you who have pets,

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you know, we've had Cindy with us for 14 years,

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
13 or 14 years.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I actually found him in New Jersey,

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
in a bath, in a gas station, men's room.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In a box, he was maybe two or three weeks old,

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
completely infected eye,

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and he was really being eaten up by infection,

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
you know, pretty much close to death, and of course,

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
way too young to be without a mom.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And we took him in,

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and Patricia and I and Christina,

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
who was very young at the time.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We basically nursed him to health,

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and he became just an incredible animal,

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and a real friend,

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and just so strong,

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and he's been through so many different moves with us,

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you know, from America to Amsterdam,

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
he's lived in so many crazy,

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and in a way, dangerous places,

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and I guess this was just

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
a wrong time, wrong place.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And of course,

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
you know, really distressing for Christina and for Patricia,

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and I hate it.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I really can't tell you how

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
emotional I am that I'm not there.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And, you know,

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
it's all these little things you think about,

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and this is like a kid, man.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's like part of our family.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And, you know,

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
so animals, particularly after many years,

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you know, you start to,

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I guess when the no longer there is when you really think about it,

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
but you start to notice that they do all kinds of fun things,

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you know,

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and Cindy loved to drink water out of the tap.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You always hop up on Patricia's sink in evening,

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and you have to turn the water on,

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
just the right stream,

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
so that he can stick his head under there,

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and drink from it.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
God knows why.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You know,

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
if Christina was upstairs with a boyfriend,

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
he would always sit right in between the middle of them,

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
you know, kind of keeping out of watchful eye,

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
it really is just just a really great,

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
great cat,

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
great pet,

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
great,

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
we have friend really.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And that's,

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and that's really the thing with all animals,

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
you know,

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
all they want to really do is,

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
you know,

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
just feed them,

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
please,

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and they just want to be your buddy.

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They just want to,

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
you know,

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
love it,

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and it's all very simple,

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and honest,

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and you know,

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
that's something that you can always count on from a pet.

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So,

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I really, really miss him.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is,

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and I'm going to miss him.

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And,

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I really just sucks.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So,

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm going to play a song for Cindy,

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and for all of us to share

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
in his memory.

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank you for being a friend.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Traveled down a road

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and back again,

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
your heart is true,

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
you're a pal,

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and a confidence.

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm not ashamed to say,

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I hope it always will stay this way.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
My heart is all full,

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
just stand up and take a bow.

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And if you're through a party,

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
invite it everyone,

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
you know,

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
we,

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
you won't see the biggest difference between me,

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and the card attached,

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
we'll say,

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
thank you for being a friend.

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000

Thank you for being a friend.

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If it's a car you lack,

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I truly buy you a car lack,

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
whatever you need,

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and a time of the day and night.

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm not ashamed to say,

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I hope it always will stay this way.

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
My heart is all full,

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
just stand up and take a bow.

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And if you're through a party,

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
you know,

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
we won't see the biggest difference between me,

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and the card attached,

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000

Let me tell you about it.

171
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I want to thank you.

in tonight.

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:52,000
From the beginning you will be gone, as we are, I'm so so sad, that once again, thank you for being here.

181
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I want to thank you, thank you for being here, I want to thank you, thank you for being here, I want to thank you, thank you for being here, I want to thank you.
