Delta, here it is, episode five, five, nine, or maybe source code with Adam Curry.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,040
It's my art.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,280
Being able to choose the music that I want to play for you is virtually your bomb.

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,280
It's musical for my work plan.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,280
I love the cowbell on it.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
Oh, that was so cheap.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
It's sweaty.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,280
You really want to lift that leg and squeeze the butt.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
Good.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
Now it's geeky goodness.

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,440
I mean, just start this thing up on a command line and then lock that puppy down.

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,240
No, that's about all that's needed to load.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,040
You're supposed to be my trophy wife and I can just see it now.

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
I got this.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,760
And it's all for you.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,520
It's my job to entertain you.

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,080
In fact, I mean, it's going to jail.

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
So be it.

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,400
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Turned me to see this.

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,120
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,000
We don't need not sticking greens, man.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,400
I like to think I'm flying.

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,000
Just join me.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,680
I'm testing his out of curry.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
She's right, and all this black and white at killing time

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
She's a tree, I like her dress, and I like it on her own

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But there's no way to believe him, but she says

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Because her eyes are misled

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't know her, like I thought I'd get

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A long time ago, she used to look wrong

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That whatever it was all

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Sweet December, not in the inside

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't know where they went, or if it meant

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But everyone's gonna dance with the feeling inside

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She's a tree, I like her dress, and I like it on her own

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But there's no way to believe him, but she says

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Because her eyes are misled

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't love her, maybe I'm a friend

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But if I don't treat you right, all through night

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
As long as you stay quiet, at killing time

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know what the weather's like where you are, but

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This fits so perfectly with the weather surrounding the curry

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Manor, the vinyl strangers and patriotic girl

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Kicking off Delta Sierra Charlie 5-5-9er

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's a nice song, it's a happy song

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
From Georgia, and I guess they're touring around the Deep South

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Getting ready to follow up, of course

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They're music is available on the Podsave Music Network

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Links in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hey everybody, how you doing? It's Thursday

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Got the end of the week, it's creeping up on us

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So two football Friday, which we'll be celebrating today

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
From tomorrow, I'm sorry, from the manner

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Because I think I told you, yes, I've delayed my departure

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
On Friday, so that we can party down together

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You know?

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes, it was so busy, of course, I had that delay

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Because of the lady Patricia's massive loss of blood

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Through her nasal passages

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It was up until like 12 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
12 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 30 o'clock, still on the phone

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Using the VoIP, of course, the Gizmo project

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Man, I'm really liking this thing

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm really not liking my ISP though

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The DSL that I'm getting into the cottage is just shit

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You know, I'll get a single, a single connection

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We'll probably do about

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hmm, from one server, so let's say I'm bringing in music

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
From the positive music network as an example

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So I'm downloading the tracks for the show

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's, I don't know, about 35 kilobytes

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
About 350 kilobits per second, give or take

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And that's slow, you know, I'm supposed to have four megs

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah, right

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Maybe I should try one of those speed sites

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That actually test the speed of my link

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Anyway, so I can open up two of those streams

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And both of them will come in at about

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Three, four hundred kilobits per second

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
About half a meg, a little less than half a meg

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So if I can do both of them the same time

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's telling me that somewhere there's some kind of

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Throttling going on, it's not a very nice experience

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But then again, we don't have that nice dedicated line anymore

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's just a old fashioned consumer setup

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So as I said, it's beautiful today

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The lady's out, lady Patricia's outside

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Of course, why should she sit in the studio and do a show?

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why?

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I mean, why?

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why?

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Gracie with her, you know, you should send her email

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You really should

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Patricia at curie.com, tell her she had needs to come on the show

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's just like I can't coordinate it with her

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And she has other things to do

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You know, she doesn't listen, you know, there's a whole part of my life

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The ones that we share together that she knows

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I think about is a little bit of the concerning I have to say

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Especially when you know what I'm doing with Amy Max

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hey, baby, it's Thursday, it's time

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Get that ass and shake, and I should firm, take me up

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Amy

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Happy Thursday, Adam

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hey, baby, how you doing?

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And hello to Patricia, she's there with you

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
She's outside, I just sitting in the sun

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Go ahead and switch your mic, we're doing an old school move today

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay, hold on

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I got to move it up, it's moved actually

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Reminds me of basketball practice

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay, get ready

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I know, take a moment to picture me trying to play basketball

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Boy, boy, boy, boy

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Anyway, you always talk about your fencing background

122
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So I thought today we'd put it to the task

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay, I'm ready, what do we do?

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're going to start standing tall with arms above your head

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay, arms above your head

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Now you're going to squat down to the floor and place your hands on the floor

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay, now

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Now you're going to shoot those legs out to a push-up position

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And then we're going to go back to the squat

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And jump up and lift your arms toward the ceiling

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Excellent, seven more

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Squeeze that butt through the whole thing

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Breathe

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I love it when you tell me to breathe

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Extend those legs out all the way

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I just hit my head on the ceiling

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Is that all the higher you can jump?

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I can't jump higher, I go to the fucking roof

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Are you breathing?

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Great job

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ow

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And by the way, thanks for the ass compliment

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I really do appreciate it

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We are working on a plan for ass-ercise video

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Although I'm not sure when we can get it out

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
After all, Chris and I are just a two-man team

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You will be the first to know when it's done

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Until then, you're going to have to get your move of the week video from FitLife

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Have a great weekend

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Have a great weekend

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Have a great weekend

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Did your wife just ask us to double-team her?

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I didn't understand exactly what she was saying

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Does she need help?

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It does get the blood pumping

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I couldn't jump so high because the attic only has

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I mean, I can't jump high in any house

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Actually

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No, correction

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
At the curry castle, I could jump as high as I want

163
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Of course, we could also ride the segway

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And doors in the curry castle

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I gotta fire that thing up again

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's just sitting in the garage

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
With empty battery and flat tires

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The tires are just deflated

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So they're not actually punctured

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I should get that rolling again

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That thing was so much fun

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
There you go

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let me see

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Quick chat about the name for the N800

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It seems like we have a real conversation

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's going here

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Tariya, I think, is still the best name so far

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Tariya is a finished name

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So, you know, being a finished product, et cetera

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And Tariya also being the first name of the president of Finland

181
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Makes sense, right?

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Well, let me see

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Rick Denhan

184
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Says Adam, with all the ports open

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Remember, this is what we're doing

186
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We're opening up this N800 Linux-based device

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So the developers coming can come in

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Violate the ports

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And a violator file system

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Through or wide open ports, I guess, as the way I should say it

191
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Excuse me

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why don't you try out some nice folders

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You know, the folders, they got these new gourmet blends

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And for XR points, combine it with some Splenda

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Flavor brand

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Stuff

197
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Rick Denhan, Adam, with all the ports open

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Developers having full access being able to do whatever they want

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You won't have any idea what's going on in there

200
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And I will you

201
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So why not call it Pandora

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You'll never know what's coming out of Pandora's box

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Someone else sent in a suggestion

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That since Trinity is also a name from the Matrix

205
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That we call the N800 Neo

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It makes a lot of sense

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's way too cyber geeky for me

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And Tom Scooting, official biographer of all things curry

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Said maybe it's not a good idea to name a Sharon Stone

210
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He sent this picture, I got to post this link at the show notes

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The Sharon Stone, oh my god

212
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
No, if that's what Sharon Stone looks like these days

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't think we want that analogy carrying over

214
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
To be kind of a bit freaky

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And we're doing all this, of course, for the free Trinity ride

216
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
As my 1984 Baby Poo colored Mercedes station wagon

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Running on biodiesel

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Tracks across America

219
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And we want to have some technology to track her

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And for her to send stuff back

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
In the form of GPS positions

222
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Periodic picture

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Maybe some video, but certainly just some data

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So we can follow the track as she goes from the west coast to the east coast

225
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And far, far beyond

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay, we focus your ears

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Ready for Roger Smalls

228
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Remember he talks in a very high voice

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And it's an English accent, so it'll take a few minutes to adjust here we go

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hello, I said Russian here

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He mentioned everyone he tries Trinity across the world

232
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He's going to have a problem when they can't get her

233
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And after that finish

234
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Why then you buy a second biodiesel car

235
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Skiff paperless back

236
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
After that finish driving that stretch of the journey

237
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And I also think he's supposed to have a second beer

238
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Cool for spare parts when Trinity breaks down

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And that's now Roger

240
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh yeah, oh yeah, you have a little faith Roger

241
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah, you don't hear from the guy for months

242
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And now he's calling two days after and after another

243
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh Roger, have some faith

244
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Trinity's going to make it

245
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Cars driving just fine

246
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
She's lovely

247
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I remember I got to remember to check the tires

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And make sure there's enough profile on him

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think the tires are okay

250
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Everything else has literally been replaced on this thing

251
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Now normally I play the Trinity jingle

252
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The Jeff Smith free Trinity theme song

253
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I found something in the Podsake music network today

254
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Let me just find out where these guys are from

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The home on the sec

256
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I couldn't I can't believe no one else sent this to me yet

257
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Because it makes so much sense to play this

258
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's from an outfit called 2012 AM

259
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I think

260
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
201 to AM

261
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So I'm just going to say 2012 AM

262
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's see

263
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Let me just read the bio here

264
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
2012 AM is the hottest new esoteric experimental

265
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Alternative break beat band

266
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I've come out of the San Diego

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The San Diego

268
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The San Diego

269
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
This lineup of all star groove masters

270
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Which features DJ Quinique

271
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Mark Houton

272
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Emily Richards and Jason Brock is a booty shake

273
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And sound generator and leaves audiences

274
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Transdanced out

275
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Well how can you not

276
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
When you read that

277
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You're like hey I got to play this

278
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Particularly

279
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
When the title

280
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Is about all American hero

281
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Willie Nelson

282
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Check out biodiesel Willie

283
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This might make it a lie to think into the tunnel

284
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Some of the places where we go

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There are people who come to the concert

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So then you can spend your love

287
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And my sister right there

288
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
One pair of set bio decent

289
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
One pair of set bio decent

290
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This might make it a lie to think into the tunnel

291
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
This might make it a lie to think into the tunnel

292
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Just a game

293
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Just a game

294
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Just a game

295
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If you see a city

296
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Back up to the world

297
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
My burning pain

298
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm living my closest and far

299
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's a gift

300
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Every time we change it

301
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah

302
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
One pair of set bio decent

303
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
One pair of set bio decent

304
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000

One pair of set bio decent

One pair of set bio decent

307
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
One pair of set bio decent

One pair of set bio decent

One pair of set bio decent

316
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000

One pair of set bio decent

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
One pair of set bio decent

324
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
One pair of set bio decent

325
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
One pair of set bio decent

326
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
One pair of set bio decent

327
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
One pair of set bio decent

328
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
One pair of set bio decent

329
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000

One pair of set bio decent

One pair of set bio decent

One pair of sets bio decent

336

One pair of set bio auction

337
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,440
resources and terribly unfair to those arrested and their families.

338
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,440
It's time we stopped arresting adults who smoke marijuana responsibly.

339
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:06,120
For more information, visit normal's website at www.normal.org or call toll-free 888-67

340
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,440
normal and tell them will they sent you?

341
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
No!

342
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Tell them will they sent you?

343
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,320
Hi, I was kind of an interesting experiment with 2012 AM.

344
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,680
I think I have to be in the club to fully appreciate biodiesel-Willie.

345
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,680
Hi, hi, yeah.

346
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,680
Okay, hold on.

347
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,480
You're someone's weird with my windows laptop.

348
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,460
When I right click on something on the desktop it takes like 10 minutes for a contextual

349
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,760
menu to come up and I can't close windows and shit.

350
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,060
It's still running though, which is kind of the cool thing.

351
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,720
Talk about bum rush the charts yesterday.

352
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,280
This is where we want to show.

353
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,160
I think ourselves mainly, but it would be nice to hold up a fist to mainstream, the music

354
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,600
industry and the broadcasting industry go really hand-in-hand when it comes to

355
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,480
mainstream and making hits as is proven by the recent pay-o-la scandal between the

356
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,800
four of the largest radio companies in the United States taking money directly or indirectly

357
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,000
through independent record promoters in exchange for airplay, which of course, it's such

358
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,040
a backwards, isn't it a weird world where in the mainstream world where the system is all

359
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:19,560
set up and oiled and it's been working fine for, I don't know, 40, 30, 40 years

360
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,600
and you know, no one's been making too many ways.

361
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,960
We've had a couple of pay-o-la scandals in the past, but these things just keep coming

362
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,040
back in waves, because that's the way it works, you know, it's just, there's no way to

363
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,120
regulate that, you know, interpersonal contact and high things are added to playlists.

364
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,560
But anyway, so here you have the record companies, the RIA associated record companies paying

365
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,400
radio stations to play songs in their limited resources, which of course belong to

366
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,800
you and I as well, the airwaves, you know, yes, they're licensed out to individual companies,

367
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,960
but you know, there are airwaves too, it's just like the skies, you know, not everyone

368
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,000
can fly over the United States, not everyone can land at any airport, all that shit is licensed,

369
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
because it's also ours.

370
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,160
Now other people are making those decisions for us, of course, in government, and obviously

371
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,680
we get the government we deserve as those any nation.

372
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:16,680
But it's so crazy that when it comes to playing, you know, those songs, the catalog, whatever

373
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,880
it is, maybe it's only 100,000 songs that they're really actively concerned about on a daily

374
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,240
basis.

375
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,960
You can't play those in a podcast.

376
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,360
In fact, it works exactly the, oh, here comes that contextual menu, gee, thanks.

377
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,560
In fact, it works exactly the opposite.

378
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,000
You have to pay for the privilege to play the songs.

379
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,800
So it's kind of skewed, isn't it?

380
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,840
Whereas probably the people who would want to play licensed music are probably big fans.

381
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,520
That, of course, this is all because of the ludicrous thought that these downloads of podcast,

382
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,880
that that would negate legal sales of songs.

383
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,560
No more than radio does, I guess.

384
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,280
I've never been a CD buyer.

385
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,560
I've always been a radio listener.

386
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,960
So I don't know, I guess you'll never get me anyway as a buyer.

387
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,120
But anyway, so the idea is to show that there is quite a lot of power in our open society

388
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,720
of podcasting independent audio in the broadest sense of the word, not just people who

389
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,280
play songs, but also those who create them.

390
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,560
And of course, we have the Podsate Music Network set up, which works quite well.

391
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,920
It's a beautiful ecosystem where podcasts are to complete this music, free of charge,

392
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:33,240
audiences can enjoy it, free of charge, and the artists get exposure, and they also find

393
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,800
that out when a song has been played.

394
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,040
It's kind of closes up, you know, it makes sense.

395
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,640
We've got people making charts off of this information, like the Podsate Music was a

396
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,560
PMC top 10, the Podsate Music Countdown, well, all kinds of stuff like that.

397
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,440
So March 22nd, the ideas were going to bum rush the iTunes charts, which, of course,

398
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,120
these download charts these days now make a difference in overall perception of the success

399
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,920
of music.

400
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,520
And we truly believe that there is enough audience.

401
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,160
There are enough podcasters and associated audience who will click on a link spend 99 cents

402
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,040
on March 22nd to buy one single track to get that track moved up into the top of the

403
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,120
iTunes download and for pay download chart.

404
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,200
So the song that's chosen is Black Lab, mine again, and the way it's going to work.

405
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,560
If you go to bum rush, the charts dot blog spot, actually you can go to bum rush the charts

406
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,840
dot com, the way it will work is if you participate.

407
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,720
And as a listener, you can also participate.

408
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,480
Obviously, the whole idea is to get the network effect kicking in so that, you know, if you

409
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,960
don't have to have a podcast to put this affiliate link up on your page, the affiliate

410
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:49,160
link, by the way, is proceeds to go directly to education and the band has also put up

411
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,160
half of their take for the ghost stores education as well.

412
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,520
You know, we actually, we have a promo.

413
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
How professional is that?

414
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,160
We're almost like the big boys aren't we?

415
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,360
On March 22nd, you can make history, yes, you.

416
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,640
On March 22nd, you and your fellow podcast listeners will be working together to bum rush

417
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
the charts.

418
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,840
What's that?

419
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,880
On March 22nd, we're all going to buy a song from the iTunes music store from a

420
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,560
pot-safe musician, mine again by Black Lab, to put a pot-safe musician at the top of the iTunes

421
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
charts.

422
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,280
But there's more than just that.

423
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,160
We'll all be buying through an affiliate program to raise money for college scholarships,

424
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,480
and the band has agreed to donate 50% of their earnings to the scholarship fund to help

425
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,080
needy families make college affordable.

426
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,920
Make history, show the world that you are in charge of media, not corporate radio and record

427
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
labels.

428
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:47,280
bum rush the charts on March 22nd, learn more about how to bum rush at www.bum rushthecharts.com

429
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:55,400
Chris Pan from the financial uh, financial aid podcast.

430
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Great promo, Chris.

431
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,080
Now, people are coming up with all kinds of ideas to make this play even better.

432
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,160
I really like this because of course, you know, we're going to do everything we can

433
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,400
to bribe the audience, listen to the difference there.

434
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,200
Record companies bribe radio stations to spam the audience and podcasters bribe the audience

435
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,480
to spam the mainstream record companies on their own chart.

436
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,880
Maybe we just don't have enough to do during the day.

437
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,960
But there's more that you can actually win something now.

438
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,040
And this is something that is going to be set up through the daily source code that just

439
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
came in today.

440
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
I kind of like the idea.

441
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,920
Anything that'll get us more traction on bum rush the charts.

442
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
I'm a fan.

443
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,040
I'll check out this concept.

444
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:45,160
We say podcasting doesn't matter who are they that the record industry, that the radio

445
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:51,760
industry, maybe they're right, maybe we don't matter.

446
00:22:51,760 --> 00:23:03,360
But maybe we do on March 22nd 2007, we all have a assignment, sure.

447
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:11,200
We have things to do, sure we have places to go, but there's one thing that we all

448
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,320
have to do.

449
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:22,680
Go over to iTunes and buy the track from Black Lab and toddler's might again.

450
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:35,640
The cost is 99 cents, but this one day, don't go buy the Frappuccino, it's been 99 cents

451
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,400
and it could be a price.

452
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,960
And yes, I'm going to put my money where my mouth is.

453
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:48,800
For the receipt you receive from iTunes to Adam at curry.com and then the subject line

454
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,800
to it, I made a difference.

455
00:23:51,800 --> 00:24:00,800
One entry per person please, you know, March 30th 2007, Adam will draw off from these names.

456
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:11,920
And the winner will receive a iTunes gift certificate worth $100 courtesy of PotShowReadyow.com.

457
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:19,840
So don't forget, in March 22nd, it's your turn to make a difference.

458
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,320
So you can win 100 bucks and it immediately incentivizes me to get my, I got the Google

459
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,080
apps premiere edition for curry.com.

460
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,360
So I'm slowly implementing everything I don't want to mess up anyone's email, who is also

461
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
on curry.com.

462
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,160
So that'll be working by then.

463
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
Won't it now?

464
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Yes.

465
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
I'm sure we'll.

466
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
My older geeky go talk in there.

467
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
I'm going to make it happen.

468
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,920
Folks, listening to serious satellite stars, 102, we've got a great line of 40 this evening.

469
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,560
Coming up after the break, I think it's a number one with a bullet with Mark Hirsch

470
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Motor Nemkov.

471
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,280
In fact, I know it is.

472
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,680
Oh, let me see, yesterday kind of made a joke out of a good old Paul there as I was talking

473
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,840
about voiceover IP systems and he called in and he's a consultant and just implemented

474
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
a voice system.

475
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,640
I was amazed at how crappy the quality of his call was and well, he called back, of course.

476
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,240
Adam, it's Paul again from Kirk and Washington.

477
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,560
You mentioned, I moved voiceover IP comment and I wanted to make a correction for you.

478
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:25,000
I was actually talking to you on my singular Sony Ericsson cell phone in traffic with

479
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,360
my job owned DSP processor headsets and I guess the DSP when it's recording on voice

480
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:38,720
now like you have doesn't, doesn't, doesn't, doesn't, it has some degradation apparently.

481
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,120
Anyway, my point was, this is a packet eight might be a voice solution that you should

482
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,080
look at that, but I used words a lot better than the recording and we're going to remember

483
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:57,000
not to use my DSP headset when I'm leaving voice now because apparently the volume levels

484
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,560
quite low.

485
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:05,080
So anyway, that was a point of my voice now and thanks for doing what you do and folder.

486
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,800
Yeah, all right, man.

487
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Okay.

488
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,640
Sounded much better.

489
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,960
You know, whenever someone, I mean, all this digital recording stuff, everything is

490
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,720
a digital recording.

491
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,760
So of course, a cell phone call these days is a digital call.

492
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,160
It comes in and I wonder when it comes into the voice mail bank, I guess there's no audio,

493
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,240
there is no actual analog signal passed off.

494
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,520
So then it gets transcoded into the voice mail system, which uses the GSM protocol, which

495
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,040
is very, very low, low bandwidth, I then have to, or low bandwidth, low bit rate, I then

496
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:44,040
have to convert that to AIFF and then from AIFF to MP3 and before you know it, well,

497
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,560
I'd have to say this thing sound like total shit.

498
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,320
Regardless, please give us a call.

499
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,600
Here's the UK number for you.

500
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,760
For those of you in the United States, or if you're using any version of a tip protocol-based

501
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,440
voice system, this will be a free call for you.

502
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:35,120
Now, then again, it may not be a free call, but virtually a free call for you.

503
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Hi, Adam Jack from GetJackPodcast.com, you know, you've made a mistake on today, it's Wednesday,

504
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,800
March 7th, but the podcast says that it's March 8th, which would be tomorrow, a date

505
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:53,040
I'm intimately aware of, because not only is it the day that Jersey Todd scheduled his

506
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,840
next child to be born, and isn't it odd that one can schedule these things?

507
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,880
They have busy lives, best do it on Thursday and have the weekend.

508
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,520
Anyway, it's also my birthday tomorrow, March 8th, so I think what you should do is send

509
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:13,040
Jersey Todd a Nokia N800 Internet tablet, so you can do videos of the new child and send

510
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,360
him up to Pod Show and for all to see, and go ahead and send me one to you, because it's

511
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
my birthday.

512
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
Okay.

513
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,360
GetJackPodcast.com.

514
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,800
You know, and I think Jersey Todd would, I had a quick email exchange with Jersey Todd.

515
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,280
The day indeed, in fact, he sent me a note about an hour ago, and he said that the

516
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,520
sea section was about to commence in 20 minutes, so by now we probably have a Jersey

517
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:45,320
Toddlet wandering around, but you'd be, I think you'd both be very disappointed if you

518
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:51,760
wanted to use the N800, the N800's built-in camera to take pictures of anything other

519
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,320
than, you know, like, for a web, you know, like a web conference thing or just a reference

520
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,680
photo.

521
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:07,120
That's the, I have to say, that's kind of a bummer, it's like a VGA quality camera, it's

522
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,880
not even, I don't even think it's a megapixel, it's really a shame because, you know, the

523
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,200
sound is great on the N800, it does some awesome things because it's a full powered

524
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,120
computer, basically, running a full operating system, but the, but the camera is crap,

525
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,560
so you'd probably do better with the, with a different camera, but, you know, just listening

526
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,760
to that kind of, you know, makes me think, like, you guys think, I'm actually I'm looking

527
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:36,640
for a song here, it reminded me of a song, let me see, the hell, I think my bandwidth

528
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:43,320
is host again, crap, oh, I hate it when this happens, let me see, let me try the artist.

529
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:50,800
Uh, I'm not going to tell you what it is as I'm typing it in because I would give it away.

530
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:58,120
Well, this may not work, hold on, stop, man, Windows media player sometimes is such an

531
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,520
incredible piece of shit, it, it will freeze up, you know, particularly if you're logged

532
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,840
into Napster, it's like it's waiting for data from Napster and it just sits there and

533
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,800
it freaks out and, and it won't move and then you hit the stop button on the search and

534
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,160
fuck it, it's not going to work, okay, maybe I'll look at my first gen iPods, see if I can find

535
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
it.

536
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,400
You remember these guys played them quite a bit about a year ago, they're back with a

537
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:30,600
brand new song, they are from Sweden, so, you know, they're going to look out for

538
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:39,240
those Swedes, remember New Leaf, Mr. New one is titled Other Side.

539
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:54,200
You can't do those, no student fire, but your food, I do let you go, don't kill me inside

540
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:05,240
I need so bad, they tattoos and I aren't as bad, you don't see enough so fast and you fall away

541
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:17,640
to be bad, you got bad to me for sure, but I'm going to buy it, let's make up for this

542
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:30,400
gen iPods, see if I can find it, let's make up for this gen iPods, see if I can find it, let's make up for this

543
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:46,400
gen iPods, see if I can find it, let's make up for this gen iPods, see if I can find it, let's make up for this gen

544
00:31:46,400 --> 00:32:16,400
iPods, see if I can find it, let's make up for this gen iPods, see if I can find it, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up

545
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:46,400
for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for this gen iPods, let's make up for

546
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:53,400
I'm the other side

547
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:01,400
I'm the other side

548
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,400
The cry on me is too high

549
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,400
To keep me on the side

550
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:19,400
With a broken glass I let it to live

551
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Now it's all too late

552
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,400
You got back to me for sure

553
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,400
But I don't want it

554
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Let's make up for this good night on the other side

555
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Life is yours

556
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,400
It has only begun

557
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,400
You got back to me for sure

558
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,400
But I don't want it

559
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm the other side

560
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Well, it's definitely something very different from their previous track

561
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,400
I love so much which was a magic carpet

562
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Yeah, that's the guy from Sweden, New Leaf

563
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,400
The other side on DSC559

564
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
And it, thank you

565
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Alright, I've got one

566
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
What's playing on

567
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Adam's first gen I bought

568
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Let's take a look

569
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Adam's first gen I bought

570
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Let's take a look

571
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,400
It was a song that I was reminded by this song

572
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,400
By people think that I'm the guy that hands out

573
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
The Nokia devices in the Pottersphere

574
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Some would also call me The Candy Man perhaps

575
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Candy Man perhaps

576
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Candy Man

577
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Candy Man

578
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
Alright, everybody

579
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Get around the Candy Man here

580
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
What kind of candy you want?

581
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
The sweet chocolate

582
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Chocolate's more the candy

583
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Come drops, anything you want

584
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
You come to the right man

585
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Because I'm the Candy Man

586
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
One, two, three

587
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Who can take a sunrise

588
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
We put it with you

589
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
We put it with you

590
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Cover it with chocolate and a miracle

591
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,400
To the Candy Man

592
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
Candy Man

593
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Who the Candy Man can

594
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Candy Man can

595
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Candy Man can

596
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Because he mixes it with love

597
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
And makes the world taste good

598
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
It's the wildest one

599
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,400
Who can take a rainbow

600
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Come on man

601
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Does it put you in a happy mood when you hear that

602
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,400
It's probably also going from one of my favorite movies of all time

603
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Willy Wonka's chocolate factory

604
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,400
It's Sammy Davis Jr. in the Candy Man

605
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,400
What's playing on

606
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Who's first

607
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Can I find

608
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,400
A Jeff, you kill me man

609
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Alright everybody, that's it for the Daily Stories Code for today

610
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Tomorrow we'll be celebrating Fubar Friday in style

611
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,400
And hopefully we'll have some news from Jersey Todd

612
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
I'm the New Jersey toddler walking around

613
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Which should have been born by today

614
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,400
And I believe Brian from audio attitudes is going to

615
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Slide into the place of a visual musicologist of the Cha Cha

616

621
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,400
What's playing on

Adam's first Jedi Bond

623
