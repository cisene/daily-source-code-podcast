1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,900
Well, hey there, I'm Mr. Curry, this year's Elvis, Elvis, I don't know if you saw me

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,800
I was standing out in the front yard of Graceland, you're flying overhead going to New

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,240
York and I was waving, in the case you didn't, I would just wanted to tell you that there's

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,440
really nothing I like more than sitting back listening to the Daily Source Code with

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,320
Priscilla and the Colonel in the jungle room, it's really exciting to listen to all the great

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,120
music you have to chronic or our lives and the preservation of our lives is the very

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,160
important thing for Elvis.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,400
More so is to hook up with just Smith one day, if you can get out here to admit this, we'll

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:49,680
make some great jingles for the DSC, for now Mr. Curry, on with this show, shows what you

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,080
got for the DSC, 663 of Fubar Friday, from the King to you, Mr. Curry, I wish it

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,580
Best.

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,360
Amen.

13
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,080
I'm a street or a game

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,080
Dr. Lissie

15
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Do I believe in God?

16
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,080
Do I believe in me?

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,080
Do I believe in me?

18
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,080
Or I believe in God?

19
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Some people want to die

20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
So they can be free

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,080
Dr. Lissie

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Dr. Lissie

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,080
Do I believe in God?

24
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,080
Do I believe in God?

25
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,080
Dr. Lissie

26
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:38,080
I just can't believe all the things we will see

27
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Don't let me see, am I play all right, am I straight or gay?

28
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Don't let me see, I can't understand you, man, to reassity

29
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Don't let me see, but it could see you, was a much more mundane way to be

30
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Don't let me see, I can't understand you, man, to reassity

31
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Don't let me see, don't let me see, don't let me see, don't let me see

32
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Don't let me see, don't let me see, don't let me see, don't let me see, don't let me see, don't let me see, don't let me see, don't let me see, don't let me see

33
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:45,080
You can't hide, but you can't be cry

34
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,080
You can't hide, but you can't be cry

35
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,080
You can't hide, but you can't be cry

36
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,080
You can't hide, but you can't be cry

37
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,080
You can't hide, but you can't be cry

38
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:11,080
You can't hide, but you can't be cry

39
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,080
Some people wanna die, so they can be free

40
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,080
Don't try to see

41
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,080
Don't try to see

42
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Don't try to see

43
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,080
Don't try to see

44
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Don't try to see

45
00:04:51,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Don't try to see

46
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,080
Don't try to see

47
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Don't try to see

48
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Don't try to see

49
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,080
I can't understand, you meant a real city

50
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Don't let me see you

51
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Was it to see you?

52
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Was I what you wanted me to be?

53
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Don't you see?

54
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Do I believe in God?

55
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Do I believe in me?

56
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Do I believe in me?

57
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,080
All I believe in God?

58
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Some people want to die

59
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
So they can be free

60
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,080
So they can be free

61
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
I said, the love is just a game

62
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,080
We all just the same

63
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Do you want to play?

64
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Do you want to play?

65
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Do you want to play?

66
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Don't you see?

67
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:25,080
Don't you have a seat?

68
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Don't you have a seat?

69
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Don't you have a seat?

70
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:47,080
It's special thanks to James Thompson.

71
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
We found this on YouTube.

72
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Not quite sure how it got through the video got through the YouTube sensors.

73
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
Very, very, no, no.

74
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Let's just say smoking hot video.

75
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:08,080
It's kind of a mash up of, I think the original Crystal Water's Gypsy Woman and some version of Prince's controversy.

76
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Controversy Controversy.

77
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
It is the Daily Source Code.

78
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
It's Monday from the manner.

79
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
What are we out today?

80
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
The 17th of September 2007.

81
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Boy, it's good to be back home.

82
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,080
Good to be talking to you guys.

83
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
It was even a little bit worse than I thought.

84
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:32,080
I thought I would at least be able to get a footballer Friday out last week from the Curri condo.

85
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
No way.

86
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,080
Man, it has, and you know what, it's going to be like this non-stop probably until the Christmas holidays.

87
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
So be prepared.

88
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,080
What's interesting though is it, it really doesn't make much difference in, like my weekly numbers,

89
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
which I check from time to time.

90
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,080
It seems like if I do less episodes, more people listen to them, which is interesting food for thought.

91
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,080
Maybe this whole daily thing doesn't really make any sense in the, in the scene dependent media.

92
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
I don't know.

93
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,080
Unless it's really short, maybe it's too long for a daily program.

94
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,080
Stuff to think about, but oh, so much to talk about today.

95
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
So many things.

96
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
See, when did we last talk?

97
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Was it the 11th of September?

98
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Oh, God.

99
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Since then, of course, I've received tons and tons of feedback about 911 videos and 911 inside job.

100
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,080
And I think even the 9, was it, what's the name?

101
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,080
There's something on there's now a 911 podcast on pod show.

102
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
I got to find that for you.

103
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,080
So again, I'm not really big into, hold on a second.

104
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,080
I'm wearing the Al Jazeera Bathroom a little bit warm up here today.

105
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,080
And I know that I have Amy standing by, so I need to see here.

106
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
There we go.

107
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,080
A little more freedom of movement.

108
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Okay.

109
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,080
So should I recap what I did because it was messed up man.

110
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,080
We went, see, Wednesday, Wednesday night.

111
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
Ron and I flew to New York.

112
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,080
We had a couple meetings Thursday in the apple.

113
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Including, this was a great meeting we had with Ted Leone.

114
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,080
So do you remember Ted and he's, I think he's still the vice chairman of AOL.

115
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:26,080
And I know him, I'll shit Ron and I both know him because back 10, maybe even 15 years back to,

116
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
what was it?

117
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,080
There was the greenhouse project and early days had a great chat with him.

118
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,080
That was a lot of fun to hook up with Ted and New York.

119
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,080
Did the other meetings?

120
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
And we've been busted and asked.

121
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,080
We've been talking to all kinds of advertisers, you know, the Christmas season coming up

122
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,080
and we're working at really, really hard.

123
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Had to go back Thursday evening back to San Francisco because we had on Friday,

124
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:05,080
I met with, this was a cool meeting with the will Hearst of the Hearst Family Empire,

125
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,080
who owned tons and tons of media properties, newspapers, magazines,

126
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,080
and the editor of the Chronicle in San Francisco.

127
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Bronstein, you know this guy.

128
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,080
He used to be married to Sharon Stone.

129
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,080
I don't know if they get a divorce or not.

130
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,080
I didn't ask him, obviously.

131
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,080
So that was kind of fun sitting in the Chronicles offices at San Francisco,

132
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,080
which was really old world like Daily Planet.

133
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,080
You expected Clark Kent to come walking out of the woodwork at any moment.

134
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
That was very interesting.

135
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,080
And, you know, just actually wound up, but by the time we were done, it was like nine o'clock.

136
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:49,080
And Ron and his lovely wife, styled even Marta, moved to a house outside of the city.

137
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,080
So I hadn't seen it yet, even though they've had it for a,

138
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
well, maybe a month now.

139
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,080
So, and even during this two weeks, I hadn't even seen his wife in so incredibly busy.

140
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,080
So we had some nice Chinese food, eight to the beach joined us.

141
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,080
We hung out.

142
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
It was really nice.

143
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,080
And I was like, all right, you know,

144
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,080
I'm, I'm so relaxed.

145
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
I'm starting to unwind.

146
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
By the time I got back, which was, I don't know,

147
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,080
I was back home at the condo around 11.30.

148
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Quarter 12.

149
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
I just didn't have it in me.

150
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,080
I did not have it in me to do a football Friday.

151
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,080
I really apologize.

152
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:27,080
So, and of course, the trip back on Saturday with Virgin Atlantic.

153
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,080
And we just has absolutely no resemblance to Virgin America.

154
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
I'm not even going to get into it.

155
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,080
If you want to, I was so pissed off about just the experience on Virgin America,

156
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,080
but also my most recent experiences with the transportation safety

157
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,080
as it agency or administration agency, I guess, part of the Homeland Security.

158
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Oh, man, this is so frustrating.

159
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
It just takes shit.

160
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
You know, I think they just look at,

161
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,080
it said, hey, wait a minute, this guy's got some nice colon.

162
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Yeah, I think I need that.

163
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
I think I'll take this from this guy.

164
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
So messed up.

165
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
And you can travel around with my bag,

166
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
it's filled with transmitters.

167
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
We don't need no stinky transmitters.

168
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
You know, my wireless mic transmitter,

169
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080
tons of wires, batteries, all, you know,

170
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,080
four different Nokia devices,

171
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
lighters,

172
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
possibly some other contraband.

173
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
But oh, no, what can we have to take away

174
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
the guys to deodorant?

175
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
Shit.

176
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,080
I meant this one.

177
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Hi, it's Arthur's Iron from the SNS.com site.

178
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Just a little bit about the aircraft security

179
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,080
and how they seem to help people having my own face.

180
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Well, the main reason behind that is

181
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,080
it's so called binary liquid explosives.

182
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,080
We've got two separate liquids that are found on the run,

183
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,080
but it makes them a bit complicated.

184
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,080
The majority of it, however, is bullshit

185
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
because it's difficult enough to touch

186
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,080
the transport, well, produce and then

187
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,080
transport these things when you're an expert on it.

188
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,080
And you've got all of the relative stuff.

189
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
And I'm a chair that's going to be,

190
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,080
that's going to actually be trying to put this on to an airplane.

191
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Doesn't stand the fucking chance without blowing themselves up.

192
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
It's total.

193
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
And it's bullshit.

194
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Well, so leave you with this one.

195
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
See you later.

196
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
Bye.

197
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Now, I'm, of course, this bullshit.

198
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
And it would be okay if it was a little more consistent.

199
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
You know, we traveled in New York.

200
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
I didn't want to check a bag.

201
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,080
So my carry on bag, and I had my toiletries in there

202
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
because, you know, I was going to take a shower

203
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
when we got to New York.

204
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,080
And so on the way over, what did they take from me?

205
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
They took my mouth wash.

206
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,080
It was, you know, a clear plastic bottle of

207
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,080
Listerine.

208
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Clear.

209
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
You know, as you can see right through,

210
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
you can see what's in it.

211
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Had never been open, still had the seal on it.

212
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Oh, no, it's too big.

213
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,080
You know, it's kind of unclear what the size,

214
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
what size you're allowed to take.

215
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Apparently, if you have like little samples from hotel rooms,

216
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
it's okay.

217
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,080
But if you have like a, and this wasn't like the family size.

218
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
This was just a personal size, you know?

219
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Nope, got to take that.

220
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Uh, what else do they take from me?

221
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Well, everything else was cool.

222
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
But then on the way back, and then it was also,

223
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
I think it was like trainee day.

224
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
I was in the line for 45 minutes.

225
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,080
So besides, you know, taking off your shoes and all that.

226
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
And, you know, then it was like, well,

227
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
no, you can't have your hair gel.

228
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
You can't have, and with small sizes, right?

229
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080
You can't have your deodorant.

230
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,080
You can't have your, uh,

231
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,080
uh, what a have clinic happy.

232
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,080
Uh, what else do they take from me?

233
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Uh, moisturizer.

234
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
You know, just all the shit, but the,

235
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,080
the thing that really hurts me is the,

236
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,080
is the, is the way that this is done.

237
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Now it's getting so clear that this is a fucking power trip

238
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,080
from the TSA, not all TSA, of course.

239
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
But, oh, man.

240
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
And now that these guys are government,

241
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
this is the same people who used to do airport security before.

242
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
So now they have nicer uniforms and,

243
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
and their government officials.

244
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,080
So you can't, like, fuck with them.

245
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,080
You can't have a big mouth.

246
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
You got a big mouth.

247
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
Oh, that's what, then all of a sudden,

248
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
shit really starts to slow down.

249
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,080
And, oh, we have to run your bag again.

250
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Meanwhile, you know,

251
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,080
Ron was at the gate with his foot in the door of the airplane,

252
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
trying to keep it,

253
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
prevent him from leaving without me.

254
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,080
This was just horrible, man.

255
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
It's just horrible.

256
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,080
I can't even get into how stupid it is.

257
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Look, either we really do security,

258
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,080
or we just kind of, you know,

259
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
just do the standard stuff.

260
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080
You know, look for guns, weapons,

261
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
other things.

262
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,080
This liquid shit is out of control.

263
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,080
It's so stupid.

264
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
All right, okay.

265
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,080
It's been a while, and I've had a big star next to this

266
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
in my Gmail.

267
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,080
I've been trying to do a show in general,

268
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
but also trying to do one with my babies.

269
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Yes.

270
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
And from all that airplane ride,

271
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
and I got to tell you,

272
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
my ass is fluffy again.

273
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,080
So Amy Max here to firm it up for me.

274
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
With the gluteus Maximus portion of the bag.

275
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Hey Adam, it's Amy Max.

276
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
It's been weak.

277
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Yes, I know.

278
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,080
My emails were continuously being rejected by your email account,

279
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
which has clearly decided on its own

280
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
that we should no longer communicate.

281
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
No, no, no, no.

282
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
It's not correct.

283
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
We should.

284
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
And so happy we were able to straighten everything out

285
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
that while you're in town.

286
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
So now that we're back on track,

287
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
let's get down to business.

288
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
Okay.

289
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
You're going to be lying on your back today.

290
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
So switch mics and get yourself situated.

291
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Okay, I'm situated now.

292
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
I'm on my back.

293
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,080
Now put your legs straight up in the air.

294
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
Okay.

295
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
And then put your hands behind your head.

296
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
Okay.

297
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Lift those shoulders off the ground.

298
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,080
Oh, ow.

299
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,080
Now lower your right leg and twist your right elbow towards your left leg.

300
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Oh, yes, I feel that.

301
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
And then switch.

302
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,080
And to the left.

303
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,080
You should be squeezing your butt and your stomach.

304
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Make sure that you don't pull on your neck when you twist.

305
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
Okay.

306
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
Switch again.

307
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,080
You should feel the butt flexing every time you switch those legs.

308
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
I can feel your butt flexing.

309
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
Don't forget to breathe.

310
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
All right.

311
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Now a few more switches.

312
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,080
One more squeeze.

313
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,080
Breathe.

314
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,080
And squeeze.

315
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
And breathe.

316
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,080
Okay.

317
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,080
Last four quickly.

318
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
One.

319
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Two.

320
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Three.

321
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
Four.

322
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
And relax.

323
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,080
Great job.

324
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Now to make up for no butt squeeze this time.

325
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Since we were feuding a little bit.

326
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,080
All squeezed twice.

327
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Next time I see you.

328
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
I promise.

329
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
Oh, I can't wait for that.

330
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
All right.

331
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Hugs to the girls.

332
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
Oh, and one last thing.

333
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
Yes.

334
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,080
I've started a 90 day fit life challenge to anyone wanting to shape up a bit before the holidays.

335
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,080
So if you could pass on the link to the training group site,

336
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,080
which is free to join, I would love to invite all the DSC listeners to join us.

337
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
Right.

338
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,080
Until next time.

339
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
Oh, baby.

340
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Thank you very much, Amy.

341
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Yes.

342
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
She refused to squeeze my ass at the office.

343
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
She said, oh, no.

344
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Well, you haven't been doing the answers.

345
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
I said, I don't know.

346
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
I didn't receive it.

347
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
Or I got it.

348
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,080
And I lost it in the email.

349
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
I don't know.

350
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Send it to me again.

351
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
So there was no squeezing.

352
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,080
So she couldn't really mark down progress.

353
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
But I'm pretty sure I've gone into remission.

354
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,080
With all this sitting on my ass that I'm doing.

355
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
Really, as it's like sit on my ass in the studio.

356
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
Sit on my ass in the car.

357
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
Sit on my ass in the condo.

358
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
Actually, the condo.

359
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
I don't sit on my ass that much.

360
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
I don't have any place to sit.

361
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
I have the couch.

362
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
I'm on the couch that I'm left.

363
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
I'm left.

364
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,080
I'm walking around standing.

365
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,080
Thank you.

366
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
That feels very good.

367
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
I miss so much cool stuff.

368
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,080
And if only I had known what was going on this weekend,

369
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,080
I might have even considered at least extending my stay.

370
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
Adam is running.

371
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,080
And that's the airport on my way to Reno.

372
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
I've got a long way over in Reno.

373
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
And you know what's going on this weekend?

374
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
The Reno air races.

375
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
We're planning on my part.

376
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
I should have called you a long time ago.

377
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Yeah.

378
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
I hope you're still around.

379
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
And you know what?

380
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
If you can make it to the Reno air races,

381
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,080
it is absolutely something worth seeing.

382
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Seeing a piston powered airplane fly at speeds faster than the red line of the

383
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
810 that I used to fly.

384
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
That's pretty amazing.

385
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Hopefully you can make it.

386
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
Like I said, short notice.

387
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,080
But I'll give you an update from the air show at the Reno air races.

388
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
We'll talk to you soon.

389
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Tailwinds.

390
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Tailwinds my friends.

391
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
So that's Robin, of course.

392
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,080
From inside works and produces diva cast.

393
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,080
And he is a pilot for a major US airline.

394
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,080
I actually thought I heard him the other day when I was at San Francisco as a.

395
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,080
When I took United to San Diego for that.

396
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,080
I media thing that I was a lot of fun, by the way.

397
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Yeah, I thought I heard him on that.

398
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Because United has Channel 9 from the flight deck.

399
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
I sure was Robin.

400
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
It wasn't.

401
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
So I guess he was off to Reno.

402
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,080
And of course he called in, you know, just to rub it all in that I wasn't there.

403
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,080
Listen to this.

404
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,080
That's some hard hit and fast pace.

405
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
Nitro burning piston power.

406
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
The final phase.

407
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Reno air races.

408
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
There's Robin's sailing.

409
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Yeah.

410
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
Yeah.

411
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
Yeah.

412
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Again, it's really time to get behind the controls of the Delta Sheriff.

413
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Mine actually be going to Friday at to Friday on Germany to Germany on Friday.

414
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
So that'll be a nice trip to make.

415
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,080
And I think the girls have some kind of a ward show they want to go to.

416
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,080
So there could be some flying in the near in the near future.

417
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
Really hope so.

418
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Because the weather, of course, is going to start get pretty shit pretty soon.

419
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Which will limit some of the possibilities.

420
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Not all, but some of them.

421
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Some days of flying.

422
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,080
And so of course back here in the in the in the curry manner with the girls.

423
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,080
Good to see them and you know, we had a really sad.

424
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Past couple of weeks is our darling Cindy was was killed.

425
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Just outside our door.

426
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,080
And you know, of course we've been sharing this throughout the past few weeks.

427
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Mainly over over the phone or a couple times an eye chat.

428
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,080
And but we really didn't have a chance to be together.

429
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,080
Yeah, and and grieve, I guess.

430
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,080
And Raymond poured y'all know Raymond.

431
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,080
He's a part of a podcasting legend certainly for the daily source code.

432
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,080
He's the guy that very early on is I was recording a show on a highway going towards Belgium.

433
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,080
He was honking next to me. He was listening to the previous day show.

434
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,080
Real moment in podcast history.

435
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,080
I'll see if I can find that episode stick it into the DSC channel.

436
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:35,080
He put together a beautiful kind of slideshow a quick time movie with pieces from the show that I dedicated to Cindy with the song.

437
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,080
Thank you for being a friend.

438
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,080
And and he sent a copy to Patricia and and I knew what was going to happen.

439
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
So she fired it up and it.

440
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,080
And so it was very emotional obviously.

441
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,080
And you know, it's kind of a personal thing and there's a lot of Dutch in it.

442
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
So it's not something I put out publicly.

443
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,080
And Raymond wants to that's obviously very cool and then I'll put a link.

444
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,080
I'll check I'll see if he posted it and I'll put a link to it.

445
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,080
But that of course got us both going.

446
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,080
And it actually was really a great moment because we needed some kind of catalyst to, you know,

447
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,080
to kind of get get the emotions out there and it worked.

448
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
I appreciate it Raymond.

449
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,080
It was I know that wasn't exactly why you intended to do it,

450
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
but it really did work and it was important.

451
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,080
So I appreciate that.

452
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,080
And we have a new cat.

453
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,080
And I'm happy that the girls went out and did this because I know it helps.

454
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
You know, I've had many, many pets.

455
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
We've had many pets.

456
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,080
None that have come to their end in such a dramatic tragic and sudden fashion.

457
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,080
So the hurt is is very deep in the shock is still very prevalent.

458
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,080
But they went out and they got from the from the animal shelter.

459
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,080
They got the cutest little black pussy.

460
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
Black pussy cat.

461
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,080
He is and they call him Mickey.

462
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Mickey, the mixer, the mickenheimer, the micken dick a ding-dong.

463
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,080
He's I don't know how he's the only couple, maybe a couple months old.

464
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,080
I'll have to ask Patricia, but he is so cute and so sweet.

465
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:03,080
And he of course is filling a lot of the void here in the house.

466
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,080
Now ginger, other cat is not quite on board with the program.

467
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,080
And also, you know, he's also traumatized.

468
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,080
So you know, we got a, we got to give out lots of hugs and lots of stuff we got to do

469
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,080
with our, with our little animals.

470
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
I was going to, I'm just looking here.

471
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
I was going to play something for you.

472
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
I hear it is.

473
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,080
I'm not used to using the two button mouse anymore.

474
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Hold on.

475
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
Here we go.

476
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,080
So what I was going to say, speaking of of pussy pussy cats.

477
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Mark Yosher motor nem cough from Pacific Coast hallway.

478
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
I'm not quite sure what the deal is.

479
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,080
And I'm sure you'll listen to PCH and they'll give you the low down.

480
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
But he came to me.

481
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
He came to me several weeks.

482
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Actually, before I left for for the States and he said, look, we're doing a,

483
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
a musical.

484
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,080
It's called pussy, the musical, an audio book.

485
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,080
And there's a, it's, so it's a musical.

486
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,080
And he got like 10 songs.

487
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,080
And he got people from around the net to to sing these songs.

488
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,080
I guess he wrote and he played the instruments.

489
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,080
And see, he's got Angie B doing a song.

490
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,080
He's got to PW Fenton doing a song.

491
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
He does a song.

492
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,080
He's got this is like, like 10 different.

493
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,080
So it is.

494
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,080
And you know, I call it his version of, you know, I call it help.

495
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Was it a Pacific Coast hallway musical too.

496
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,080
And I guess it's coming out soon.

497
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Pussy the musical dot pod showed dot com.

498
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
And so he asked me to do a song.

499
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,080
And I said, ah, what the, I'll do one for you.

500
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,080
And this is what we came up with.

501
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,080
It's kind of a boy band sound.

502
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,080
And of course, please recall that I'm not a singer.

503
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Come over here, girl.

504
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,080
There's a part of me that's the kind.

505
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,080
When I'm with the boys out drinking, there's some special.

506
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,080
About you, girl.

507
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,080
If I'm not thinking about all of you.

508
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,080
I'm sure I'm thinking about part of you.

509
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
Snatch.

510
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,080
My heart belongs to you.

511
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
Snatch.

512
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,080
I love you darling.

513
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,080
I'm here dreaming every day.

514
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,080
To be snatched by your love.

515
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
Overwhelming.

516
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Snatch.

517
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,080
I love you.

518
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Even if you're not here with me,

519
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,080
I want to be the one who has this feeling.

520
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,080
Inside of you.

521
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,080
If you're just given a link to me.

522
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,080
Maybe someday, girl, you will see.

523
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
Snatch.

524
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,080
My heart belongs to you.

525
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,080
Snatch.

526
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,080
I love you darling, true.

527
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,080
Some guys would probably pay

528
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,080
To be snatched by your love.

529
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,080
Overwhelming.

530
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,080
If I'm chasing you without too much haste,

531
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:47,080
Please, girl, don't think that it's in better days.

532
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
Snatch.

533
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,080
My heart belongs to you.

534
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
Snatch.

535
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
I love you darling.

536
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,080
I'm here dreaming every day.

537
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,080
Snatch.

538
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
I love you darling, true.

539
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
Snatch.

540
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
I love you darling.

541
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Snatch.

542
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
Snatch.

543
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,080
My heart belongs to you.

544
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Snatch.

545
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:41,080
Oh, I love you, not in truth, the singing that song makes me feel gay, let me be snatched by your love away.

546
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,080
That's right, from pussy the musical.

547
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
Snatched.

548
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,080
And that is, of course, the lovely lady Patricia, they're doing background vocals for me.

549
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,080
That's right, it's a family affair.

550
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,080
Find it at pussythemusical.podshow.com.

551
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,080
God knows what it's going to be about.

552
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:08,080
This is your daily source code episode number 663, where we discuss maybe anything.

553
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,080
And everything, including toilet habits.

554
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,080
Adam is narrows calling from Sydney, Australia.

555
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,080
Night regarding the toilet seat-out toilet seat-down scenario.

556
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:28,080
I think it's a damn good idea that you're working on the toilet seat-down practice for all members of the family.

557
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,080
Not just the actual seat itself of the holiday.

558
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,080
My wife was reading an article reading a book of the wall back at that junse.

559
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,080
And scarily enough, I recommend a toilet seat-out when they flush in the room.

560
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:47,080
The junse in the ball, which they would probably be 20, can be slung out knitted by a huff flushing action.

561
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,080
So, leave them, damn good idea.

562
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
That's disgusting, dude.

563
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,080
And I have read this before.

564
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,080
So, there's another piece of the protocol, close the lid before you flush.

565
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,080
Which, of course, is exactly how my iPhone got fucked up in the first place.

566
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
Hey, how about that, huh?

567
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
Did a whole trip...

568
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
Was in the United States for two weeks?

569
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Did not visit the Apple Store?

570
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
Did not pass go?

571
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,080
Did not buy in a new iPhone?

572
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,080
Yeah, I think I'm kind of waiting for the iPod Touch.

573
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,080
But, of course, I re-invigorated my use of the Nokia N800.

574
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,080
And I got to tell you, I've been enjoying it again.

575
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,080
I enjoy the battery life first and foremost.

576
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,080
And now we've got the special channel set up.

577
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,080
There's a new application for the N800.

578
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,080
It's the video center application.

579
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,080
And so, we've set up two channels.

580
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,080
You can read more about it at Nokia.podshow.com.

581
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
And we've got some pretty cool, pretty big plans.

582
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Also, if you have an N95, there's also a special feed for you there.

583
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,080
I've got a call schedule with Luke the Candy Man later on this week.

584
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
I think we're, we've got some...

585
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,080
It looks like we're finally getting some traction here between our two companies.

586
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,080
And one day, Nokia might actually be a big company.

587
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,080
You know, they might have to acquire them.

588
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
Hi Adam, it's Angie P.

589
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,080
I saw you on cranky geeks the other day at the live feed.

590
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,080
And, gosh, you are such a charming devil.

591
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,080
Oh, darling.

592
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,080
Couldn't take my eyes away from you, baby.

593
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
You did a good job.

594
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
Oh, man, I'm so behind on everything.

595
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
I know I haven't talked to you in forever.

596
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
And I feel so bad.

597
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,080
So this was like a really great excuse to give you a buzz.

598
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,080
And then what?

599
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Was that it?

600
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
That's not possible.

601
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
What happened?

602
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Oh, crap.

603
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
Oh, hold on a second.

604
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,080
Let me go back to my Gmail.

605
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,080
Now, this sometimes happens if you...

606
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,080
If you get an attachment through Gmail and then you...

607
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,080
Where's cranky geeks audio comment here it is.

608
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,080
And if you...

609
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,080
If you say save it instead of playing it first and something happens with your network connection,

610
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
I get how it's told on people.

611
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
You know, I don't mind listening to Angie again to you.

612
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,080
Other day, the live feed and...

613
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Gosh, you are such a charming devil.

614
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,080
Hmm.

615
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
Couldn't take my eyes away from you, baby.

616
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,080
Oh, baby.

617
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
Oh, man.

618
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
I'm so behind on everything.

619
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,080
I know I haven't talked to you in forever.

620
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,080
And I feel so bad.

621
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,080
So this was like a really great excuse to give you a buzz.

622
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
I'm actually...

623
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,080
I've been going insane because getting ready to put out Los Balls third CD.

624
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,080
And it looks like I got everything together.

625
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,080
And we're on track to have some advanced copies at the new media expo.

626
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,080
In Ontario, later this month.

627
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,080
Yeah.

628
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,080
And I was thinking, I wish you would make good on your little promise to come and give me a hug.

629
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,080
It would be so awesome.

630
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,080
Oh, boy.

631
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,080
You know, me and the other girls are going to be there at the awards ceremony to pick up our...

632
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,080
You know, podcast award with who my first.

633
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,080
And if you saw awesome to see you there.

634
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,080
And we're actually trying to get together like a little meat and greet afterwards.

635
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,080
So we can meet the fans and everybody right after the award ceremony.

636
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,080
So I'll let you know if we get that together.

637
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,080
And it will be awesome if you can make an appearance.

638
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
Anyways.

639
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,080
Hope and see you later this month.

640
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Bye, baby.

641
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
Oh, baby.

642
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
Yeah, so here's what's going on.

643
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,080
I have to be in Chicago on September, I think, 26th.

644
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:19,080
Now, it would be reasonably easy, I think, to hop from Chicago to Ontario, California

645
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,080
for the 27th.

646
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
At least the 27th.

647
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,080
I don't know if I can do the 28th.

648
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,080
It's 27th to 28th is PME, right?

649
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,080
And I really want to go because I want that hug.

650
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,080
That's what I want.

651
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,080
You and the girl is going to be there and we could have such a good time.

652
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,080
And then I have to fly back like a crazy MF bad out of hell.

653
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
Excuse me.

654
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:48,080
Because we have the digital musical awards happening October 2nd in London at the roundhouse.

655
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
And it's a funky show.

656
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,080
You know, British telecom are part and over here sponsors the show.

657
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,080
And so we set up a whole party, party palace basically downstairs.

658
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,080
And we got the free open bar.

659
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,080
So guess where all the bands in the artists are hanging out after they pick up their awards.

660
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
Uh-huh.

661
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,080
Near the bar.

662
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
You know it.

663
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
That's good.

664
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
It's going to be cool.

665
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
We got all of our UK talent.

666
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
We'll be representing, I think.

667
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
And that'll go County from Textra is in town anyway.

668
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,080
So she's extending her stay to do a couple things.

669
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,080
And this will be in a way kind of a, I guess a soft launch of the plus TV,

670
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,080
which if you haven't seen it, check out the plus tv.com.

671
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,080
This is, this is a project that we've been working on for quite a while.

672
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,080
It's essentially, it's a, it's a video channel of, of crazy shit.

673
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,080
The whole idea is, what if, if MTV hadn't gone to long-form programming?

674
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,080
What if it had stayed with music videos and crazy shit?

675
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,080
And that's basically what we're trying to implement.

676
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,080
The plus tv.com.

677
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,080
And so we'll be live from the digital musical awards on October 2nd,

678
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,080
with live updates coming directly from the red carpet,

679
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,080
from behind the, you know, backstage, essentially behind the scenes,

680
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,080
and at our open bar extravaganza.

681
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
So it should be fun.

682
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,080
So it is very possible that we can connect for that hug, my dear.

683
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
Fantastic.

684
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,080
With Adam Curry.

685
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,080
Adam, are you ready to be stumped?

686
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
Mr. Friday.

687
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,080
Use the makeup on Mondays.

688
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
With young problem.

689
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Hey, Adam, this is hit this number 87.

690
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
And again, we're going to start right away.

691
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,080
So here we go with the drone.

692
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
No one.

693
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,080
That's, uh, I'm, I'm going to guess, uh, you got me hanging it loose ends hanging on a string.

694
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
I think something like that.

695
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,080
And this is number two.

696
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,080
All right, y'all, you got me stumped on that one, buddy.

697
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,080
I have no idea what that is.

698
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
And the final one is number three.

699
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
Oh, yeah.

700
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue.

701
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Oh, I can't remember.

702
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Oh, y'all, you're killing me.

703
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
And times up.

704
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
And these are the answers.

705
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,080
This is from 1981.

706
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
Y'all, bro.

707
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Y'all, bro.

708
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,080
People.

709
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
And don't stop the music.

710
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
Oh, y'all.

711
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
You're ready.

712
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,080
Watch all you've got me messed up.

713
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,080
With the beat.

714
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,080
I'm always mad aside.

715
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,080
I'll keep stopping.

716
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,080
I'll keep stopping.

717
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Yes, really watch that.

718
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Oh, don't stop the music.

719
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
It's answer number one.

720
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Oh, is this one?

721
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,080
And this is answer number two.

722
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
The hell is this?

723
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Oh, the pleasure prince.

724
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Oh, man.

725
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,080
From 1987, it's Gena Jackson.

726
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
Oh, suck.

727
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
I can't believe.

728
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Did you get it at home?

729
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
No.

730
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,080
Did you get your budget in your ears?

731
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,080
The pleasure prince of all has a number two.

732
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
And this is also from 1987.

733
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
Number three.

734
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,080
Get down on it.

735
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Oh, so nice.

736
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
Oh, yeah.

737
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
Oh, no.

738
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
Got me.

739
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
Got me.

740
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,080
Got me.

741
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Just do it to me.

742
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,080
And Spania and call me as answer number three.

743
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,080
And that concludes this week's hit test.

744
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
And it's number 78.

745
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
Nice.

746
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Nobody.

747
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Well, it's about it for this week.

748
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Thanks for playing Adam.

749
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
Yeah, the mall.

750
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
No.

751
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
I had none of them.

752
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:09,080
Very ready, and answers and of course the iTunes links can be found at this dot

753
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,080
bar'sshell.com.

754
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
So thanks again until next week.

755
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
Take care.

756
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Bye-bye.

757
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,080
To test that gmail.com

758
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
hwnpul.com

759
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,080
and p-o-l-g-t- the-o

760
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
It's such a wall of sound.

761
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
You know, when Phil Spector goes to jail,

762
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
we're not pretty sure he will.

763
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,440
beyond you can slip right in with a new wall of sound.

764
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,160
That's for sure.

765
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,080
I didn't get a single one right.

766
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,840
Slow moving on a Monday here in the manner.

767
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,680
Bad times.

768
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,920
Right, so we implemented a few new things.

769
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,400
This past week, it was good to hook up with all the

770
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,800
geekyzoids in the back, all the engineers.

771
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,200
Oh, we got some great new cheddar functionality coming for the

772
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
channel editor.

773
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,400
You'll be able to get channels now and put channels into channels.

774
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,200
That's all on the way.

775
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,400
Dutches doing that for us.

776
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,600
Andrew and Paulina have been working on the new search, which is now live.

777
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,800
It's not perfect yet, but they called in.

778
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,800
And you remember, well, of course, we know Andrew Grummit.

779
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,600
And then you have Paulina who is just about the sexiest voice.

780
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,200
And she's going to tell us, it's too bad Andrew is talking.

781
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,400
And it just close your eyes and envision Andrew in his jammies.

782
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,800
Paulina in her 90, given you an update about Pacho search.

783
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,200
Hey, Adam, it's Andrew.

784
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And joining me is Paulina.

785
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,400
Hello, we're just checking in from HQ to give you an update on a new

786
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:55,000
feature that went live Monday evening, actually, but drum roll.

787
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
It is it's search.

788
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
So we've we've updated the site.

789
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,800
Yes, yes, we are.

790
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,200
We have updated the search both actually the back and front ends of the search.

791
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,600
It's a brand new platform.

792
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,800
And it's it's amazing.

793
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,200
It's well, it will be.

794
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:22,000
It's got the the really neat thing is that it it transcribes

795
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,400
all the podcasts and figures out the language for you.

796
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,200
So let's say that you're, you know, lying around at home.

797
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Having a glass of scotch.

798
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,000
That happens regularly.

799
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,600
Who's doing a podcast on gay porn talk?

800
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,200
Right.

801
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,200
Oh my god, there's one in Africa.

802
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,400
Gay porn talk.

803
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,200
Yes, you'll see that there's this, you know, when you search on shows,

804
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,800
there's this whole refined by category column on the left.

805
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,800
And the, so the language is just one of many sections.

806
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,200
And the language is actually surfaced at the bottom.

807
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But you can also refine your searches by categories or tags or rating,

808
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,800
which is in the form.

809
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:10,800
Yeah, it's funny.

810
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,400
I got a couple emails from people saying that that they tried the new search.

811
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,600
But for some reason, there's a banner on the right hand side that pushes

812
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,600
all the search results to the bottom or something.

813
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,400
If you have having problems with that, let me know.

814
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm still trying to figure out what's going on.

815
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,200
I'm not seeing that here.

816
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,600
But it is pretty cool that, you know, we've kind of got the basics now covered.

817
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,600
Where we're also doing a search based upon the transcript of the individual show.

818
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,800
Yeah, format video or audio.

819
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,800
And the ratings is it's actually just kind of a rebranded iTunes explicit tag

820
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
that would be more familiar to your, I guess, average TV audience.

821
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,400
Um, what are we calling them?

822
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
We're friendly.

823
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,800
That left hand now.

824
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
We had a name for it.

825
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,800
Cluster.

826
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,600
Ah, yes.

827
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,000
Right.

828
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,400
So, so those things are actually populated by the larger, you know, you cluster me.

829
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,600
10 or 15,000 results.

830
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,600
And, um, and that those lists on the left are actually sort of, you know,

831
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,600
if you want to subdivide your results, those lists are categorized by the larger are

832
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
calculated from the larger results set.

833
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:24,600
And we have another view, um, we have the list view, which just gives you a quick hit.

834
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,800
Yeah, that's really nice.

835
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Now you have different views list view.

836
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,600
You're going to see a lot of this come back in the new interface when we launch

837
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,600
that end of November, uh, beginning of December.

838
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,400
Oh, we have so much cool shit to show you.

839
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,000
Also, the episode matching is very cool.

840
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,600
Actually, that's really powerful.

841
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,000
I think.

842
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,600
Yeah, so let's go into those one at a time for a second.

843
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,400
In reverse order.

844
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,600
So if you're the default view in our, in our search results is, um, what we call the detail view.

845
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,600
And so for each row, you see some album art and a list of categories and a lot of descriptive information.

846
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,600
Nice big fat rows for each search result.

847
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,400
And, um, we, uh, we're actually doing something kind of interesting.

848
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,600
We're searching not just the shows, but the episodes also.

849
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,600
The UI around this is little rough.

850
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Some people may not immediately grok to it.

851
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Um, but in any case, if you, if you do a search on a word,

852
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:25,600
and the result doesn't contain that word in the show title, just direct your eyes over to the right.

853
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
And you'll see a section called Episode Matches.

854
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:33,600
And it may be that, uh, the match for your term actually is over in one of the episodes.

855
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,600
So that's pretty cool.

856
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Um, what was the other one, Paulina?

857
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Uh, I think so, uh, the list view is the other one.

858
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,600
It's not you, uh, yeah, tell me how to get there and what's going on in there.

859
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:50,600
So there's an icon on your right right below the page and that you can just, and it's,

860
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:56,600
a little spew. And basically, it just, it gives you all the shows,

861
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,600
and none of the fluff.

862
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
Get right to the shows that all the shows.

863
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,600
No, no, no, no, no, no more on the page.

864
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,600
I think something like 25, a little bit of info.

865
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,600
Something like 25 hits per page instead of 10.

866
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Yes, no, 25, right?

867
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,600
I think if you hover over those little icons at the upper end.

868
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,600
To the tip, next to search view, it actually has a little tool tip.

869
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,600
Mm-hmm.

870
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,600
Tell you, you know, what our names for these things are.

871
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
And so we're still refining it.

872
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,600
Currently, it's only, you can only search shows with this new engine.

873
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:34,600
But very soon, you'll be able to search our entire catalog.

874
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,600
Yeah, so this is just the first, you have some baby steps.

875
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,600
Let's just show us first, right?

876
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,600
Pretty exciting stuff.

877
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,600
We have coming down the line.

878
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:50,600
So we wanted to thank everybody for checking this out and give a couple of shout outs to our team.

879
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,600
Yeah, we have a Devon, Jeff, Michael, Tom, Jacquesite,

880
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:04,600
Vaishali, Shrikant, and our contact over at the search engine company calm.

881
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
So, all right.

882
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
Thank you for everyone's attention.

883
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,600
I hope everybody enjoys it.

884
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,600
We'll be listening for feedback.

885
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
And I think that's it for now.

886
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
All right.

887
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Good night.

888
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,600
Mm-hmm.

889
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,600
You know, these guys recorded this on cast blaster.

890
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,600
And that'll leave a temp file if something goes wrong.

891
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,600
So, we're going to find a little outtake from Paulina, listen to this.

892
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Oh, wait a minute.

893
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
A second.

894
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,600
I got to load it up like this here.

895
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,600
This isn't outtake from that recording.

896
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Ah.

897
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,600
Beautiful.

898
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,600
Andrew and his jammy's Paulina in her 90.

899
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,600
Ah, yes.

900
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,600
It's the gang from HQ.

901
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,600
What a bummer now.

902
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,600
The gang at the office.

903
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,600
But a bum just saying hello.

904
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,600
But a bum to the gang from HQ.

905
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,600
But a bum to the gang.

906
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,600
And I'd show.

907
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,600
Jesus.

908
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
With me.

909
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,600
Come on.

910
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Hi, Adam.

911
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
It's Matt from Games Resil.

912
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,600
On this week's show, we're reviewing Tigerwood's PGA208 on the Xbox 360.

913
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,600
We jump out of an hour plane with a new Medal of Honor game.

914
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,600
We also go behind the scenes with a team at LucasArts.

915
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,600
So, look at their brand new game Star Wars, The Force, and Least.

916
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,600
And you can win copies of Alien Syndrome for the PSP.

917
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,600
Check it out.

918
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Gamesweasel.com.

919
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,600
Hey, Adam.

920
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
It's Jay Mac from TheHootHeight.com show.

921
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,600
I'm hoping this gets to you before the recording of Who Our Friday begins.

922
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,600
Oops.

923
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,600
I just want to drop a message with you and let you know that we actually were selected

924
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,600
is one of the best underground hip-hop sites by VH1 hip-hop honors,

925
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,600
which is a huge thing for us.

926
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,600
And they're actually, they got us up against four other websites.

927
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:10,600
And people can go and actually vote on what the best underground hip-hop site is.

928
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,600
We don't know if we win anything just to say that we won for the VH1 hip-hop honors.

929
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,600
It would be just a huge, huge deal and a really good look for podcasting as a whole

930
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,600
because we are the only podcasting site up there at any of the categories being voted on.

931
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:31,600
So, if you could, I'd really appreciate it if the listeners who are going to help us

932
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,600
reach that number one spot.

933
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:40,600
Go to www.hoodide.com and there's a graphic on the front page on the right side

934
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,600
that says VH1 hip-hop honors.

935
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,600
Just click that graphic.

936
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,600
It's two clicks, no registering or anything like that.

937
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,600
Two quick clicks to vote for us.

938
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,600
We'd really, really appreciate it.

939
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,600
It'd be huge for us.

940
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,600
We'd be huge for podcasting.

941
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,600
Thanks so much for your time and talk to you soon.

942
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,600
Yeah, and on a problem, do.

943
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,600
Happy to comply.

944
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,600
I love that show,hoodide.com.

945
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,600
It's been around for a long time too, a couple of years, fantastic.

946
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,600
So, let's see.

947
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,600
We got lots of stuff happening here in the UK.

948
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,600
This week is going to be very busy.

949
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,600
Although I've tried to work in some morning times, so I'll be able to do some shows.

950
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Thursday probably will be messed up.

951
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,600
Friday, not sure, may have to go to Germany.

952
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,600
You know, that's the way it goes.

953
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,600
As I said, up until the end of this year, it's going to be nuts completely, completely out of control.

954
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,600
Ron's coming.

955
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,600
Wednesday morning, we got some meetings at BT.

956
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,600
It's just going to be crazy.

957
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,600
And then, so Patricia and I have, so I got a meeting.

958
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,600
Today at the office, Patricia is going to come with me because we have some kind of social

959
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,600
function tonight.

960
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,600
We're going to.

961
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,600
So busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, but enjoying it.

962
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
Hey, Adam.

963
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,600
It's Jimmy Lee from many, ready to do that.

964
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,600
Just listening to Delhi, source code, six, six, two.

965
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:59,600
The young folks, dude, I heard it on clear channel station here in the US just a few days ago.

966
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,600
That's just totally amazing.

967
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,600
I mean, the pod show network.

968
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,600
I think has much more impact in reach.

969
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,600
And I hear you're coming up on the DSC666.

970
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,600
Yeah.

971
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,600
Can we expect to hear from you?

972
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
Or just another test test.

973
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,600
Test type show.

974
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,600
You wore the evil spirits off.

975
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,600
Anyway, take care of Adam.

976
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,600
Catch you later.

977
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,600
Yeah.

978
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,600
People haven't been standing me stuff for 666.

979
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,600
Feel free to send more because I'll gladly roll it all out.

980
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,600
Lots of deals above and loose it for stuff.

981
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,600
A lot of fun though.

982
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,600
So send that on in.

983
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,600
Yeah, man.

984
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,600
It's working.

985
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,600
This pod safe music network.

986
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:42,600
And by the way, it's the pod safe, not pod show music network, pod safe music network.

987
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,600
A comic strip blogger continues to call bullshit on that.

988
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,600
So it's not independent.

989
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,600
Fuck you, comic strip blogger.

990
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,600
And send it a comment.

991
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,600
Will you?

992
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,600
Because your jingles get an old crusty and old.

993
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,600
So along those lines, this is from John from photo walkthrough.com.

994
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,600
He said, give these guys a show, a showing on the DSC.

995
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,600
He asked the bar.

996
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,600
If you believe it, say it loud.

997
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,600
