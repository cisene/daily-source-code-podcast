1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And now, deep inside the curry manner, the DSC-536, with the master of the manner, Adam Curley.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I think in a different day that's all we do.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's all I do, everything must come and go.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There's nothing left in doing spells.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
When life and love is all we've got.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
With the memories time forgotten, I'm trying not to hear the cries.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Of all these broken hearts tonight, that's all I need.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're all I need.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You make me feel, you make me feel so high.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Like life and love and everything is gonna be all right.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And you make me feel, you make me feel all right.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And I'm never gonna have to be lonely again.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And tonight is just a dream, a mental version of ecstasy.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
To complicated and cloud the mind.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Keeping everything in life, I close my eyes and fade to black.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Try to let my head relax, that's all I do.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You know that's all I do, take some time to breathe again.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And you're getting everything in, at least that's what I'm gonna do.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Be sure to be on over you.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I've got the thought in some of my, I'll bring you different times.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's all I need.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're all I need.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You make me feel, you make me feel so high.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Like life and love and everything is gonna be all right.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And you make me feel, you make me feel all right.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And I'm never gonna have to be alone again.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And I, I, I, I, I, I.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You make me feel, you make me feel so high.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Like life and love and everything is gonna be all right.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And you make me feel, you make me feel all right.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I'm never gonna have to be alone again at night.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You make me feel, you make me feel so high.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Like life and love and everything is gonna be all right.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And you make the feel

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,500
You make the feel so light

39
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
That never gonna happen to me alone

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
In our new night

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
From Pennsylvania, Rise Phoenix Rise

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Boxing Josh

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
From the pod save music network

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Not to go to mall

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Welcome to the daily source code

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What was that?

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Little burp there at the end

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Episode number 536

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
During that song

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I realized that I

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
hadn't converted the phone messages

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It came in today

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm like, it's interesting

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm looking at my castblaster play

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And I'm thinking of myself

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm missing stuff

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It doesn't seem like I have enough stuff

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Loaded up

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So while in the last 30 seconds of the song

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And as we speak right now

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I mean this setup is so fantastic

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That I've built here up in Adam's attic

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That I could even do my nails

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll bring you the show

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You may hear some banging

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Throughout the show

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The sky man is here

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Nice guy, by the way

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
David, David the sky man

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, really, really proper

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's like, do you mind if I smoke while I'm

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, I'm outside

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Because he has to put the dish up first

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm like, um, do you mind if I smoke inside

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Well, you're putting the dish up

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So he got a lot of work to do

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Because we got three

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's like the multi-room view

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So I finally want to do it right

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Give Christina her own skybox in a room

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
One for the masturbate room

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes, you heard properly

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And of course the HD

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Or is that Britsa the HD

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
HD

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
HD

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
For the viewing room

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Which is going to be so freaking awesome

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Once it's done

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And of course I'm being nice to the guy

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Because my HD hasn't actually arrived yet

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I got a whole bunch of warnings from people yesterday

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
They said, you know, oh dude

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If you don't have your HD system there

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
They won't actually install

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So I think I've got them fooled

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I think it'll work out

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Hey, lots of stuff to talk about today

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Of course an update on free Trinity

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Had some great conversations yesterday

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And let me see

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hop- Hop- Hop- Hop- Hop- Hop- Hop- What should we do first?

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, uh, P-Dub

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I mean

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How can I be so silly

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I mean

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's been a while since you sent something

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, you know, he can answer all your questions

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So all of your problems too

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's P-Dub

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Sound library pair man

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Coming after you

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Sound library pair man

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's he gonna do

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He'll fix your misconceptions

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And answer questions too

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Turn nothing in the universe

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And you can't be free

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sound library pair man

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What?

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Sound library pair man

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Get lost

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Everybody

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yo, Adam, P-Dub

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So, oh wow

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Your UK listeners question about upper class

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Trashing of restrooms

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Really struck home

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
When I was playing with my band

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I had a regular weekly gig

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
A pub that catered to people who spent more for one beer

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Than average folk spent for two six packs

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
After we set up all the equipment on the stage

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I would go to the men's room

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
To wash up and change into my stage clothes

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I was one of those people who believed that if you're being paid to perform

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Well, you ought to be dressed

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Of course

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Better than if you were doing yard work

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I agree

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The bathroom was always clean and tidy

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
However

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
When we finished our last set at 3am

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Those nice clothes I had put on

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We're usually soaked in sweat

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So I usually wanted to change back

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Into my dry jeans and teach it

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So I would head back to the men's room

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It was usually destroyed

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The floor would be covered with paper towels

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
toilet paper

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Water from the urinals

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Which were overflowing because they were so full of gum

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If you missed yesterday's show

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This isn't response to the question

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Our posh people pigs

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Guy who works at a...

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Was it a law firm?

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A lot of really wealthy

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So-called sophisticated posh people

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He said that the lavatories are just an absolute pigsty

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And so his question was

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Our posh people pigs

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is what PW was responding to

168
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Big reds and trash

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The toilet seats covered with vomit

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Or worse than that

171
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
To Spencer's were

172
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Brought out

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's worse than vomit

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh

175
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What's worse than vomit

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll take shit over vomit

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Getting pulled off the wall

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Mirror's busted

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It actually looked like it was purposefully trashed

180
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Now I'm certain that if I followed any one of the patrons in this pub home

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Their own bathrooms would be spotless

182
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Most upper middle class homes are

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
They think that it says that given an element of anonymity

184
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Even the most educated and well-off person

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Will reveal that they really don't give a shit about anyone else

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Add the element of alcohol

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And they become bold enough to demonstrate that rather deliberately

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I

189
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I once taped a note up over urinal in the men's room where I worked

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
For the British listeners that would be a urinal

191
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It said, hey asshole

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Your gum doesn't go away by itself

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Some poor slob has to fish it out with their hands every day

194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You don't realize that

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
A few hours later when I went back to the men's room

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Someone had written on my note

197
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Glad it ain't me

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And stuck a lot of gum to the wall

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Next to the note

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I believe that your real character is revealed by what you do

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
When nobody can see you do it

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Good or bad

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And right on PW

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I have to say I'm done without analysis

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And I think that there isn't added

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I think it is a maybe a middle-class problem

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You know not quite high up enough on the food chain to be

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You know to have servants

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But to feel like whoever is cleaning this bathroom is your servant

210
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I think that's what it is

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I personally never

212
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Never ever ever

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But maybe that's also because I've had businesses with bathrooms

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And it's very important to have a clean bathroom in your business

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And I watch that shit

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm not the shit

217
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But I watch that there's no shit

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And when else got any experiences with that

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Would love to hear from you about that

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Comic strip

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Comic strip

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Comic strip

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Comic strip

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I think I'm actually getting closer to working this out with CSB

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You know I said that I would be willing to work it out with them

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And see if we can figure out a date and here we go

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hello Mr. Kerry

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Without your blackberry

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So maybe I will read email that I have just written to you

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So that in case you would like to play it on the seat that you could play it

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
When it comes to me you don't have to play it

232
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So I read I'm reading

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Higher Adam

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I am a bald

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Said pasta

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Who weighs at least two times as you being on the five feet and low

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So you made this like seeing me in person

238
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But good interview can be only in person

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So I really want to do it in person

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Regarding times

241
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Between 12 and 16th February

242
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I will be in Barcelona at 3GSM

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The biggest conference about mobile phone industry in Universe

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I also have other commitments

245
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So before 3GSM

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I can come to London only

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Following days of February

248
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The following days of February

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Says Saturday

250
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Fourth Sunday

251
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
9th Friday

252
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
10th Saturday

253
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Please pick one of these dates and tell me three days in advance or earlier

254
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I will come

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Otherwise please propose some time after 3GSM

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah

257
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Don't you love it when I do my scheduling

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Through the podcast?

259
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Isn't that incredibly interesting?

260
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
All right, comments or blogger?

261
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Can we do it like Monday or Tuesday of next week?

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I know you're available this weekend but I really want to be home this week

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't want to go into the city

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So I can just stay home and maybe do a Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I can coordinate that with the trip to the shortage office

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Today there are actually tapings

267
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Crap, I didn't know that it would do it today

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Or we could have maybe hooked up today

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Anyway, and then I have another question

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Can I do some video of the two of us?

271
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Were you interviewed me?

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I know there's lots of people who would love to see this short

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Fat bald guy is that what you said you were?

274
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I think it would be interesting

275
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So let me know

276
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Patricia and I just got back from

277
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
From buying a car actually

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
She's been complaining about the

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
About the Super V8

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Because it's big

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's like she didn't remember

282
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It could be any car we wanted

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
As long as it said jaguar on it

284
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And I went for the turbo diesel

285
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And like cool you know what put some biodiesel in it

286
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And she's like, ah, it's small and it doesn't feel like a real car

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And guys you've heard this before

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
From your women

289
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Boy how sexist was that

290
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah, showing you know it's like

291
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Ah, it's too big and I can't fit it anywhere

292
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And I have to admit it

293
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Thank God for the parking sensors

294
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm pretty good with those

295
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I can zip it right anywhere

296
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But still it's a big car

297
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So she wanted something small

298
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I've been looking around

299
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And I saw at a

300
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
A garage that I've been driving by for the past two years

301
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
When we were at the cottage

302
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Of course we're at the manner now

303
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's sticking the curry manner

304
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I drove by this place for two years

305
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And the guy sells all kinds of interesting cars

306
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's not like a separate dealership

307
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He does seem to sell a lot of smart cars

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If you've never seen the smart car

309
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I had one in Amsterdam

310
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I love them to death

311
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And I saw today as I was driving past

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I happened to be in that neighborhood

313
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I saw a smart roadster

314
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Pitch black

315
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Really interesting to look at

316
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And so yeah, it stopped that check that out

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What an amazing car

318
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's I mean if you're familiar with the smart

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Then it basically has the same mechanics as the smart

320
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Only it looks very smart

321
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It looks really cute

322
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Very sporty

323
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's a two-seater

324
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It has an electric roof

325
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That you can actually open while in flight

326
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
As I say

327
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Or while you're driving

328
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Has air conditioning

329
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It has CD player

330
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It has heated seats

331
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's really a nice sporty little vehicle

332
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And so I took Patricia over

333
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And she did a test drive

334
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But she loves it

335
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So

336
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We are now owners of a smart roadster

337
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It'll be here next week sometime

338
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So now I'm actually considering

339
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Trading in the

340
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Super V8 for something

341
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
A little bit smaller

342
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's just ridiculous

343
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You know we've got this circuit

344
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Like an S shape drive way now

345
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Which has really high walls

346
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's kind of hard to explain

347
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I should do some video of the place

348
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I have promised people pictures and video

349
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But when you see it it's kind of like

350
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay, I am now on a Bob's sled track

351
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And I'm trying to make my way down

352
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I also wouldn't mind getting an all-wheel drive vehicle

353
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And so I saw a was an X type

354
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Which is a significantly

355
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
cheaper model

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Just you know and it's much more

357
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Ford pieces on there if you will

358
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Which I really dislike

359
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But it was an all-wheel drive

360
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It was pretty tricked out

361
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Low profile wheels

362
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Maybe just a much more sensible car

363
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I got to look at that

364
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I mean I'm happy with the jack

365
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And of course Trinity is a gear and up

366
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I got to get a new wheels in San Francisco as well

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And of course you cannot for the life of you

368
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
By a

369
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Diesel engine in the state of California

370
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Car with a diesel engine

371
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That sounds pretty stupid to me for you know

372
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What is the deal with that?

373
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Why can't you buy a diesel engine in California

374
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's supposed to be a

375
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Fantastic

376
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Fantastic

377
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's supposed to be great

378
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's particularly with biodiesel in it

379
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Hey before I forget I want to say congratulations to Don and Drew

380
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
500 shows

381
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Kids

382
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I remember it like yesterday

383
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Insert

384
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Rewind music here

385
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, it's right. They're about to do their show number 500

386
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
God

387
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And Don is doing this advice show

388
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Is it advice with Don dot pot show dot com I think it is?

389
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Oh man, it's fantastic

390
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You should hear

391
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You should hear the one about

392
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Well, I'm not going to tell you you have to go listen to that show

393
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They've come a long way

394
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I think one of the first podcasters to quit their day job do it full time

395
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And then I'm doing video

396
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And the the sky seems to be the limit with these kids

397
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I love you so much

398
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I wish I got more sexy pictures from Don

399
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
She used to send him to me

400
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't get there anymore that much

401
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's see what came in on the voice mail lines

402
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I asked my listeners from down under

403
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The guys who are working at the help desk

404
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What exactly they did

405
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And well the conversation works

406
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
They're going to have a look Scott from shit here again

407
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This one's written there that the help desk that we work in

408
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Is an internet related help desk

409
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We actually do support for

410
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Ideas so boil up

411
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Satellite radio services things of that nature

412
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So these are the guys that when your ADSL is not working you got to call them

413
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But we all get you sit around in the morning when the

414
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Value source code comes in

415
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And sit there for

416
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The 40 minutes of your show and then you have a minute of it

417
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's when when you call in and your DSL isn't working that's when you hear the

418
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The current wait time is

419
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
40 minutes

420
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
In the cool music that you play in the rock

421
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So yeah, it's like some hard rock for a stay at him

422
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And yeah, we're looking forward to hearing you

423
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The value source code is another thing you used to come

424
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Perhaps you could be around for every day

425
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So yeah, thanks a lot Adam

426
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
All right, I'm man, thanks for calling in and let me know what it's all about

427
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Were you guys what you guys are doing

428
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And that's really nice, you know that I don't know how many of the of there of there are how many of

429
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,720
There are you how many there are of you how many guys. Oh, see you squirrel

430
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Haven't seen the squirrel in a long time. We're glad this place is fantastic

431
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I can't wait until the spring and summer. We got a beautiful day today by the way blue skies

432
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,280
Temperature around 13 14 degrees sun is shining really really nice

433
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:39,000
Was I saying yeah, it's interesting that that you guys are all listening together. Are there any other offices out there that listen to the show together

434
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You know, we can do some fun stuff

435
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Yeah, we can

436
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Yeah, I'm the radio that used to be

437
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,840
All kinds of programs typically between 10 and 10 a.m. and noon and

438
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:58,440
And then you could call up and congratulate someone they turn the radio up or you could make your boss the boss of the week. Oh, there you go

439
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,280
Let's make let's make your boss the boss of the week. That could be fun

440
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,960
Where you call in with the with a

441
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,080
It just calling to the voice mail lines or even better if you want to send me an audio

442
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,640
Comment through email. That's probably even better

443
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,800
And you know, you tell me why your boss should be boss of the week boss of the day or

444
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Boss of the of the universe, whatever

445
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You know how to do it

446
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Yep, or Adam at podshow.com

447
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,480
You know you guys are getting really good at at feeding back about stuff that's going on in problems and

448
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,800
You know once in a while you just don't quite give me all the data like you know a

449
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:58,680
Soren went missing on the pod save music network or I can't play it. You know, well, until you need to give me a little more information and tell me exactly what

450
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,040
But the thing is you're calling in at least you're telling me the things aren't working

451
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,480
Here's another example

452
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,120
Be a Adam curry. This is Martin from the Netherlands

453
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,120
I've enjoyed listening to your source code very much

454
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,640
But lately I haven't been able to listen in very much because every time I try to

455
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,720
Play the daily source code on my pub player. It gives me a form of error

456
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:31,320
This is an item so much that I've been trying to find out where the problems started occurring and I found out that it was introduced

457
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,080
at daily source code number 482

458
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,720
So strangely all the daily source codes up and

459
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
an including

460
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,480
481 work perfectly and

461
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:53,160
Starting at steady source code 482 they stop working that was the 20th of October last year

462
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,880
Goodbye

463
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,880
So that that my friends is almost a perfect report

464
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,520
Because now I can go back we can go back and look at all the logs see if anything change

465
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,520
Maybe there was a de-gap change

466
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Maybe there was a new version of cast blaster it could be a million different things that are going on

467
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,360
So thank you very much that helps the only other thing that would have been great is to know exactly what type of player you're using because

468
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,040
You're the it's so far the only report I've received so it may be a player issue somehow

469
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
You know these things can be pretty weird

470
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
But as I said I appreciate it

471
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
You know what the music means don't you

472
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,320
Time to clean out those pipes and sing along because we're about to free Trinity

473
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
USA

474
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
Open and make a good time today

475
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:51,000
I feel that I better watch you go letting everybody know that this is gonna be the better way

476
00:21:52,040 --> 00:22:01,240
One three Trinity Trinity the quintessential luxury Trinity let the bio diesel set you bring

477
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,720
Trinity Trinity all right free Trinity we're about to send this

478
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,520
Child who covered

479
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:16,040
Child who colored Mercedes 300 turbo diesel station wagon from 1984 fueled entirely by bio diesel

480
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,480
On the west coast of the east coast of the United States and if we're lucky even beyond that yes today

481
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,520
KJ and I KJ being our head sales we saw we had a great conference call with the folks at Nokia Nokia

482
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,600
So yeah, how do you actually pronounce that is there correct?

483
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,240
Not correct pronunciation. I just say Nokia, but maybe it's a Nokia

484
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,840
A Jeff thanks man. I really appreciate the long Trinity song too, by the way, it makes a lot more fun

485
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
They are very interested to say the least

486
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Which is good news

487
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,840
So we're working on the on the technology and and on the sponsorship

488
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:04,920
But yeah, it's not stopping this from from moving on and fact as I go into the into the Gmail here. Let me just see what we've

489
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Okay, so the first thing is

490
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,720
There is a Google group now

491
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:18,680
Free Trinity save the world when viable prizes of course. I will put a link in the show notes a daily source code.com

492
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,080
So now we have a nail list and we can start communicating

493
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,560
Offline for the show, but online obviously through Google groups and now we can get some stuff set up

494
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
Who did that for me

495
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,920
Was that

496
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,600
Pop podcaster

497
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,080
Apollo Alto podcaster? Yeah, that's who did it exactly

498
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,280
Dude, thank you very much. That's a good start

499
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,080
What is this?

500
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,560
This is from from the Apollo Alto podcast. Adam. I was just catching up with the recent episodes data source code totally on board with the free Trinity campaign

501
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,720
Of course my first thought was how can I tie this in with my podcast? But after hearing Jeff Smith's theme song and all the ideas about the road trip

502
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,040
Caravan. I'm not thinking about my show anymore. I'm thinking oh my god. This could be so cool

503
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,040
By the way, on the project planner info management person will be happy to get things rolling. You see this is the stuff that I love now

504
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
I've had several offers

505
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
I know new

506
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:23,240
Was it new forward? I think from the UK also offered but you know to have someone actually in in the US and Apollo Alto

507
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
I presume you're in Apollo Alto

508
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,800
And oh it's Barbara. She's female too. Oh man

509
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,920
So then there's it would be great if Trinity could make her road show debut at the biodiesel conference

510
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,640
I'm sure she would be the bell of the ball plus there are hundreds of exhibitors signed up

511
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,520
Okay, so I'm I'm liking what I'm seeing here Barbara. I really appreciate you set up the google groups and let's let's open up this dialogue

512
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
Let's get it going. I would love to engage you

513
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
to help us out

514
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,720
And if you hadn't seen curry dot com I posted a video there or a link to a Jeff Smith's

515
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,280
Was it what's your show? It's Jeff Smith's day job and

516
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,560
And he he drove Trinity's sister unity and it's interesting you see him driving to what would be

517
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,520
Go from like to Louisiana I think and he had some significant trip to do and he

518
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,000
You know it stops off get some biodiesel on the way talks to people and that eats a sandwich

519
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,280
You know all the typical cool stuff we do and it's very entertaining podcast and you know that

520
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,880
That Jeff's gonna be a part of this so he's talking about the bio summit in Texas

521
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,480
That's a lot of stuff going on the Trinity needs to visit. This is why we need this frapper map set up tell on you

522
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:45,560
An Alex Fennie Fennie Vessie Fennie Vessie. I'm just guessing here. I think it's Alex Fennie Vessie

523
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,920
Has come up with some lyrics to yet another Trinity song. I Adam this is fugly Jay from the big ugly podcast

524
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,040
Hopefully this message hasn't found its way to you too late yet

525
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,560
I was just catching up on the DSC. I have a feeling this is not Alex so this is fugly Jay

526
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,280
Let's listen to him. I'll look for Alex this thing because that was pretty cool too

527
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,520
Monday afternoon

528
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:16,440
When I heard about the possible giveaway of Trinity the spring I was planning on doing a documentary style

529
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,520
podcast on

530
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,520
biodiesel and alternative fuels

531
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:27,160
My plan was to talk to automotive engineers mechanics lawyers tax attorneys in the like

532
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Just to get a rundown on what the average consumer should expect if he decides to make the switch to bio fuels

533
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,560
As part of the project I was also planning on buying a diesel truck and

534
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,800
Setting it up for biodiesel or possibly straight vegetable oil

535
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,840
Since then however financial considerations of force me to put the project on hold

536
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,160
But it seems to me

537
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,360
Trinity would be

538
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,520
Perfect for this kind of project and it would be driven daily

539
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,560
Given my day job is a pizza delivery driver

540
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,560
So I just thought I'd throw that out there

541
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:09,800
Thanks for listening and you can find me at big ugly dot pod show dot com. All right, man. Thank you. Okay, so I don't know what happened there. I I lost

542
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,120
Lost Alex's little song lyrics there crap. All right

543
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,160
Well

544
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:25,640
I'll look for that tomorrow then for you. Oh shit and while I was talking we went right through we blasted through the freaking satellite window

545
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,680
Whoops, sorry about that Peter

546
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,360
Hi Adam Franco here. Let me tell you. I'm 100% into this free Trinity thing

547
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:41,880
Here in Italy use and production of biodiesel is severely limited by low so if you need someone driving across Italy

548
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,840
Getting speed tickets while running on illegal fuel. Well. I'm your man. Okay, stay cool up there in the

549
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,080
Curricatta comms

550
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:59,400
Pronto ciao Franco. All right, man. Excellent. Hey Franco. We're still working on that localization for Italy though as I promised all right

551
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,840
So it looks like

552
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,560
We are rolling again check the show notes for links to the to the Google group

553
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
So that we can communicate about this in

554
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,560
In some form of structured manner and I'll see if I can get in touch with barbersee if she can help us out

555
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,640
We get this thing rolling again. All I really need is a frapper map. I know exactly what I need

556
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,400
Where the mash up master is listening to the daily source code, huh?

557
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,080

565
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:21,080
To be loved, there's to be strong girl

566
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,080
You can laugh away the pain

567
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Light again the listen to the song

568
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,080
Praise sound, it's like a lullaby

569
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,080
Believe it or just leave it

570
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,080
But you don't know until you feel it

571
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,080
Oh yeah

572
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,080
And then we can sing this song

573
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,080
And it won't feel wrong

574
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,080
To let the melody

575
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
Wash away you

La la la la la la

578
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,080
There's a little more to learn from the brain

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,080
One

580
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
