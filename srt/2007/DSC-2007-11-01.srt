00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We don't need most heat increase in it.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Testing his battery.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's foggy and California, my friends.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Good morning.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How you doing?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm drank a lot of time to kill them in me of your face.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
To buy your house for the million time today.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I'm over and I

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm just a man, just a man, just a man, now I'm over it, and it's been too long, and I wonder how this whole emptiness I've got it.

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm just a man, just a man, just a man, now I'm over it, and I wonder how this whole emptiness I've got.

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hey everybody, how you doing? Welcome to the Curry Condo.

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No, then California. We're in San Francisco. It is the Daily Source Code episode number 680.

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Kick it off with Valley Lodge. I'm so over it.

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Great. Bring it home boys.

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There's a morning. It's very foggy outside. The condo, it is bright and early.

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How you doing everybody? Almost didn't do a show this morning.

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Had all kinds of technical difficulties, we'll get into that later on.

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Nice to be in California. Nice to be in San Francisco. Nice to have my friends welcoming me back to town.

30
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Good evening. Hey, Adam. It's Ranger Craig on the Rock. Hope you bring a shock mouth to your microphone while you're in San Francisco.

31
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We have a pretty good little shake last night, 5.6 with about 30 aftershocks.

32
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Any case, just what I'm saying, hey, you have the Halloween. Enjoy your stay at San Francisco.

33
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You know how to reach me if I can be of any help.

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And I actually have a favorite to ask you.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, but we'll leave that for another time. Greetings from the Rock.

36
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
From the Rock Ranger Craig.

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Check it in. He's Ranger Craig. He sits out there on Alcatraz,

38
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
which there's no way I can see Alcatraz today. Let me tell you.

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I can barely see the Bay Bridge.

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And in fact, I can't even see the top of the Tower of Death.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
My goodness, this thing is so unbelievable.

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You know what they've done up there. And by the way, thanks, Ranger Craig,

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
for the for the warning about the earthquakes.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, we have almost a 6.0 the other day here. Oh, man.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Can't believe I missed that one.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The Tower of Death that is now nearing completion across the way from the condo.

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Apparently at the top of the building,

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
they have this like whole water construction, like a huge water tank

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
that is supposed to counterbalance any, uh,

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
supposed to counterbalance any earthquakes.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
All I can see is I'm going to be really fucking wet

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
if that thing kills over.

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm going to get that water right on my head.

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, yeah, I need to say something nasty and Swedish.

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Hi, I just thought I'd show the drunken Londoner and I couldn't resist.

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So here's it. Here's it. It isn't Swedish.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't carry it. No, not a. Yeah, yes.

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So no, not a.

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's the nasty version of Yelskadi.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, boy. I got to tell you so many things happened yesterday.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Of course, got to brighten early, uh,

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
hopped on, uh, on the virgin Atlantic upper class to, uh,

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to ride and over to San Francisco.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Of course, completely un-eventful as, uh, as usual.

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I did watch, um,

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Michael Moore's new movie, Sickko on the airplane.

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And, uh, I hadn't seen this movie yet.

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I certainly encourage you to see it.

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You know, I have very, very mixed feelings about this.

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you haven't seen Michael Moore's Sickko,

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
uh, it's essentially it's about health care in America versus health care in, uh,

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
in other countries. I'd say, and, and I'd have to say,

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
it's a beautiful piece of work.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It really shows the differences between, um,

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the general health,

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and health care in, uh, in the United States.

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And it compares it to, uh, Britain,

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and the kingdom and, uh,

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
who have the National Health Service, which is a socialized medicine,

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and it, uh, compares it to what else, uh,

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to France.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And I got to tell you, I have been in many of these countries.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I've lived in the UK for the past three years.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I know what the NHS is,

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and I did not think the movie was very accurate.

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Um, in fact, well, what it didn't do is it didn't, um,

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
show any of the problems that these countries have because of the way

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
their medicine is socialized.

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Um, and although it looks fantastic,

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and it is, of course, fantastic the NHS,

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
because you basically pay nothing as like six pounds you pay for medicine,

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
you know, instead of the hundreds or thousands of, uh,

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
of pounds or dollars in other countries.

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Um, in France, uh, you know,

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
it's like, wow, what a well-hala.

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But what Michael Moore doesn't do is he doesn't show the huge problems

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
that are going on with the NHS right now,

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
or the huge problems that are going on with France in general.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Economically, financially, or economic, or economic kind of the same thing.

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Economically, socially, culturally.

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You know, there's lots and lots of problems with socialized services.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Not to say that it's a bad idea, you know,

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
uh, I like the, I have a, my wife is ill, you know,

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
it's a, I pay huge amount in an extra insurance,

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
in case anything happens.

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The real core of the problem, which I feel wasn't discussed in that movie,

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
is that the drug companies,

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and of course a lot of the private hospitals, or for profit hospitals,

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and it's just gotten out of control.

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The pricing is just out of control.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's really the problem.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Uh, you know, there's no discussion of the billions of pounds

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
that NHS is costing, how many people are really pissed off,

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
computer systems that are a billion pounds over budget,

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
aren't working, uh, people dying of the super bug,

116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
you know, maybe that wasn't really apparent at the time this was made,

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but I don't know.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The one thing, the one thing that I, the one quote that's stuck out from this movie

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
that I really, really liked, um,

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and was these expats living in France, you know,

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and boy, they were living it up.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's for sure.

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Um,

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the quote was,

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
in America, people are afraid of the government

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
when they want something changed, they're afraid.

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But in France, they take to the streets and they protest.

128
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And that I thought was a very good point.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And, uh,

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and something to think about, something, uh,

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I will be touching on in the next couple of shows.

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't want to get too deep because well, mainly it's, uh,

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
not even seven o'clock in the morning here.

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's kind of tough.

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I cannot wait to tell you what happened when I landed in San Francisco,

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
but first, I had, uh,

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you know, those technical problems I was telling you about.

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's almost as if my, my lovely son,

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Sony Vio, knew that I'd receive this voice comment

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and was actually contemplating looking into it.

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hey, Adam, this chip was top of the populate.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And, uh,

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I was listening to your last show and you're talking about getting

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
back up and running again.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And, uh, the only thing you were really wanting

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Windows for was you could all, uh,

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
cast laughter, which, uh,

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
with my PC,

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I was talking about using love and,

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and if I ever am on the road,

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
not using my PC laptop,

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
then I will definitely, uh,

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
use it and recommend cast laughter highly.

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
However, uh,

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
you might know that, uh,

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I switched over to Mac at home,

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and really had been enjoying it a lot.

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And, uh,

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
the first things I did was start to mess with a garage band,

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
as you know, I have a band too,

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and you play my music before,

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
so I really appreciate that.

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Uh, you know,

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I was talking to Matthew Ebel on an interview on my show,

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and then he was talking about how he made his whole beer,

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and it was a coffee and cigarette.

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He was, uh,

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
on his, uh,

169
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
garage band.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And so I thought,

171
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
well, I'll give it a shot.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll get a Mac and try to start eating

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
garage band.

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And, first practice song I did,

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
is a matter of fact you play on your show,

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
because it was a...

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's right, remember?

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, but they've a boy song.

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, heroes.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You can be curious.

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And, although,

182
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I did struggle

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and play all the guitars and all the instruments on it,

184
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and learn how to use and send it to you,

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and you did play it on the show,

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
with the lady Patricia present.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You told her that it was a karaoke version

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
with me saying,

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
oh, sorry.

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And I will have to say,

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
um,

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
who's right now.

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Fuck you.

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah.

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Fuck you.

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're the fish that you are.

197
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Sorry.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know what's going on with the sound today.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It sounds weird.

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah.

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So the point, sorry, man.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I didn't mean to,

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
to harsh your mellow with that.

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah, the point being that, um,

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Uber Castro hadn't looked at it in a long, long time,

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and it's come a long, long way.

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And so I started to install this on the,

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
the MacBook Pro,

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and I was indeed quite impressed with one small problem.

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There's a delay in the microphone channel.

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So I, it's like impossible to speak,

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
because you hear there's delay,

213
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and then you start to talk like that.

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So I got to figure that one out,

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
until then it's a trusty cast blaster.

216
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And cast blaster didn't want to start up this morning.

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That was nice.

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You know, like,

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
running around at 630 in the morning,

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
freaking out.

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Bye.

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay.

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So hey, guys.

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Guess what?

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
All of this talk that we've been having about,

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the constitution and skull fuck the rotting corpse of the TSA,

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and all those fine things.

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The Ron Paul interview.

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm on the list.

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, yes.

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This already happened to me once in Chicago,

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and I wasn't quite sure if it was just an anomaly.

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That was the last time I was in the States.

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yesterday I arrived at San Francisco International Airport.

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Had a nice little chat with the Customs officer.

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So hey, Adam, yeah.

237
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We used to watch an MTV.

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What you doing?

239
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah.

240
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Living in the UK, cool, man.

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
All right.

242
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Well, have fun.

243
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So let's me go.

244
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I go through to get my suitcase.

245
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And about, before my suitcase came off,

246
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
so maybe only five minutes after I'm standing there,

247
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the same guy had apparently come running from

248
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
his little cubicle there.

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I said, oh, Adam,

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
can I just have your customs form for a second?

251
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah.

252
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I got to write something on it.

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And he writes on it, baggage check.

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And I say, oh, why is that?

255
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Did you just all of a sudden decide you wanted to check me?

256
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No, I don't know.

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Something popped up in the computer.

258
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

259
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So I had to go in the other line.

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And waited for about half an hour before it was my turn.

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And the Homeland Security Officer started asking me some questions.

262
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And I said, oh, he did my passport.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
American citizen.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What are you here for?

265
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I have a business here.

266
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I live in the UK.

267
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And oh, you're a so-you're on business.

268
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes, I am.

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You have a business card.

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Now Patricia had made me wear a different coat when I left.

271
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And I was pretty low on cards, but that's where I keep a stack.

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And so I hadn't transferred that stack over to my other pocket.

273
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And I said, oh, shit man.

274
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't know my wife made you wear a different coat.

275
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So I have to look for one.

276
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't know if I have one.

277
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well, I really need to see a business card.

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm saying, and this is where I've, of course, made a mistake.

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And I said, excuse me.

280
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Isn't my passport enough?

281
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Well, this, of course, was the wrong question.

282
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, if you don't want to stand here for another two hours, you better show me a business card.

283
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That was pretty much the response.

284
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And then, of course, they proceeded to open up all of my business.

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I had nothing.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You know, no contraband, no bad stuff, no nothing,

287
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
but thoroughly searched.

288
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And finally, I found a card of James.

289
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
James is our, he runs all production in the UK.

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So we'll look, man, here's a company card.

291
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's not mine.

292
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But here's the UK address.

293
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Anyway, so for some reason, that seemed to be sufficient.

294
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But I'm on the list.

295
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I am most definitely on the list, and I'm not quite sure what it is,

296
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
but it's not a pretty one because I am going to get ripped apart every single time I come into the states.

297
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And I'm just not going to buckle.

298
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You know, and I'm going to give these guys shit when they,

299
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
tell me that I can't enter the United States without a business card.

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's horseshit.

301
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I was actually, I was pretty angry about this yesterday.

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm much calmer now, but this is how it goes, I guess.

303
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And I told Patricia, he says, you know,

304
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
it's just, you know, you've got a big mouth,

305
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and you're just not a likable guy.

306
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That's the problem.

307
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You see, you've swamped keys.

308
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Hey, you know, does anybody ever push the button to try to send you effects?

309
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Does it ever happen?

310
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah, it does.

311
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Hey, about this female guy.

312
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You've just said his name.

313
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I was just listening.

314
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't remember what I mean now.

315
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The way I heard it, he got promoted.

316
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh, that promotion you were talking about, he was up for it.

317
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That you didn't think he got it.

318
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah.

319
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He got it, like right after that big press conference.

320
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Like somebody would buy it.

321
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He had a good job of that wag the dog incident there, son.

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He got promoted.

323
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But then, like, more up or happen,

324
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and I guess as I said,

325
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
to me, he got, he got shit can, he's out.

326
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But the dog knows it's only because some attention got

327
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
to some light got shown on that situation or whatever.

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah.

329
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The only way in the Bush administration that you can get promoted

330
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
is to be incompetent and proven.

331
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Just as, uh, just as Brownie.

332
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah.

333
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Fuck you out.

334
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, yeah.

335
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Thank you.

336
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I got to work on these voice mail, uh,

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
on the quality of the sound.

338
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Something's going wrong with the trans coding there.

339
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, of course.

340
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay, it fired.

341
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
He actually got promoted.

342
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Of course he did.

343
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
This is the guy who set up the fake conference.

344
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
A lot of red pill running through my veins,

345
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
my friends.

346
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's for sure.

347
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So I'll run Paul on the tonight show.

348
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That was pretty cool.

349
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Uh, not so marginal anymore.

350
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
A.

351
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And Hillary, you know,

352
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
comic strip blogger.

353
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You keep telling me that Hillary is a shoe in

354
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
for the Democratic nomination.

355
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't know if you saw the, uh,

356
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
the debate, which was on two days ago.

357
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't think so.

358
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, yeah.

359
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's still anybody's race.

360
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And in the infamous words,

361
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Ron Paul on the tonight show.

362
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Hey, you know,

363
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
there's a danger.

364
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I could actually just, like,

365
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
kind of win this.

366
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Comic strip.

367
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Comic strip.

368
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Comic strip.

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Comic strip.

370
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Comic strip.

371
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Comic strip.

372
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Comic strip.

373
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Comic strip.

374
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Comic strip.

375
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Comic strip.

376
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Comic strip.

377
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Comic strip.

378
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So, of course,

379
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
with me now being on the TSA shit list.

380
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Comic strip blogger is timely as usual.

381
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Adam Kerry.

382
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This or your comment.

383
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's not about your opinion on as usual.

384
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Okay.

385
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It may be disturbing to you.

386
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This is your last chance.

387
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Stop listening to this or your comment and

388
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
delete it.

389
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Delete it.

390
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If you don't want to be disturbed,

391
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
the comment will end.

392
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And you will wake up in your bed.

393
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And believe whatever you want.

394
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Okay.

395
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
This is a comic strip blogger's red pill blue pill.

396
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I think.

397
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Hello.

398
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
See you as be.

399
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So, do I stick with me?

400
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes.

401
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You prefer?

402
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah.

403
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Red pill, my friend.

404
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Red pill.

405
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Bring it on.

406
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Bring it on.

407
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Bring it on.

408
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Okay.

409
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You wanted it.

410
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So, first listen to this.

411
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It is an airplane with which I flow.

412
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Last weekend.

413
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, sounds like a...

414
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Sessner.

415
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
172.

416
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Maybe even a 182.

417
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Definitely a like-coming engine.

418
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
As an airplane-hit test.

419
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What airplane was it?

420
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's a like-coming engine.

421
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I can hear that.

422
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yes.

423
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It is just not airplane.

424
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But it is not the point.

425
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Now, listen to me, Adam Boy.

426
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Tell me.

427
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Do you seriously think that you can fuck with various interests, groups,

428
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
without endangering yourself?

429
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Don't you think that some groups may send a contract killer

430
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
to eliminate you?

431
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Adam.

432
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You have changed.

433
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I knew you at the time when you preferred to fool around about gadgets

434
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and see the fun things like sex, drugs, and rockin' out.

435
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Now, you got political.

436
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You got serious.

437
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You fuck with more or less secrets and dangerous groups, Adam.

438
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I am afraid that once upon a time,

439
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
we may find out that your chestnut airplane had some accident.

440
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And we will know then that they have reached Adam.

441
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But then we will be too late.

442
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Adam, come back to your silliness and stop that political crap.

443
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Ignorance is please.

444
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Fuck you.

445
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah.

446
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Fucker.

447
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yo.

448
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yo.

449
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Alright, I woke up.

450
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I still got the red pill coursing through my vein.

451
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
CSB.

452
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah.

453
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Patricia said something very similar.

454
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You know, and I have received a lot of emails about this.

455
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
People saying, hey dude, you know, you should really be careful.

456
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You should watch out what you say.

457
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So two points to your statement there.

458
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
CSB one.

459
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You know, this is what you guys are talking about.

460
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I mean, I'm trolling my email.

461
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm trolling my voice smells.

462
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm looking for feedback.

463
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm not getting any naked pictures.

464
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm not getting any gadget stuff.

465
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
All I'm getting is political stuff.

466
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So we're kind of going with the flow.

467
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It goes both ways, right?

468
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
If you want to talk about something else,

469
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
if you want me to pontificate about my MacBook Pro.

470
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'll do that a little bit more because I am going to get some version of

471
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Uber Caster up and rolling.

472
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But I will not be silenced, my friend.

473
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm sorry.

474
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And yeah, you're absolutely right.

475
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And when you said this about the airplane, I'm like, yeah,

476
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
as someone could absolutely sabotage the aircraft.

477
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And what's the worst thing that could happen?

478
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I think failure, I guess.

479
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I guess that would be possible to sabotage it.

480
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You know, it's in a hanger.

481
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm not around it.

482
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's marginally protected.

483
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There's lots of people who have access to it.

484
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So it could someone do something.

485
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, absolutely.

486
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Am I going to be afraid of that?

487
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
No, apps are fucking loosely not.

488
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I will continue to say what I feel is on my mind.

489
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Because that is my right.

490
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And if you hear about an engine failure,

491
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
then you'll know what happened.

492
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And the first thing you need to do

493
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
is seal off the area, call in wing commander William,

494
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
because he'll know exactly what happened.

495
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But I'm just not, you know, I can't live that way.

496
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Comics are blogger.

497
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I can't live in fear of what I say.

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So as much as I appreciate it.

499
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Just going to leave it the way it is.

500
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
A little concern.

501
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I have a fantastic rant.

502
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Listener called up that I want to play for you.

503
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I hope it doesn't sound as shitty as the other ones.

504
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I might have to wait until tomorrow to play it for you.

505
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm going to be able to shop because it's a great rant.

506
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's two minutes and it's just really, really.

507
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's a great rant.

508
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Check it out.

509
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Hey Adam.

510
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Hey, this is Mark and Los Angeles.

511
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm not trying to get on your show or anything.

512
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I just wanted to respond on show 679,

513
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
DST.

514
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't know the caller's name,

515
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
but he had a comment about putting candidates on your show

516
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
or getting candidates on your show

517
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
to talk to the DST listeners.

518
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And you've got a great audience.

519
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Obviously, I mean, I'm very conservative.

520
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And I love your show.

521
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I love listening to the range of people that are on it.

522
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And if somebody doesn't have the ball to get on your show

523
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and tell it like it is and be able to talk

524
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
without, like, quote, talking point to being positioned.

525
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And just, you know, your audience is an audience that's worldwide.

526
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And it's an audience that ranges to an elected people

527
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
that are real.

528
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You know, none of this can crap.

529
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And maybe that's what we need to do is get these people

530
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
from, you know, given us the crap they think we want to hear

531
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
in tell us who they are, what they're thinking.

532
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And get show a little nuts.

533
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You know, get out there a little bit.

534
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And risk something.

535
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't know.

536
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
If I was a bummer right now or Edward,

537
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and I wanted to try to do something different.

538
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'd be on your show at a heartbeat.

539
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'd be on it.

540
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'd park straight out as it is.

541
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And I would sit there and say, hey, look at, you know what?

542
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This is what we want.

543
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This is where we're going.

544
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And this is what we can be.

545
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And you don't have to settle for this stuff.

546
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And the only person that I got that, and I really enjoyed it,

547
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
was Ron Paul.

548
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I mean, I could not even think about voting for a Republican before.

549
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And Joe, I listened to Ron Paul.

550
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And I started listening to him and his passion

551
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
and his who he is.

552
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What he thinks.

553
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And then it is that if there's anything we need more than anything else.

554
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And this damn world that we're living in right now is people we think.

555
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And you can talk to anybody at any time and tell, you know,

556
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
we need and we need another Kennedy.

557
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
We need some intelligence.

558
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And you know, we need something that says, hey,

559
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
you know, let's face it and push down a great job.

560
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We need something.

561
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Hold on, better than what we've got.

562
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Oh, man.

563
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Thank you so much.

564
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And everyone listening should thank this guy because that's right.

565
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You guys are awesome.

566
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The audience of the Daily Source Code is freaking awesome.

567
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I get up at 630 in the morning because you guys are awesome.

568
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Absolutely.

569
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Anyone's welcome to come on the show at any time.

570
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
After I get these voice mail fixed.

571
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Sounds like shit.

572
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
All right.

573
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I got so much to do.

574
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Though, yeah, homework for you, which we're really talking about

575
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
in the next couple of days about black water, I do want to talk about that.

576
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
If you haven't seen it, Eric Prince, by the way,

577
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
is from Dutch descent.

578
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It turns out his parents as grandparents were Dutch.

579
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Very, very wealthy, very influential.

580
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
He is the guy that founded and is the CEO of that private security firm

581
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
that has so many forces in Iraq.

582
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You've got to see this interview on Charlie Rose because,

583
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and you know, this guy, all right, you can call him a war prophet here.

584
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You can call him a successful businessman.

585
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You can think he's shady or whatever.

586
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And that's not the real problem.

587
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I listen to what he said.

588
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And he was answering, I think, appropriately.

589
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The point is, did you know that there are thousands?

590
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I mean, like thousands of private security firms that are working for the United States,

591
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
all over the world.

592
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Did you know this?

593
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Were you aware of this?

594
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I mean, our army is just a small part of,

595
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
of the, of the manpower that is being,

596
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
it's almost like it's a commercial draft, you know?

597
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
We can't get enough guys, so we're going to, you know, we'll do,

598
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
we'll bring in some commercial guys.

599
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And this guy's mission is to do what,

600
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
federal expressed it for the post office, the US mail,

601
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
to do that for the armed forces.

602
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I can't really fault him.

603
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And I think barking up his tree is the wrong one.

604
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Probably smells a little bit of dog pee at the, at the base anyway.

605
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So I think that's the wrong way to go.

606
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
What is just surprising and astounding, I feel,

607
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
is that no one really knew that all of these private security firms

608
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
were doing all this war work for us.

609
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's known as the, what is it though?

610
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The war industrial complex isn't, isn't that what it's called?

611
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Hey Adam Jason from San Diego.

612
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm, I just wanted to give two cents about the black water thing.

613
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I was for a consulting firm that there's a lot of government contracts.

614
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah, I'm sorry, this sounds like shit.

615
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Well, we'll deal with that on Monday,

616
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
because I don't want to do it tomorrow on Friday.

617
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
His point is there's tons of contractors.

618
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I didn't, yeah, of course I knew that, you know,

619
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
commercial firms build the, the machinery.

620
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It is the war industrial complex.

621
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
That's really what's going on here.

622
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And a lot of our money is going in making a lot of people rich

623
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and making a lot of people dead.

624
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And I'm not not.

625
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Let's play something that we need to play at every time this year,

626
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
because it is the first of November, my friend.

627
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
The first winter snow outside my window.

628
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Feels like at that time again to me.

629
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
The mistletoe, a Christmas show.

630
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And the lighting of that famous Christmas tree.

631
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
People are shopping for them loved ones.

632
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm making plans for a Christmas feast.

633
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But it all goes by.

634
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And the rain goes by.

635
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And then we have to wait.

636
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Another year.

637
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What if every day?

638
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Christmas.

639
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What a wonderful world.

640
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
This would be.

641
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It would never feel blue.

642
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
We make all our dreams come true.

643
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:35,000
With Christmas we're everything.

644
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It was time to bring out the good people.

645
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I just look around now and you will see it.

646
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Everybody's nice and full of light.

647
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And they give to those who are in need.

648
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
What if every day?

649
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Christmas.

650
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What a wonderful world.

651
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
This would be.

652
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It would never feel blue.

653
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We make all our dreams come true.

654
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
With Christmas we're everything.

655
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It was time to bring out the good people.

656
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It was time to bring out the good people.

657
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It was time to bring out the good people.

658
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It was time to bring out the good people.

659
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
What if every day?

660
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Christmas.

661
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
What a wonderful world.

662
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
This would be.

663
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It would never feel blue.

664
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We make all our dreams come true.

665
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
With Christmas we're everything.

666
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
What if every day?

667
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Christmas.

668
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What a wonderful world.

669
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
This would be.

670
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It would never feel blue.

671
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We make all our dreams come true.

672
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
With Christmas we're everything.

673
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
What a wonderful world.

674
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
This would be.

675
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It would never feel blue.

676
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It was time to bring out the good people.

677
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It was time to bring out the good people.

678
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It was time to bring out the good people.

679
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I would never feel blue.

680
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I would never feel blue.

681
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That would be.

682
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It would never feel blue.

683
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
This would be.

684
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It would never feel blue.

685
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It would never feel blue.

686
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It would never feel blue.

687
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It would never feel blue.

688
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:37,840
There's Christmas to the body.

689
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,240
Some of you who are new to the program won't know about that.

690
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,720
I think this is the third year running that we're playing it.

691
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,240
That's right, three years ago.

692
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
We created this song.

693
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
It's Podsafe for Peace.

694
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,920
It's a whole list of Podsafe music artists.

695
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,080
You can find the link in the show notes.

696
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,920
Of course, a dating source code dot com to find out more about the project.

697
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,640
It's for a good cause.

698
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,480
It's fun to play this now, third year running and it sounds just as good as the first

699
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
time.

700
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:12,600
Before I go, I just want to say that I was watching the Democratic presidential debate and

701
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:20,840
they were talking about the drum beating going into Iran, Iran, bad guys, nuclear weapons,

702
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,600
Iran, Iran and I realized, we've got to really be careful.

703
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,560
With the way we're talking about Iran, there are a fucking people who live there.

704
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,040
Like 90 million people and they're sophisticated and they've got internet and they can

705
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,040
listen to stuff and they can read web blogs and they have web blogs.

706
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,880
Let's not just talk about Iran, like at some fucking clump somewhere, we're just can drop

707
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,880
a bomb and all problems are solved.

708
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
I'm embarrassed.

709
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,480
I am absolutely embarrassed, not about the conversation, but the way we're talking.

710
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,760
I mean, it's crazy, I know there must be someone in Iran who listens to the show.

711
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,920
Please call the voice mail line.

712
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,640
Please, you know, I remember I put up a video.

713
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,360
I'll see if I can find it a video of some teenagers, young people, like 20 year olds, having

714
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,240
a party in Iran.

715
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,240
Guess what?

716
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,560
It looked just like a party in San Francisco in New York or London or Berlin or Amsterdam.

717
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
It was a fucking party.

718
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,080
It's like these are like people like you and me.

719
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,080
Yeah, there's something really seriously fucked up with what's happening here.

720
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,160
Oops, I just got on to another TSA list.

721
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,160
Can you hear it?

722
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,760
I can hear the pen scrunching on the paper.

723
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,120
So I apologize.

724
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,880
Our leadership or assholes right now, we're working on that.

725
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
We're trying to fix that.

726
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,720
And the meantime, please, if you're in Iran and you listen to the show, give me a shout.

727
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Let me know, okay?

728
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,320
Because I need to hear some humanity here for a second.

729
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,840
I just can't stand this Iran talk.

730
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,400
And it's not like these people are fucking desert bunnies, okay?

731
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,760
It's like sophisticated cell phones.

732
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,760
They got iPods.

733
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
Geez, Louise.

734
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,200
All right, tomorrow we'll do a food bar Friday.

735
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,400
And we won't go too deep.

736
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:08,480
So I'm looking for stuff to talk about gadgets, looking for stuff to talk about chicks, naked

737
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,640
pictures, and hey, if you want to see us, we'll do some political crap.

738
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,160
Adam and podshow.com, dailysourceco.com, I'll see you tomorrow for a food bar Friday.
