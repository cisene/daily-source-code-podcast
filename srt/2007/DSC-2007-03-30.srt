00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the DSC 5773, I'm your pilot Steve and please pay attention

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,440
to the flight attendants in the aisle at the head of the plane. Please notice that the seat

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,320
belt sign is on remain strapped in your seat until the light goes off. Look around you

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,440
and locate the nearest exit should there be an emergency. Remember not to fast forward through

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,720
any of the good parts and pay attention to all jingles. Smoking is not permitted in the plane

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,360
until after you hear the lighter clicks at the end of the show. If the plane should happen to

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,640
start to descend at a very rapid rate, please bend over, kiss your ass could buy and say it's

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,760
Fubar Friday. Thank you for flying the DSC 5773.

9
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:18,240
Hey this is Paul Durham from the Band Black Lab. In the aftermath of the enormous success of

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,120
bum rush the charts, the chairman and heads of NR of every major label called and offered me a

11
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:30,320
record deal. Come back to the fold they said we want to make you famous. Okay I said I'll do it.

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,760
I'll sell my soul for a third time. I'll give up creative control and any hope of a long-term

13
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,360
career as a musician. There's only one thing I ask. What they said will give you anything.

14
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,880
Chairman and heads of NR set your music free. Let hardcasters from around the world play the

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,080
songs you control. Let them remind us of great music we've forgotten about and turn us on to new

16
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,920
stuff that is actually good. So that we may go out and buy it for ourselves. Stop acting like

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,920
morons thinking that podcasting is somehow going to hurt sales. Stop strangling the golden goose

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,080
and let us all have eggs. No they shouted never are they screamed as each one of them in turn

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,560
slammed down the phone. So here I am back with the rest of you crouching in my fox hole as the

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:26,240
revolution rages around us. But I have one thing to say to you cigar chambers. I've got my microphone

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:34,000
and my guitar. I've got my computer and my internet connection. I'm coming for you and I'm out for blood.

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:55,760
Good you said the bad my way. I'm following this notion. It's making all things clear.

23
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:09,440
I find it found my place and you're not here. But you got the last love.

24
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,720
But you got the last love for this broken heart today.

25
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:32,240
Everything gets longer this way. We are only half of what we've made.

26
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:46,880
You're shallow west the ocean. It's empty as my field. I find it got too far in your

27
00:03:46,880 --> 00:04:03,200
heart. But you got the last love. You got the last love. You got the last love for this broken heart today.

28
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:18,640
It always ends in the letter. It always leaves me dry. No time to love. No time to say goodbye.

29
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:41,920
But you got the last love. You got the last love for this broken heart today.

30
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:57,520
But you got the last love. You got the last love. You got the last love for this broken heart today.

31
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:09,760
Because nothing's quite as simple as you say.

32
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,960
Everybody how you doing. Welcome to Fubar Friday from a very wet afloan suburb of Surrey

33
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,200
known as Gilford. It's the west side of Gtown from the curry manner. It is your Delta Sierra

34
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,560
Charlie and indeed no lady Patricia. But not because she didn't agree to come on the show today.

35
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,000
Because I asked her actually not to come on. Next week as you know I'm traveling to San Francisco. I'm

36
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
actually traveling on Monday for a change. I got some stuff to do on Sunday. And on Saturday,

37
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,320
the lady P and I will create a show which will air on Monday. So if you if you're disappointed,

38
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,120
please bear with me because we've got a great show lined up for you.

39
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,120
This is story about a man. By the way, I was such a dick.

40
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,200
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

41
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,640
That's fine, man.

42
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,640
Stuff.

43
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,480
RSS feed. Is that sound right? Yeah, on this, it said this very frequency, this very RSS feed. Hey, oh my goodness.

44
00:06:52,480 --> 00:07:01,760
Got so much to talk about. No one, absolutely no one responded that I saw to my quest for a decision I had to make,

45
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:10,560
whether to buy a new digital transmitter receiver pair for viewing television in the kitchen or to do it

46
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,480
through a sling block, sling box. I just went out and I got one. Let me tell you, this was a very

47
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,040
interesting experience. I've been reading about the sling box, never really had any need for it. I didn't

48
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,560
know that it actually is marketed as a device to watch television inside your home in different

49
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,600
locations. I thought it was intended purely to stream outside your home, which it does do. I haven't tested

50
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,320
it actually, but it is configured and set up. And I think the router is all set up properly as well.

51
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,560
But it was pretty cool. I went to PC World here in Gilford. I pulled one off the rack and I was

52
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,680
looking to find out if it would connect wirelessly to anything within the home, which of course would be

53
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,920
absolutely perfect. I think the messaging on the outside of the box is not very clear. It definitely

54
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:03,360
did not say whether, it says, network requirements wired or wireless. I mean, not until you

55
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,080
actually open the box, do you figure out that you need to plug a hard wire into this thing that

56
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,960
goes into your router? I was already prepared for it because I got two of those power line

57
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,360
Ethernet adapters. You just plug into the wall and you plug one into your router and into the wall

58
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,200
and then the other one you can plug in anywhere in the house. That works really well. So I was

59
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,320
prepared for that. And I had those. I had a different use form if I wouldn't need them. But the whole

60
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,880
experience of opening the sling box, you know, you see the picture and it looks like this

61
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,560
kind of like a titanium dipped Hershey bar. You know, it looks really, really sexy and it has those

62
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,920
three like modules that are all placed in the egg carton fashion together and you just really feel

63
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,520
good about it and you open it up and it's like this really cheap plastic thing. Very disappointing

64
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,720
experience. They could learn a lot from Apple. It was no porn. It was like a downer, man. Like a

65
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,520
way downer when it comes to gadget porn. It doesn't matter because the device works as advertised

66
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:07,760
and it's fantastic. So I was able to throw out the extra TV from the kitchen, downloaded the

67
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,960
Mac software for Patricia's eye Mac, it works. It's amazing. It is so good. Now, the whole idea

68
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,800
of being able to get up from the living room and walk into the kitchen and not miss anything while

69
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,800
the show is, well, whatever is running is running. It gets a little bit obviscated by the fact that

70
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,680
there's a 8 to 10 second delay between what you're seeing live and what is actually being received

71
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,840
on the receiving computer inside the home. Well, that is, if you're going from living room to kitchen,

72
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,360
it's okay, but if you go to kitchen from from kitchen to living room, you're bound to miss

73
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,440
10 seconds of very valuable airtime. We'll get used to that and I can't wait to try it from San Francisco

74
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,840
see if I can access the box from outside the home network. In fact, I like it so much. I'm going

75
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,280
to get one for San Francisco, so I could watch TV here. It's absolutely phenomenal. Great piece

76
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,440
of technology. Very, very bad on the porn factor, but man, oh man, oh man. Let me see,

77
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,520
for our food bar Friday, I got something in from Virgin Atlantic. Oh, I love it when companies

78
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:18,160
do this. Dear Adam, Hollywood has the Oscars. Britain has the BAFTAs. Virgin Atlantic has heroes.

79
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,680
Hmm. Our heroes program is the reward and recognition scheme for outstanding

80
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,320
Virgin Atlantic team members and it's up to you to nominate them. I love doing this. When companies

81
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,520
do this, I always participate. I hate surveys. I don't participate in any feedback for, you know,

82
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,920
they, I think Virgin Atlantic has figured out how to make me feel good and then I'm a good customer.

83
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,800
They have not disappointed ever. So I'd like to, I'd like to give back, check this out.

84
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,280
The heroes program gives you a chance to single out the Virgin Atlantic team member who has gone

85
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,080
above and beyond the proverbial call of duty to make your journey with us absolutely fantastic.

86
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,720
After all, as a flank club goal member, you'll fly with us. You fly with us more than anyone,

87
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,720
so you know us better than everyone, blah, blah, blah. If your hero is chosen as a finalist,

88
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,240
they will be in, they will be in with a chance. Kind of being, which is that. If your hero is chosen

89
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,240
as a finalist, they will be in with a chance of winning £1,000 and could go on to win the superhero

90
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,120
award of £10,000. Plus, you and a guest will be invited to accompany them to the glittering

91
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,840
awards night in London this summer. Oh, yes. Okay. I think we should have like a secret word or something.

92
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:33,040
And on my next trip, my round trip. Excuse me, this has to be in by April 12. Yeah, no problem.

93
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,160
So the flight over and the flight back, we should have something that if any Virgin Atlantic

94
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,520
person says that word or does something in particular, um, that we've already pre-decided,

95
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:51,840
then they'll get my vote as a finalist for the Virgin Atlantic Heroes 2007. Okay. So post your

96
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,600
comments at the dailysourcecode.com because I'll need that for from Monday. All right. And then I'll

97
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,040
make sure the lady P and I talk about it on, uh, on Monday as well, which of course will be recorded

98
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:11,440
Saturday. Oh, boy, I'm getting confused already. Paul Rogolinski. Hey, Adam, you really should get paid

99
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,600
by Nokia. I just got my N800 yesterday. Mostly because you've pointed out so many times on your show,

100
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,040
looking forward to develop some apps, seems like a solid Debbie and platform. Mm-hmm.

101
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,080
Linux porn. Keep up the great work. And maybe you could mention Scott's ancestor,

102
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,560
Rush the Charts thing tomorrow on football. His deadline is April the first. Yeah, absolutely.

103
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,520
We had bum rush the charts, which was, well, you heard Paul Durham talk all about at the opening of the

104
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,080
show. And Scott Singler is really going to go into make quite a mark. I think he has a much better chart

105
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,280
to deal with the Amazon chart. I know he has so many people who are, uh, including his work that they're

106
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:54,960
going to go and buy this book, the minute it hits. And, uh, yeah, we got a problem over that.

107
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,760
Over the course of 19 weeks, one monster filled bloody audio book grew to terrifying audience of

108
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,960
30,000 listeners in the process. He became the number one literary show on iTunes and every other

109
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:16,720
podcast chart on April 1st. Scott Singler's thrilling horror novel, ancestor, closet wane the print.

110
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,320
On April Fool's Day, the of your copy of ancestor at amazon.com, or visit Scott Singler.net.

111
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,840
Or get your ass kicked by that guy with a ballsy voice.

112
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,600
American and Holland, and married to a Dutchie, too, is the subject of this email. Adam says,

113
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,720
Gina, hey, there. I recently added your podcast to my daily car commute from all me at a

114
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,280
to hoof door. She lives in the Netherlands. This is a new listener. I love talking about listeners

115
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,920
who don't have podcasts. Quick bit about me. I found your podcast since it's kind of neat. I'm an

116
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,160
American married to a Dutchie. I moved from Holland from my hobby two years ago. This June,

117
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,240
I was listening to one of my normal podcasts to it this week in tech. When you were a guest

118
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,040
or so ago, see how this works. You see how it works. She listened to a whole other show.

119
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,400
Didn't even know I existed or had forgotten about me. And then found my show. I love that.

120
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,600
He was funny because I was in my living room in almyra and hubby jumps in and says, hey,

121
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,160
that's Adam. He's Dutch. I didn't even realize you were the same dude. I knew from MTV.

122
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,000
So I said, no, he isn't Dutch and Google it to prove him. He told me stories about when you

123
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,920
lived here. You married a Dutchie also. You were fluent in Dutch, which is why he assumed

124
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,040
you were Dutch. So this is how I found your podcast. Now I listen daily. You're in my every morning

125
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,960
podcast list for my fun, two-hour drive to Hofdorf. Oh, yeah, traffic and Holland blows chunks.

126
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,520
PS, how the hell did you learn this language? Six months of private lessons. And it's still

127
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,560
freaking insanity to me. Thank God, I'm a web designer. Everything is English for me. Yeah,

128
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,640
well, my parents. At the time, I hated them for it. They threw me into Dutch school. Did I

129
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,920
ever tell you this story that we were when we moved in 72, we moved to the Netherlands? And the

130
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,000
three of us kids, myself, my two sisters went to the International School of Amsterdam, which at the

131
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,640
time was located in Osdorf. And we had a vacation, like a weeks vacation. And Sunday night they

132
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,720
they said, hey, kids come sitting in the kitchen here. We're going to talk for a second. Guess

133
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,400
what you guys are doing tomorrow. We had a whole week off so we're excited to say, what, what, what?

134
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:22,000
You're going to Dutch school. I spoke like three words of Dutch, two of which were fish and poop.

135
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,160
It was traumatizing. But in hindsight, and I don't think they did it because they couldn't

136
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,360
afford the International School anymore. That's why they did it. But in hindsight, fantastic. I'm

137
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,120
so happy. And I thanked them for that. Even if it maybe wasn't even intended. I'm very happy

138
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,160
that I had an international education. All right, blah, blah, keep up the fun podcast. Even

139
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,360
cooler when you mention Holland since I since I'm lost, I'm a lost American here. And it

140
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,400
makes me feel more at home. PPPs. Thanks for this for the fun and song in today's podcast. I bought

141
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:08,400
the album from under cover, keep, ah, take to. I bought the album from undercover hippie tonight,

142
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:15,120
not my normal style, but it's a fun sound. You know, Gina, I know a way, I know it'll make you feel

143
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:23,360
better. I really do. It's not that hard. It starts off with a naked picture. Adam and pochio.com.

144
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,800
They don't sell out 400 concerts a year.

145
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:46,480
They don't have the entire world in length of them. They are all independent, all about the music.

146
00:16:46,640 --> 00:17:06,400
I heard it on a podcast. Oh, yes, it's true. I'm going to quit my day chat. Stop laughing. This is just

147
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,400
down my mind. Work. We are in the midst of massive heat.

148
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,480
Throughout this past week, we've been talking about a number of things. One of them is

149
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,120
regulars, regular callers, and the rest of the world. And of course, I've said many a

150
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,840
time that the rest of the world are the regular callers. 80% of the show is put together by

151
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,320
the audience. One of our regular callers, who always has something interesting, just no,

152
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,480
about half of what he has to say is interesting, is a Charles the Drunken Londoner,

153
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,680
which is kind of a misnomer at this point because it's been a while since Charles was

154
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,040
called in completely hammered. Adam, hi, it's Charles. Yeah, good on your James.

155
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,360
People that produce regularly and get played every now and again, we will appreciate the fact that

156
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:10,400
Adam, I don't want to say a sentence, but certainly picks and chooses just the best bits

157
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,760
that are interesting, it's true. His listeners and his audience, I appreciate that, as I'm sure

158
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:23,760
so does everyone. Programmer seems to be getting the message. So yeah, different James, I'm with you

159
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:33,120
on that one. I'd be able to show Adam is becoming a inventor of the jingle to jingle

160
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,000
all the all jingles from flower and the jett and the suggests to me, which are they are fabulous.

161
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,640
I did like that 911 and I have to say, no, I like you, I think you're great, do it, keep going,

162
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:52,320
you know, what's the word you use? Adam, Contrary and or Contrary views. They make for a much

163
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,000
more interesting show. That's a slightly different note, I just like to urge everyone to head on

164
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:08,320
over to PWB digital slots and listen to his latest podcast. It is a really good episode in my opinion

165
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,040
and it really helps us all to recognize what's really going on in the world and what's really

166
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,840
important. So, I think I'll have to everyone out there fixed soon. Bye.

167
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,360
Yo, Charles, big up to you, man. Yeah, I told you guys the listen to that show before I'd actually

168
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,920
listen to it because I know that PWB stuff is always quality, but of course it's about the

169
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:36,000
passing of his dad. Oh, man. Oh, ho, ho. He want to go on a podcast emotional rollercoaster ride

170
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,680
and then that is the show for you. You definitely have to listen to it. Let's see what's going on

171
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:47,440
with those 15, 15 soldiers in Iran, home on a second. I've got to keep my eye in this

172
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,480
comic strip blogger sent me a pretty, like I almost like, hey dude, we've got to use the power

173
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:04,720
of podcasting to stop this because a suitcase or a clairvoyant, I guess. Told him that if something

174
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,320
wasn't done about it, there would be nuclear war. And it looks like a second sailor has a

175
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,640
apologize to Iran. I guess that's what they're looking for, huh? Okay, apologize and move on already.

176
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,800
Sorry for the confusion. Oh, boy. Now, this could get ugly. That's for sure.

177
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,240
Hey, let me see. Yeah. So, just briefly back to what Charles is saying about

178
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,880
callers regular calls. I got to tell you, I love it when people are different because that's always

179
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,800
interesting to me. You know, the look at comic strip blogger who has been labeled by many as a

180
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,560
stalker, really called a stalker and all kinds of horrible things. And without a doubt, he has an

181
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:57,280
interesting way of communicating. But I think he's smart and nylon who are also sometimes

182
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:05,040
contrary, and yes, indeed, sometimes abrasive, he's got to be smart. I've got an email from someone

183
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,560
about nylon that the New Yorker living in London. Let me see, who is this email from Devon?

184
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:21,280
He had something here to say about, well, maybe it's the email is too long.

185
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,920
All right, but he doesn't like nylon. I love it. I love you guys. In fact, you know, if Howard

186
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,960
Stern is his hero of the stupid, then I am the sultan of the Savans my friends.

187
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,680
Here's another one of the Charlie Savans. He is a prolific programmer and as you know, I'm trying to get

188
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,800
a prolific programmer, a conquester blogger, and nylon all together on a conference call have not yet

189
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,720
heard back from nylon. CSB coming up at first indeed, the prolific programmer. I didn't

190
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,760
program her here from San Francisco for things. First off, it's me girlfriend birthday tomorrow.

191
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:12,000
I appreciate you wishing to have a birthday on Fubar Friday. Okay, prolific programmer. Happy birthday

192
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,840
to your girlfriend. And would you mind sending me a naked picture of her? Name is Keras low and she is

193
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:26,320
okay. Just send me a naked picture. On to Canada. Second, I also have a song for you to play for her.

194
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,760
I'm not quite sure of it. Oh, okay. Oh, I love playing songs. Okay. I didn't see a link in your email.

195
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,520
Let's go. Sneagly pod save. It's been on Friday dance party. It's on the Sunday. It's at the

196
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,520
year of HTTP. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me do it with you here. HTTP,

197
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,360
colon colon. Yeah, this is the prolific programmer. So I want to take his instructions

198
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,760
quite literally if you don't mind. Okay, next year. Hold on, second. Here we go.

199
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:29,120
Send. Send ID equals equals. Send 3015162. Second thing. Wait a minute. That was genius.

200
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,880
Genius. Oh, yes. I'm, oh, man. I'm going to go back and I can't do it. I'm going to go back.

201
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,800
I'm going to listen to that three more times. I'm going to type it in exactly prolific

202
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,800
program. I love you, man. You didn't send me a link to the song. No, no, no. You give me an

203
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,960
audio version of the link. Fantastic. I, uh, sure on the show, I think it's a lot better when

204
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:59,360
she's here because you play off each other, which is always nice. Yeah. My, uh, I think you,

205
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,160
I don't think I give in my, my bio at all. I am a British born Asian working in San Francisco

206
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:13,600
for a computer company. Hence, I call myself a programmer. For thing, get this here. There are a few

207
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:21,120
thoughts I have on this. Namely, discrimination is wrong. However, we all do it. And we do it to others.

208
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:30,960
Our reaction is different. Then when it's done to ones, we respect or love. Have a good day. Have a

209
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,480
weekend. Have a good weekend. Have a good day. Have a good weekend. Have a good day. Have a good weekend. Have a good

210
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,160
weekend. Cheers. I just had to be quiet for a second there. The satellite window slam shot right at the end.

211
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,680
Ah, you see what I mean? I love this. A prolific program of fantastic.

212
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,160
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know. It's Friday, man. I'm footballer. I really

213
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,920
tired. I don't know about you. But if you thought that was the only savant who was going to show

214
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:05,280
about how wrong you are my friend. Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip.

215
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,840
Comic strip. Is this thing on? Is this thing on? Hello, Adam Kerry. Shouldn't we meet

216
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,240
up in the UK soon? Or is it not for you? Regarding me having session over a Skype with

217
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,960
prolific program and nylon, or surely my public Skype ID is the CSB. And I am available

218
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,080
after appointment at nine PM and 11 PM London time. Regarding paper post, I agree

219
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,400
with you. And as an example, I could mention Seth and Thief, who sold his company to AOL

220
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,880
and who attacks paper post constantly to get publicity. But at the same time, his bloggers

221
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:59,680
for years were being gripped. I think he's talking about Jason Calacanis. At the paper post thing

222
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,480
was just a little mention, please not to be turned to do a topic here. Go to the bloggers

223
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,080
rear if you want to talk about that. Guiding blogging code of conduct, just example, a blogging

224
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:18,000
code for Yahoo employees was signed also by certain retired Yahoo employees who defamed me

225
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:28,880
with lies and unchecked false accusations. Conclusion, everybody in blogosphere is a horror or a

226
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:37,360
covert core and hypocrisy is common. I'm happy that you see it too. Are we too

227
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,280
an anomaly in a sea of bullshit, an ocean of hypocrisy? Blogosphere? By the way,

228
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:55,840
Guid Patricia from Yam Yam, Apebam. Another one of our Charlie Savans, the infamous

229
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,400
comic strip blogger. Yeah. Yeah, of course. The things you're seeing online, which are only

230
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,240
going to get worse, which I hope we don't try and regulate. It's all a part of free speech and

231
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:16,720
it's going to get very, very ugly. And yes, I'm convinced that death and tears and sorrow and all

232
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:25,280
kinds of crap will occur. I will be the result of this open line of communication, this vast

233
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,600
open space where anything can be said, anything can be done. I've said it before. This is not

234
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:39,760
about laws. This is not about the government stepping in. This is not about a code of content. Well,

235
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:47,840
I have to say, code of conduct. It's an inkling of a piece of humanity. And I think that what has

236
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,240
to happen is we had, it has to get much, much worse than this before it can get any better. But

237
00:27:52,240 --> 00:28:00,800
it will get better because I believe that that's the evolutionary way. Maybe more about that

238
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,560
in the final thought of the week. Adams has David Peterson. I just received my sample of

239
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:12,720
lively Colombian Folgers gourmet selections today as heard about on the Daily Source Code. That's

240
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,840
right. Folgers is sponsoring a number of programs across the Pod Show podcast network. And

241
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,440
you can, if you live in the US, get a free sample. When I heard you talk about it, I was curious

242
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,800
because my experience with the taste of Folgers has not been very positive. I woke up this morning

243
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:35,040
and decided to try the Folgers. It was the most bitter coffee I have ever tasted. Worst, the McDonald's

244
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,360
coffee. I couldn't taste much difference between the gourmet selections and the gourmet,

245
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,280
Supreme Dark Roast that I had previously tried. I couldn't finish one cup. I had to pour it out

246
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,240
and make a pot of my regular and freshly ground French roast coffee. Now you should tell me what

247
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,800
what brand that is. I know you can't control the quality of the coffee, but since you're pimping

248
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,880
the coffee, I figured you might want to know about my experience with it. I won't be purchasing any,

249
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,040
but I'm happy for you and podcasting in general that Pod Show has the sponsorship deal with them.

250
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:13,440
Love the show. I'm a folder, not a folder. Dave Peterson. Who has his own website at dipstick.com.

251
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:20,720
Damn. Wow, this is what an amazing piece of feedback from the man who has dipstick.com.

252
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,640
Dave, absolutely. I really appreciate the feedback. We don't get a lot of negative feedback from

253
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,240
the audience about any of the products mentioned here on the show, whether they're paid for or not.

254
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:41,600
But I have sent this on. It's always fun. It's Greg the Sales Weasel and I forward to the

255
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,000
note to him and I said, dude, I'll be talking about this on the show. Let's talk to fulgers.

256
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,400
You know, what do they do when someone says that they hate their coffee? They don't like the taste.

257
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:57,200
I mean, I believe, you know, maybe you're making it in a funky way. Or let's find out what this

258
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,680
regular freshly ground French roast coffee is. I'd really love to know. So thank you for that.

259
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,160
And I assure you, we will get back to you 100% for sure.

260
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,960
I get getting a lot of email, just to kind of wrap up the week here. A lot of email and a lot of

261
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,360
messages about the cost of SMS texting. Now, this all stems from the conversation about Twitter

262
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,960
being such a runaway success. And my belief that it is particularly a success in the United States,

263
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,880
because people are actually now understanding how cool SMS text messaging is. I have to say SMS

264
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,040
text messaging. Because otherwise, it's not clear what's going on in the state. Do you know that I

265
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:45,520
asked our producer of, well, Lisa Aaron to produce his textra. She produces a number of shows for

266
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,160
she's working on the plus or 24 hour live video channel. Oops. That's something I shouldn't have.

267
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,600
I, you know, she, she wanted me to review a show. And I said, well, just send me a, send me an SMS

268
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,160
text message. I even use the American vernacular that I thought would make help or understand.

269
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,320
And I didn't hear anything for like an hour. And then she called and said, have you seen it?

270
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,840
Yes, it was waiting for a text message from you. He says, well, I pinged you on Skype. It said,

271
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,080
no, no, no, through your phone. I don't know how to do that. And she is brilliantly smart.

272
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,760
It's just not cultural yet. So that's why I think Twitter is exploding in the U.S.

273
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,040
Anyway, so part of the downside of these SMS text messages and this plays into me walking around

274
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,040
with my singular one account in the U.S. and here in Europe and the cost of receiving phone calls,

275
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:41,040
the cost of data, which is really just outrageous. I pay about it. I think it's a two dollars

276
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,600
and a megabyte downloaded or use perhaps up and down while I'm roaming. I mean, that's, that's

277
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:55,680
atrocious. And I claim that that receiving text messages when you're in roaming mode across borders

278
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,360
cost money. I know it does because I've paid the bills.

279
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:06,000
I had them 20 films here just listening to your conversation about JSM roaming. And I've been in

280
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
industry for quite a while and I've never heard of anyone being charged or receiving SMS. The point

281
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,040
is with calls. You can choose where I'm not, you want to receive calls on your roaming. I'm

282
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:25,040
using the director of firing. And SMS is no way of stopping SMS is coming in easily. So you could get

283
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,640
hundreds of SMSes while you're roaming. There's no way of stopping them so you could get charged.

284
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,240
So it's basically no fair charge for them. So it's part of the most company doing charge for

285
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,000
receiving SMS while you're roaming abroad. Okay. There's an okay folder.

286
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,960
Oh, yes. Well, despite the fact that you're a fellow folder, I have to disagree with you. And I looked

287
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:54,000
it up on the singular business page at singular.com. And they have all kinds of packages. I went

288
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,560
through every single one of them and here's the best and cheapest and most cost-effective package.

289
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:05,360
There's no other packages that excludes this. International text messages. Send international

290
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,400
text messages from the US to friends, family co-workers around the world. There is no monthly

291
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,080
charge to send or received international text messages. It is just 20 cents to send a message

292
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,200
from the US to international destinations and just 15 cents to receive one.

293
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:27,600
With a singular media bundle or messaging package, receiving a text message will be applied

294
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:35,440
to your package allowance. It costs money. It costs money to receive. Wow. Is this also

295
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,800
if you're just in the states? From the US to send a message from the US to international cost 20 cents.

296
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,720
Is this cost you money just to receive it from international? Look, I'm telling you, it's a scam

297
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:56,880
and it's messed up, okay? And it costs money. It does. And if you're on prepay, oh man, you get totally ripped

298
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:06,400
off. You're out. I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out. You're out. Please don't

299
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:17,120
bang that gavel. You can try this cowbell out. Let's all give a nod to the hardest work in the

300
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:27,120
wrong year. It's Jersey, it's Iowa, it's Jersey, it's Iowa. Yo, what's up, Adam? It's Jersey, Todd.

301
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,320
The official musicologist of the Chacha. Boy, oh, boy, boy. If there have been some big things

302
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,640
going on at the PMN this week. But I've got somebody for you for Food War Friday. They're just

303
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,280
really, really stuck in my head. The woman's name is genocide. She's out of Texas. She is the

304
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,560
flower of the east as they put it on her website. And I don't know who did what to her, but this girl

305
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,200
is really, really pissed off. But it's a good thing that she took it out in the song. Check this out,

306
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,640
it's I've had enough by genocide on Food War Friday.

307
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:24,640
And her in your hands. Now what's left is what it is.

308
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:38,320
Don't accuse me of blame me. You're the one you lied to me. You're the one who used me. I won't

309
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:53,920
give you my sympathy. I'll let you drag me down with you. I love you. I love you. I love you.

310
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:08,160
I know you will never be true. I love you. I love you. I love you.

311
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:23,600
I love you. I love you. I love you.

312
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:38,560
Sheala named girls you fought you. Now you fought me over you said it's me

313
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:53,360
you love the heart of you fought others. I want to drag me down with you I love

314
00:36:53,360 --> 00:37:03,360
I know you will never be true

315
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,360
I know you will never be true

316
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:19,360
I know you will never be true

317
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:45,360
I know you will never be true

318
00:37:45,360 --> 00:38:01,360
I know you will never be true

319
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:11,360
I know you will never be true

320
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:27,360
I know you will never be true

321
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:43,360
I know you will never be true

322
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:59,360
I know you will never be true

323
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:09,360
I know you will never be true

324
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:19,360
I know you will never be true

325
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:35,360
I know you will never be true

326
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:51,360
I know you will never be true

327
00:39:51,360 --> 00:40:07,360
I know you will never be true

328
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:23,360
I know you will never be true

329
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:39,360
I know you will never be true

330
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:49,360
I know you will never be true

331
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:19,360
I know you will never be true

332
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:47,360
I know you will never be true
