Hey, what are you building?

Of course, that's a lot of food bars.

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
We're going out to America and actually

00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,520
No candy, no candy for you

55
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,520
No candy, no candy

56
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
We're going out to America and actually

57
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
No candy, no candy for you

58
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520

00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,520
Oh, you got up

64
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,520
The fighting cocks

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
We got no candy for you

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,520
New world where TV networks, movie studios

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,520
And record labels

68
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Still think they can govern what you see in here

69
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,520
One man has the power to return control of entertainment

70
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,520
To the masses and make big media corporations

71
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Wet their tiny little pants

72
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,520
From Pod Show, home of the world's most dangerous new content

73
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Comes the Daily Source Code

74
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,520
With Adam Curry

75
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,520
Hell yeah

76
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
That's how we roll with it

77
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
Hey everybody, how you doing it is

78
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Food Bar Friday

79
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
We are officially fucked up beyond repair

80
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
It is the end of the week

81
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,520
And we celebrate that here on the Daily Source Code

82
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
With all kinds of stuff

83
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,520
And today it's going to be lots of music

84
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
Great music, thank you

85
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Surgeersy Todd, the official musicologist of the Charlie

86
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,520
For a tournament on to the fighting cocks

87
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,520
With no candy, that was twisted

88
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,520
But it was, I don't know, it was interesting

89
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,520
And it had that

90
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,520
What is it, it's a Glen Millenir

91
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,520
That it started off with very, very nice

92
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Hey, I had a, just a funky ass day

93
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,520
To wind up the week

94
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Well, of course, I'm kind of kind of

95
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Fibbing a little bit because it's Thursday night

96
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,520
Late to 1130

97
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
And by the time you're hearing this

98
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
In Los Angeles

99
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Meeting with lots of powerful people

100
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,520
But it is, forget it, it's food bar

101
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,520
So I had a really interesting day today

102
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,520
I got up at 730

103
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,520
Because I had a nine o'clock meeting at HQ

104
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,520
Of course, I had no production work to do

105
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,520
So doing that none of the evening schedule now

106
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
And I looked outside

107
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,520
It was pouring right

108
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
And so, you know, wait a little, I don't think

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Okay, I got a time this because

110
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
He's driving Trinity to keep it rolling

111
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,520
So we can get it on the road pretty soon

112
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
And make, you know, and

113
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Clearly, it's a kind of QA that Rosie is doing

114
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,520
It's like bug testing, you know, and so what if we replace now

115
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,520
The transmission, we've replaced that we fixed the gas tank

116
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,520
We've replaced the brakes

117
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,520
We've had two new fuel pumps installed

118
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,520
This behatch is ready to roll

119
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,520
For sure

120
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
So anyway, so you know me, I'm a hair guy

121
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,520
So I got, yeah, I do my hair

122
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,520
I take 20 minutes every day

123
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Nice and poofy

124
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,520
And I was like, okay, it's stop raining

125
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,520
I can't really see if it's stop raining

126
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,520
But I can see that the windshield wipers

127
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,520
Of the cars down on the Harrison

128
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Which is part of what I, I have 180 degree view

129
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,520
So Harrison is just one of the streets I see here

130
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
And I see the windshield wipers

131
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Either on intermittent or not on to like, okay, I'm making my move

132
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
I go outside within seconds it starts

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
So it's almost like hail

134
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,520
I'm like, oh man, and I have a ten minute, you know, eight or ten minute walk

135
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,520
Like this is not gonna, this is not gonna fly

136
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,520
So I stop underneath the overpass

137
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
Where many of my friends live

138
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
And open up my bag

139
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
And I had in there a plastic bag

140
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
From a Heathrow airport

141
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
From the new stand

142
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
It's what they put my magazines

143
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,520
I was by the pilot magazines at the airport

144
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,520
They always seem to have them at airports

145
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,520
And sure enough, it fit perfectly over

146
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
If it perfectly over my head

147
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,520
It was the perfect circumference, it wasn't a huge bag

148
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,520
And so it protected my head

149
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,520
It was like a clear plastic bag with some writing on like WH Smith or something

150
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
And it just got all poof beyond top

151
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,520
And no matter how I try to push it down

152
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
To make it like a shower cap

153
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
We're kind of poof up

154
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
So I said fuck it

155
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,520
And I just walking down second street here in San Francisco

156
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Like a six foot three smurf

157
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,520
And I'm looking at him window

158
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,520
He's going like, man, I look like a ridiculous retard

159
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
I'm sorry

160
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
Nothing against retards

161
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
But it's just like, that's what you would call it

162
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Total fucking idiot

163
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
Just pardon my French, but hey, it's football

164
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,520
And I notice that people don't even look at me

165
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Or they look at me

166
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
Nothing, nothing, no surprise

167
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,520
But I do think I should invest in an umbrella

168
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
That might not be a bad idea

169
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
I'm in DSC listeners around the globe

170
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
This is Robert and Toronto

171
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Post of the mobile movie podcast at mobilemovie.podshow.com

172
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
Who doesn't like Jeff Smith

173
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
I think his stuff is fantastic

174
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,520
I asked Jeff to do a jingle for the mobile movie podcast

175
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
We review movies right from our hot rod

176
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Many in and around the streets of Toronto

177
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Right after we've seen the movie

178
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Jeff said, what do you like?

179
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
I said, I like movies

180
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
I like driving music

181
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
What can you do?

182
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Just said, I've got just the idea for you

183
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Here it is, the Jeff Smith jingle

184
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
For the mobile movie podcast

185
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,520
Again, mobile movie.podshow.com

186
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Bring it on Jeff, you rock man

187
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
It's the best way to go

188
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Have to remove it

189
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,520
And we're going mobile and everywhere

190
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Go to flag out the highway

191
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
All the way down

192
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
I can bring it along

193
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
I say you there

194
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
We have to take it

195
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Not for a mission

196
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,520
And the mission is making it more or less

197
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Take it right

198
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
After the movie

199
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
After the movie

200
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Take it right

201
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,520
After the movie

202
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Driving on over to the right

203
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Holy crap, that's awesome

204
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Jeff Smith, once again

205
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Man, I love that

206
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,520
And while I heard that play and hold on a second

207
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
I was listening to that

208
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
And I'm like, oh man

209
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
I know what this is inspired on

210
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
I love Jeff Smith

211
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,520
He makes such catchy, hokey stuff

212
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,520
And always sounds like something else

213
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
But it isn't exactly the same

214
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
But that jingle sounded so much

215
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Like one of my favorite songs of all time

216
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
I just got to break my own format once again

217
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
I'm sorry

218
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,520
You will never learn anything about music

219
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,520
If we don't actually

220
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,520
You know, crap, almost

221
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Like I was so in tune with everything there

222
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Is that not mute?

223
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
No, okay

224
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
It was just a long intro

225
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
Let me see if it's working

226
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Do I have a plug in the right place here?

227
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
The hell was that?

228
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,520
Why is it so soft?

229
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
Oh, that's lame

230
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
That's working

231
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
Oh, man

232
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Oh, I see, I see the problem, okay

233
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,520
If you have

234
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
It's really sucks

235
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,520
If you have your earbuds really jammed in

236
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Tight then you already hurt

237
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Let's listen to the piece of that Jeff

238
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
The Jeff Smith jingle again

239
00:09:47,520 --> 00:10:06,520
Okay, now listen to this

240
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
This is what I want to do

241
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Originally like five minutes ago

242
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
My friend Dan Hartman with the

243
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
And going to grow

244
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,520
You want to perform music

245
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Come on, let me take you on a plane ride

246
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
The mountain is high

247
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,520
The valley is normal

248
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
And you are confused

249
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
But this way

250
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,520
So I can repeat

251
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Give you a hand

252
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
And lead you into

253
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
The promise plans

254
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Come on and take a free ride

255
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Come on and take a free ride

256
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Come on and take a free ride

257
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,520
Come on

258
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,520
Come on

259
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Come on

260
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Come on

261
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,520
Come on

262
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,520
Come on

263
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,520
All over the country

264
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Same in the same

265
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Nobody's waiting

266
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
This kind of game

267
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
We got a little dinner

268
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
It's time to be here

269
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
But you know all the answers

270
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Let's know about it

271
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Come on and take a free ride

272
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Come on and take a free ride

273
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,520
Come on and take a free ride

274
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Come on

275
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,520
All right

276
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
All right, it's enough of that

277
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,520
I love that song

278
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,520
I really really really miss Dan Hartman

279
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
Oh man, he was so awesome

280
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,520
Dan Hartman

281
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,520
You know, remember him from I can dream about you

282
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
And re-light my fire

283
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
And ah shit

284
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
I get on those Napster kicks man

285
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,520
And then you just you just can't help yourself

286
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
But look up

287
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
Artists and shit you can play

288
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Because you can play as much as you want

289
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Of course, it is easy for button to share that with you

290
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Let me say instant replay

291
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
We are the young

292
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
I can dream about you free ride

293
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Live it in America

294
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
He wrote for James Brown with another body of mine

295
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Charlie Midnight

296
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Keep the fire burning with a letter

297
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Halloway

298
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Cranky

299
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
And the loving your eyes

300
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Unfortunately, Dan passed away

301
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Of AIDS

302
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,520
I think in 1996

303
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
Maybe

304
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Yeah

305
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
90

306
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
No, there was a little bit later than that

307
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
98

308
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Anyway, thank god as music lives on

309
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
And if you would be so kind

310
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Is to go purchase a Dan Hartman song

311
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
At the music

312
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Music store of your choice

313
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,520
I would really appreciate it

314
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
Because

315
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,520
I believe that his estate

316
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,520
All proceeds from his from record sales

317
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
Go through his estate

318
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,520
And they go towards AIDS research

319
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,520
A speaking of buying stuff on iTunes

320
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
Hello

321
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
I'm just in the DSC

322
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
And I heard you mention

323
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
The drummer's the child thing

324
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I was thinking

325
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Will they count if people from different countries

326
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,520
By the actual album

327
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Would it be better real?

328
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Can we all buy from the US still without a US credit card?

329
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
I'm not sure

330
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I just wonder how it would affect the child

331
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
If people were buying from different countries

332
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Or how we could go about buying from the single countries

333
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
Are you not to say anything

334
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Anyway, as recent you tag it

335
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Now we're Wales investing

336
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
All right, thank you

337
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
All right, man, thanks

338
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Yeah, that's he's referring to bum rush the charts

339
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
You can find more information about it

340
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
bum rush the charts.blogspot.com

341
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
And it's kind of a cool idea

342
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,520
We're going to show the power of podcasting and pod safe music

343
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,520
And as many more pieces

344
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
I can plop through my microphone

345
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
We're going to do that on March 22nd

346
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,520
And just a plethora of podcasters

347
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,520
And independent audio producers, I'm my dad

348
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
We'll be placing links

349
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
And playing

350
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
I guess I'll be playing this song

351
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
That song by Black Lab

352
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
And the links will be to the iTunes music store

353
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,520
What we're going to do is try and get the song

354
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
To number one

355
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
March 22nd

356
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Very strategically chosen date

357
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
We don't believe there are any other releases

358
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,520
But we think it would be pretty interesting

359
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
If we could drive a song to number one

360
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
That that shows a pretty awesome power

361
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
So if you want to join that

362
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
I don't know where to

363
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
bum rush the charts.blogspot.com

364
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
Link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

365
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
So the question

366
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Yes, you have a different iTunes music store

367
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
For each country

368
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
Do the same thing in your country

369
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Let's see if we can do this by country

370
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
Maybe we'll see that Germany is

371
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
An example is really strong

372
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
And that Germany kicks ass

373
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
Doing that

374
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
I think the song is available on all music stores

375
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
I'll have to check on it

376
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Not entirely sure

377
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,520
But it's going to be a lot of fun

378
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
So the rest of the day

379
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Busy

380
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
Busy

381
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
And of course around 3 o'clock

382
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,520
I've got the big dip

383
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
The jet lag hits

384
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,520
But it was a day filled with beautiful women

385
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
For me

386
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Which is always enjoyable

387
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,520
The lovely Natalie Delcante

388
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
She came to the...

389
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
We have two offices

390
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
And one we're using is a studio for texture

391
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
If you have not seen her show

392
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
Please check out textra.podshow.com

393
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,520
T-E-X-T-R-A

394
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
It's good show

395
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
I like what I like the most about

396
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
She'll sit there

397
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
And she writes everything herself

398
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
And she does all the research

399
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
But she also gives her own opinion

400
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Which is nice

401
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,520
And I often find myself yelling

402
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Back at the screen

403
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
I disagree

404
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
Anyway

405
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
So it's so frazzled and so busy

406
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Didn't really have a chance to talk to her

407
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
But it's just nice

408
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
You know, smiling women around you

409
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,520
And Cali Lewis was from Dallas

410
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Visiting Podshow HQ

411
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,520
And Cali, Cali looking so good

412
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Let me tell you

413
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,520
You know how people look good on television

414
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Or on video

415
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
And then you see them in real life

416
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
And it's kind of a disappointment

417
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
They're really short

418
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Or the head's really big

419
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
Then a white has an enormous head

420
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
I'll let you know

421
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
So does Pat Say Jack

422
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
But anyway

423
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
When you see Cali

424
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
You know, you already

425
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Love her when you see her on Geek Brief

426
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
But in real life, man

427
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
It's just that there's an energy

428
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
There's a life force that emanates from her

429
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
That is quite enchanting

430
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
And I had dinner with her

431
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,520
And with Neil and with Richard

432
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,520
And the best part about it is

433
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
We made Richard pay

434
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:04,520
If you're tired of all those uptight award shows

435
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Then head on over to earmuffawards.com

436
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
And listen to the second annual

437
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Frat Packure Muffawards

438
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,520
This is the award show for fans of movies

439
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Like Caldiganites

440
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
The breakup

441
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Or you mean to pre

442
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Who will win the coveted awards for categories

443
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Such as best sex scene

444
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Best celebrity cameo

445
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Or the cheese

446
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
A award

447
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
For dubious distinction

448
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Featuring podcast personalities

449
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
From shows such as

450
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Five Honey by Midnight

451
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Podcast 411

452
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Film Spotting

453
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
The amateur traveler

454
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
The office alliance

455
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Big Barry

456
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
The metcast

457
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
That's what she said

458
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,520
And the Frat Pack tribute

459
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,520
The ceremony is broadcasting now at earmuffawards.com

460
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
I'm in

461
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
I love it

462
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Earmuffawards.com

463
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Great

464
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Yeah, Oscars this weekend

465
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
I'm definitely going to watch

466
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
I'm excited about it

467
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
Because

468
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Normally I wouldn't be able to watch that

469
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
Because it'd be on way too late

470
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
In the UK and then you see it the next day

471
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
And you already know who won everything

472
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Because you know it's all over the radio and the newspapers

473
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
And you know

474
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
So I'm going to make my own little party here

475
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
My own little Oscars party

476
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
For sure

477
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Hey, let me see

478
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
What else?

479
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Oh, yeah

480
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Let's talk

481
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
What should I talk?

482
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Do you want to talk about my Wi-Fi?

483
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Because I have some theories about this now

484
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,520
I had some problems with the

485
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
The condo is not small

486
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Certainly not small

487
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
But it's not

488
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
It's not palatial

489
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,520
So the Wi-Fi router

490
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
Which has always been in the same place

491
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Behind the

492
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Behind the big devol

493
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
That's a French for couch

494
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
My devol

495
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
And all of a sudden

496
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
There's a whole bunch of spots

497
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
Within the living area

498
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,520
That it just won't connect

499
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
It won't even see the network

500
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,520
I see other networks

501
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Really strong signals I might add

502
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Which of course is probably part of the problem

503
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
I've tried everything

504
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
I've tried switching all the channels

505
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,520
There's a huge amount of configuration options

506
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
You can set in these

507
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
And these de-link

508
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Wireless routers

509
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
I want them in bed

510
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
It works fine

511
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,520
And then the other weird problem

512
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
It'll connect to the network

513
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
But then it won't get signed

514
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
So for some reason now the DHCP

515
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Doesn't seem to work

516
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,520
But that's also dependent on where you're standing

517
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
So

518
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
I'm fairly convinced that there's just so much

519
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,520
Wireless activity in this city

520
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
And maybe even in this building

521
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
And maybe because of the height

522
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
That there's just too many signals

523
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
And it's got completely food bar

524
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
And here's an interesting thing

525
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
You might want to try this

526
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
I'd love to hear

527
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
I'd love

528
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
I don't know if you have a lot of signals where you live

529
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
Continuously

530
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
It's almost like the wind is blowing the signals in

531
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,520
And you see all these names show up

532
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,520
And it's kind of kind of interesting

533
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,520
Even though it's very very frustrating

534
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Not being able to connect right off the bat

535
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,520
And I have found by the way that if you let it sit long enough

536
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Eventually it will connect

537
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
I don't understand what's going on

538
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
But let me just read off some of the names

539
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Of these wireless access points

540
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
It's pretty interesting

541
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,520
We have two offices one I see here

542
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
Benbo 7

543
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Barney

544
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,520
He's Ms. Magda

545
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,520
This is my favorite brown town

546
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,520
I wonder what that is

547
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Winston

548
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,520
What kind of wireless networks are you seeing

549
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Where you live

550
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,520
That's an audio comment I wouldn't mind having

551
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
In fact

552
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Would you mind dialing it in?

553
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Here's a reminder of our phone number

554
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Us one two one six two five six three five seven

555
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:06,520
Us one two one six two five six three five seven

556
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Your honor

557
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
I'd like to make a motion

558
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,520
To rock this mother out

559
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Your honor

560
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,520
Please don't bang that gavel

561
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,520
You can try this cowbell out

562
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Let's all give a nod

563
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
To the hardest work

564
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
And law here

565
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,520
He's jerseys

566
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,520
He's jerseys

567
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Oh yeah

568
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520

00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520

The shot shot

573
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
And one of the criticisms that I hear

574
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
About the positive music network

575
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Is that people say

576
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
I don't know who this guy is

577
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
I don't know if I should play

578
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,520
Well that's not going to happen this week

579
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Because somebody posted about five or six amazing

580
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,520
Amazing songs

581
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
His name is Jeff Malon at a Philadelphia

582
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
And well he also posted

me side or rocket that is dude. I don't think I ever talked about anyone having the right

667
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,720
to shoot down anything but okay I'm glad you agree with me.

668
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,560
Coming from Iran towards USA. Here is a quote I'm quoting.

669
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:44,840
Poland and Czech Republic are situated directly along the shortest line between Iran and the

670
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:53,400
United States. If Iran were to develop and fire an intercontinental missile at

671
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,840
America. If you're going to shoot a missile, it should be an intercontinental one because we're all

672
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:04,040
part of the jet set these days. The two countries would be ideal locations for heating the

673
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:13,400
missile in mid-flight and quote. So you see that USA, USA wants to build installations with

674
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:21,080
interceptor missiles, missiles intercepting in these two countries. However, Russia says that it is

675
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:30,440
wrong because this interceptor missiles could hit Russia also. So Adam, you as American

676
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:40,200
could you tell Russians to calm down Spakoynoski and to allow USA to defend itself. I defend.

677
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:48,920
Otherwise, if Russians will not calm down, then a new arms race is cooking and then you can

678
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:55,160
forget about sucked up beyond repair Fridays and get ready for the workware.

679
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:01,000
That's it. Oh, you know. Always a high positive note for the end of the week there from

680
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,040
comic strip blogger. Yeah, no, I agree. Hey Vladimir Putin, chill dude. Although I can totally

681
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,680
understand. I mean, remember when Russia put missiles in Cuba, was there a minor freak out in

682
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:21,800
the United States? Yeah, I think so. Oh boy, the world is a bit foward. Anyway, when you see that video

683
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:29,240
and I do think I do hope you take a look at it. From, was it from video leak or something like that?

684
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,800
I can't remember what it was from. Anyway, it's an embedded video. When you look at that, you know,

685
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,320
and just reverse the roll for a second. Because these are clearly very with it.

686
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,920
Some very attractive, by the way, young people. And so if they're here in, you know, all this crap

687
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,560
about what America wants to do to them, just reverse the roll for a second. You'd be sitting there

688
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:57,640
having a drink saying, fuck that shit. Man, oh man, oh man. Hey, anyone out there in Iran,

689
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,560
give me a call. Let's talk about shit. Okay. I want a second. Here's what we should do.

690
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:13,240
Where is it? Oh boy, I'm so tired. Here it is. If you're from Iran, this is the closest number I have to your location.

691
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:21,720
Please give me a call. Plus four four, two, oh seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three,

692
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:28,920
plus four, four, two, oh seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three.

693
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,440
I don't know, Jim, I'm using fused stuff. I've just got an invite this morning and I've just installed it.

694
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,080
Me, this is the future, this, this is definitely the future of television.

695
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:49,560
Oh, I haven't gotten the invite to the minute, but if you don't already have one, give us a certain,

696
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:55,240
if I do get one, I'll certainly send you a link about the help. This is fantastic.

697
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:04,680
Hi, man. You know, I do not have an invite for the beta. I did send off my email address to get one,

698
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:11,320
but I got no juice. I did see the interface briefly today on texture. Natalie Delcante has an

699
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,880
invite and she showed some of the interface. Looks really slick, man. Definitely. Would you mind sending

700
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,920
one to me? I'd appreciate it. And my prayers have indeed been answered. The news is official.

701
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:28,120
And of course, all the technology presses picking this up is what is the headline I read?

702
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,240
Oh, Google takes a swipe at Microsoft because they have the Google Premiere edition.

703
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:41,160
Yeah. That means for your own domain, you can get Gmail, multiple accounts, all the apps like

704
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:48,520
a docs, calendars, scheduling software, all as web service. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

705
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,720
If the stock was not already, like 4,500 bucks, I'd buy more. So expensive.

706
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:03,000
50 bucks gives you, um, it doesn't say how many accounts you can create for that,

707
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:11,000
but you do get 10 gigabytes per account. Hey, finally, for only 50 bucks a year, fantastic. So Sunday,

708
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,480
before I get ready for the, for the Oscars, I'm going to have a Google Premiere edition

709
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,800
party for myself. I'm going to set up Curry.com with Google Premiere edition. And the reason why I

710
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,400
really have to take some time is because, you know, besides all these MX records and shit,

711
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,040
you got to set up. I have a lot of email accounts that, you know, like Patricia's, my sister,

712
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:35,080
you know, there's a lot of stuff that I have to make sure it works. This one guy, um, whose name is, I think,

713
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,640
Tom Curry. I think it's Tom. And, uh, geez, I've known this guy virtually for,

714
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:52,120
I'm going to say, since 1993, something like that when I got Curry.com. And, uh,

715
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,760
he, I remember sending him an email and he said, hey, you know, my name's Tom Curry. I would

716
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,120
really love to have Curry.com email address. And, uh, would you hook me up? Can you hook a brother up?

717
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,000
I said, yeah, absolutely. And, uh, so once, you know, once every couple of years will send me a note

718
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,840
and say, hey, man, is, is the server okay? Because I haven't been receiving anything and

719
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:18,680
a couple times something has been broken. Um, but, uh, I'm, I'm looking forward to putting all that

720
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,840
together. That's going to be cool. Very, very cool. All right. Let's see, Fubar Friday on the daily

721
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:31,160
source code continues. Uh, only one more, uh, one more, um, comment here and another kick-ass song.

722
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:37,480
So let's get ready for that weekend. Hello, Adam. It's Martin, aka GD from GD's by size bonus.

723
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,400
As you know, I do a music podcast for five days a week. And I'd like to keep my finger on the

724
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,560
pulse of what's happening in the music scene. One of the bands that really is ripping up the

725
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,840
polysphere of the moment, the band called Bella Donna. Now, they've done great things on my space,

726
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,640
um, they have a blog on there, molest every day. They always communicate with the fans. Like I said,

727
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,040
they're on the PLM as well. They're very crafty on there. They put songs up there and they'll even

728
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,360
they're a couple of months taking down, put some fresh ones up. Now, the good news is they're

729
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,320
coincidentally UK. Now, come all the way from Italy to the UK on March the 5th.

730
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,760
If we down in Camden at the Underworld, the legendary Underworld, uh, let's see, such big

731
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,760
names as Radiohead Smashing Pumpkins, placebo, sound garden, crambles, food fighter,

732
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,560
squid and stone age, out the list just goes on and on. They've been invited over by a US

733
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,600
rock band hydrogen to play this date as special guests. Now then, I've been looking down

734
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,080
at Bella Donna on the PLN to see who's played them and you know something there's one

735
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:39,400
name missing. Yours, so come on Adam, get your finger out and play some Bella Donna,

736
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:45,000
and also just the side thing, think B.T. Potio, pay for me to go and see them. Okay, take care, Adam.

737
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:56,440
This is sound of Bella Donna, and so he called Black Swan.

738
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:18,680
I'll let you for my departure, record for my broken dreams. I will survive.

739
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:33,080
That's why I owe you all the soul of the ladies. That's why I owe you all the spirit of

740
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:44,440
play. Free will be so much so high. That's why I owe you all the right.

741
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,440
It's like your fuzz and whirling victim. There's a feather lamp of God.

742
00:34:51,800 --> 00:35:01,320
Oh my God, and none. All the spectacles of my reaction. My revenge was soon enough for

743
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:15,320
my war return. That's all. We're tough to still fight. That's all.

744
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:28,280
Oh my God, I'll survive. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna hold somebody. That's all.

745
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Oh my God, I'm gonna die.

746
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:14,280
That's all. I owe you all the soul of the ladies. That's all.

747
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:44,040
Free will be so much I have no idea how I miss that one. Bella Donna Black Swan

748
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:58,280
at the end of another week of the Charlie it's Friday.

749
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,160
You know, I had this whole final thought of the week thing. I'll set up and then

750
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,240
I'm just in a whack-down mood today, man. I haven't gotten my fix of old school music. I must be

751
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,200
something like that. I was just thinking, what is my final thought of the week?

752
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,120
I was gonna say something really philosophical, but I'm an old guy now.

753
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:26,040
Remember when you when your parents turn 40 and you were like crap, my parents are old. Okay,

754
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:32,280
so now I'm 40, 40, 42 actually. And I guess that since I was surrounded by women today,

755
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,800
I just want to say that you can find something beautiful in every single woman in the world.

756
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:45,240
Aren't women fantastic creatures? I mean, and it's, and it's not about how they, you know,

757
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:51,160
it's not if someone's pretty or ugly or that's not what I'm talking about. There's just something

758
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,440
about the creature that is woman that fascinates me. And I just want to dedicate today's

759
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:02,680
football Friday to all the women in the world. Oh, you know, that reminds me of another song,

760
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:14,120
a second. I'm so out of control. Hold on a second. So, as I was doing that,

761
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:21,240
that final thought of the week. Yeah, baby. Oh, I'd like to have a good one.

762
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,760
And I love all the paintings of the world.

763
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:38,200
And my name is Ralph, now I like a woman who loves her freedom. And I like a woman who can hold her on.

764
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:45,400
And if you feel that description being, come with me. I know all the lyrics of this song.

765
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,960
Take my hand. Come with me, baby. To love, man.

766
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:01,080
Let me show you how sweet it could be.

767
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:15,560
She and I that will me. I want you to love, throw it on. Come with, come with, come with, throw it on.

768
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,480
Aquarius or Libra, Libra?

769
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,560
And my name is Charles. Hey, Charles.

770
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:33,720
Now I like a woman that's quiet. A woman who carries a stuff like Miss Universe. Miss Universe.

771
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:59,000
And let me show you how sweet it could be. She and I that will me.

772
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,120
I want you to love, throw it on. All that, a boy band should show cover the song.

773
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,520
Interhead, I guarantee it.

774
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
Okay, I'll leave.

775
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:28,680
My name is Paul. Paul's Paul. I said, I like all the women of the world. That's right, Paul. I'm with you, my brother.

776
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,840
If you have a stand where I'm saying, I'll taste it.

777
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,720
Here I come.

778
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,360
Okay, let's do the chorus one more time.

779
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:14,040
Cancer. And my name is Larry. Yeah. And I like a woman that loves everything.

780
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:20,920
And everybody in everybody. Yeah, Larry. And you know what, ladies, if you feel that this is you,

781
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,120
then this was what I want you to do.

782
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,560
Yeah.

783
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:39,560
Take my hand. Let me take you to the land.

784
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,960
All right, I'm not officially sick of myself singing.

785
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,480
Did you fast forward that bit? I'm sorry. I don't blame you. All right, everybody. That's it.

786
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,480
That's the final thought of the week. And that's it for the Daily Source Code for this week.

787
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:57,000
Of course, I'm going to be here throughout the weekend. And I shall also be here up until

788
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:02,840
Thursday. Yeah, Thursday of next week. And then we go back to the Currie Manor, which will be nice again,

789
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:08,840
because I got to love the lady there as well. So let me, what the hell was that?

790
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,640
Man, someone in Europe is up really, really early.

791
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,880
Let me just get this. I want to do it right.

792
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,680
Okay, here we go. Thank you, PD Love, by the way, for all the fantastic openings.

793
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
