1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It was $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Warning. The content of this show is for mature audiences only.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's not work safe, or family safe, or carpool safe, or even safe to be listened to in daylight.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's not boat safe, walking the dog safe, and certainly not safe for anyone with a pacemaker.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's not safe for your pets, for the morbidly obese, or for people who live in fear of chimichangas.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's not safe for alcoholics, nor is it bathroom safe, kitchen safe, and certainly not safe for trainees.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
At least for the moment.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This show is not being inserted into any bodily orifice, though anyone doing so should wait at least 20 minutes before going into the water.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And last of all.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
For the next five days, this show is mined bitches, so drop your cocks and grab your socks.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is the Daily Source Code.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
With Mark Yoshimodo Nemkoff.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're listening to the Daily Source Code with Mark Yoshimodo Nemkoff.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Some people in our government, they want to regulate.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Don't we get to think of how I try to masturbate slowly, they erode.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
All right, the choice while people like us, we ain't got no voice, they ain't think we don't know.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Think we don't see.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Motherfuckers, they all lie at the media about why, on a water date, or in their rack, tell me how the fuck do I get my country back from.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Pretty long, because you don't give a fuck, sir, for how to get rich and how to make a fuck.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Time for us to call them motherfuckers.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But you can't just open your window and chat for this fuck, that fuck you fuck, bro.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I burn a fuck and take your dog and police show.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm here for a scene, a little unkind, but it's time for me to say what's on my mind, yo.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But casting is a new revolution.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Podcasting is the new revolution.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Podcasting is the new revolution.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Get off your ass, be part of the solution.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Podcasting is the new revolution.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Podcasting is the new revolution.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Podcasting is the new revolution.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Podcasting is the new revolution.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Criminal radio is just noise pollution.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Clip channel, motherfuckers suck as well.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
10, because a bro premise of a damn Paris Hilton.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Same fucking songs off fucking day long.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I've run the dirt no water, I had to, I'm curious, bond, then listen to that shit.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I need something fresh, I'm gonna give this boy a little goose flesh.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Gotta make it at home, turn on the microphone.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She's blowing up bigger than the Chinese Indra.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
When I'm up in my mouth, I get myself in trouble.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Like I get a fuck hell, I ain't a Mr. Bottle trying to keep this shit clean.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That ain't my fucking deal, say why don't I walk?

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How I feel keeping it fucking real?

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Clip channel, you can lick my balls if you think you own those kids in the malls.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Cause less people listen to you every day, so maybe hit my word when I fucking say yo.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Podcasting is a new revolution.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Podcasting is the new revolution.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Corporate radio is just noise pollution.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Podcasting is the new revolution.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000

Podcasting is a new revolution

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000

Podcasting is a new revolution

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Podcasting is a new revolution

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We're not эту a new revolution

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This seems to be shocking

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But all you need to do is tell me

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I gotta tell you it's pretty nice

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Welcome to the Daily Source.

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm gonna call up for the next week

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:18,300
The Daily Cold

106
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Everybody okay?

107
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,300
Oh, no, no, no.

108
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,300
Keep fucking, you okay duck taped.

109
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Hold on.

110
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
Alright, that's better.

111
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,300
Alright, well, uh, tell you what, we're gonna keep Adam locked up in a safe place for the next few days.

112
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,300
We're gonna put him in the closet.

113
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Jesus, fancy fucking shit, you got there.

114
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,300
It's one hell of a closet, Adam.

115
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,300
They're probably ventilation, right?

116
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,300
I guess, I will, well, whatever.

117
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,300
Okay, so, uh, okay, we got 18 more minutes to kill.

118
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Just kidding.

119
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,300
If you're listening to us on series stars one or two,

120
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,300
you're like, what the fuck is fucking, what,

121
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,300
but don't worry about it, just play along.

122
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,300
So, it's moments like this.

123
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,300
Or ask myself, oh, what would Jesus do?

124
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,300
And though the answer may involve, uh, some kind of a lap dance.

125
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Uh, I'll just defer to what would Adam do?

126
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,300
Well, Adam would probably do a story, right?

127
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Well, you're not getting what?

128
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,300
No, I'm just kidding.

129
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,300
I saw this the other day on, um, was ABC News?

130
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Does it fucking matter?

131
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,300
I saw this on the news.

132
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,300
And I had to do with, uh, music and piracy.

133
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Now, um, that's kind of interesting.

134
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
So I re-wound the tempo and I plugged in, I think.

135
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
That doesn't really matter.

136
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,300
So I plugged in my iPod kind of,

137
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,300
uh, with the dongle and the thingy and the thing that goes here.

138
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,300
And I thought I'd, uh, you know, take the audio.

139
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,300
And I'd play it for you.

140
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
Check this out.

141
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,300
They used to be the music industry's best customers.

142
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Now, they're rates biggest pirates, college kids.

143
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Instead of buying songs for 99 cents each legally

144
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,300
on sites like iTunes, the internet has given them instant access

145
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
to free music.

146
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,300
It seems so easy that it's almost not like stealing.

147
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,300
You basically illegally download all your music?

148
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
I, not all of it.

149
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,300
But most of it, say these university of southern California students,

150
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,300
even though the recording industry has sent threatening letters here.

151
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,300
So these letters don't scare you.

152
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,300
No matter what they do, it's never going to stop completely.

153
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,300
See for yourself how big the problem is.

154
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,300
You're watching a real-time readout of eelsongs and other entertainment media.

155
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
People are seeking out for free online right now.

156
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,300
They go buy in the hundreds per second.

157
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,300
Request for Buddy Holly, Miles Davis, Avril Levine.

158
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
These are big numbers.

159
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
We're looking out here.

160
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Yeah, they're terrifying numbers to the recording industry.

161
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,300
Eric Garland has big champagne, a research group that tracks illegal traffic.

162
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,300
Today alone, 137,000 times.

163
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,300
For every song that is downloaded legally.

164
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,300
How many are downloaded illegally?

165
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,300
At least very conservatively, at least 20.

166
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold the fuck on.

167
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
Did he just say 20?

168
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,300
That's right, 20 to one.

169
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,300
It took iTunes five years to sell two billion songs.

170
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,300
But there are a billion illegal downloads.

171
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,300
I guess it's music for free.

172
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,300
It gets its music online and gets its music without permission.

173
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,300
That's broken.

174
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
That is not a marketplace.

175
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,300
And if the music industry can't find a solution,

176
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,300
it's looking more and more like the song is over.

177
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,300
Anthony Mason, CBS News, Los Angeles.

178
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,300
CBS News, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

179
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,300
And you may have heard there were a couple of like little parts of our cutout.

180
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
That wasn't me editing the thing.

181
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
I was just a fault in the recording.

182
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
There's some reason my iPod skipped.

183
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
Well, whatever, it doesn't matter.

184
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,300
But I think you got the gist of the whole story.

185
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,300
According to this company, big champagne.

186
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,300
Some fucking consultant to the RIA,

187
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,300
which I believe stands for really ignorant arrogant assholes.

188
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,300
So this fucking consultant company is claiming

189
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:30,300
that songs are pirated at a rate of 20 to 1 versus songs being purchased legally.

190
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Now I gotta say, as a pretty outrageous numbers.

191
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,300
But am I really surprised?

192
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,300
That's the fucking question.

193
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,300
But honestly, I guess it really doesn't fucking matter

194
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
if I believe that or not.

195
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,300
What really matters is that the really ignorant arrogant assholes

196
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
believe it.

197
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300
And you better believe they do.

198
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,300
Especially that douchebag, Doug Morris,

199
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
who runs the Universal Music Group.

200
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
That's right, Doug.

201
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
I called you a fucking douchebag.

202
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Do something about it.

203
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,300
So here's the thing.

204
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,300
Now, when we were doing bummerish the chart,

205
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,300
I'm not gonna tell you, I hope bummerish the thing.

206
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
I know we've talked this to death,

207
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
but here's one thing I wanted to mention.

208
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,300
You know, we're a lot of people who were like,

209
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
I'm thinking about, can't you,

210
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
DRM and blah, blah, blah, blah.

211
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
And the funny thing was,

212
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,300
I noticed on dig.com,

213
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
when there was a like 1,500,

214
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,300
1,800 comments, whenever that one day.

215
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
There were a number of people who were like,

216
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,300
yeah, man, DRM is wrong, man,

217
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,300
and I'm not gonna do it because of DRM.

218
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,300
And yeah, man, and you know what?

219
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,300
Fuck you, because I downloaded it off a lime wire.

220
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,300
So their whole thing was, they were anti DRM,

221
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,300
because it prevented them from actually

222
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,300
pirating the song.

223
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Right, which is about as fucking stupid

224
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
as being one of these pro-life nut jobs

225
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,300
who has to kill an abortion doctor

226
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
to prove their point.

227
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,300
That fetus got her at to live,

228
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
which is why I'm gonna shoot you.

229
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,300
You would abortion, perform a doctor.

230
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,300
The world is full of stupid people.

231
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,300
Just look around you on the bus

232
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
or the cubicle next to you.

233
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,300
That guy, see that guy?

234
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,300
That guy picks his nose and eats it.

235
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,300
And you know what struck me the other day?

236
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,300
Well, the frying pan that my wife threw.

237
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:26,300
But after that, I was thinking about the grateful dead.

238
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
Now, you got to understand.

239
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,300
I can't fucking stand the grateful dead.

240
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,300
But I was thinking about something.

241
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,300
The grateful dead had one of the most amazing,

242
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,300
well, they still do, I guess, right?

243
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
They kind of tore right?

244
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,300
Jerry Garcia out in a glass coffin, right?

245
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
Or something, I don't know.

246
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,300
But they had this audience deadheads

247
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,300
that followed them to the ends of the earth

248
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
out of their own pockets.

249
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,300
Sure, you know, they were like 15 of them sleeping in van

250
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
and unwashed.

251
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,300
But this is an audience of deadheads

252
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,300
that marketing cannot buy.

253
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,300
And it's actually something that Pearl Jam is doing now.

254
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,300
So the grateful dead.

255
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:21,300
They have this huge loyal following.

256
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:27,300
And one of the things that they did was allow their fans

257
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,300
from the very beginning mind you.

258
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
They allowed their fans.

259
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Raise your hand if you know where this is going.

260
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,300
They allowed their fans to taper cord concerts.

261
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
That's right.

262
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Now, I know that, you know, every two dead songs,

263
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
they all sound alike to me.

264
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,300
And apparently, you know, any two concerts are different

265
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,300
because the way, you know, they go from sugar magnolia

266
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,300
and the trucking and blah, blah, blah, who fucking cares?

267
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,300
But the point is that the grateful dead

268
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,300
basically gave you cart blanche to tape

269
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,300
and swap their material.

270
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,300
And they said, be free.

271
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,300
You flower children, smelly people.

272
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,300
And this was file sharing, right?

273
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,300
This was hippie file sharing with, you know,

274
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
with sneaker net.

275
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,300
And they would trade cassettes in real-to-real tapes

276
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,300
and whatever those old fucking hippies used to record shit on.

277
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,300
You know, wax cylinder, I don't fucking know.

278
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,300
But that was a huge part of being a deadhead.

279
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Well, that and dropping acid and ending up naked

280
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,300
with some fat chick, but the whole point is

281
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,300
they had an amazing audience

282
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
that they let pirate their own material

283
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,300
and the audience just became more loyal.

284
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
And you're asking yourself,

285
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,300
would this work for Chris Dodtree?

286
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Would this work get a Chris Dodtree concert?

287
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
The answer is probably no,

288
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
because, you know,

289
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,300
teaching a young teenage girl how to operate a tape recorder.

290
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
You probably have a better chance

291
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,300
teaching a dog to read.

292
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,300
But that is not the point.

293
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
The point is that record companies

294
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,300
still think that you're ripping them off.

295
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
And you know what?

296
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,300
I want to hear what you think about it.

297
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,300
So this is what you're going to do.

298
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
You're going to send me some feedback.

299
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,300
And email it to me at where is Adam Curry at gmail.com

300
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,300
where you could also send it to Adam Curry's gay

301
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,300
at gmail.com.

302
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,300
It's your choice.

303
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,300
I'm leaving that up to you.

304
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
That's the kind of guy I am.

305
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,300
And since I can't figure out for the life of me,

306
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,300
how to access Adam's voice mail here.

307
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
Hold on.

308
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Let me give it another shot.

309
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
We're sorry.

310
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,300
You'll call.

311
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Cannot be completed.

312
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,300
Fuck.

313
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,300
All right. Whatever.

314
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
So for the time being this week,

315
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,300
call the PCH Commonline at 1-800-875-09995.

316
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Like I said, I want to hear from you.

317
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,300
You better call.

318
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
I know where you live.

319
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Hold on.

320
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
There's some stuff here on Adam's laptop.

321
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,300
Hold on.

322
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,300
What's this?

323
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Oh.

324
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Okay.

325
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Hello, Adam.

326
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,300
This is a prolific program.

327
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,300
I've been trying to catch up on some of the oldest sort of code

328
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,300
just from back before I discovered your podcast.

329
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,300
I just wanted to give you some information you asked about

330
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,300
in one of your oldest shows.

331
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Back on your DST-234,

332
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,300
you asked if it was possible to stream pornography

333
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,300
from your iPod.

334
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,300
If it was sitting and home connected to your desktop,

335
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,300
I wrote a utility that you could do that with.

336
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,300
You have to use a C++ compiler under Linux

337
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,300
on your home machine for it to work.

338
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,300
I have all the source code in the small library

339
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,300
even crude files that you need in my website.

340
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,300
I need to warn you that there are pictures on my website

341
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,300
of my operation.

342
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,300
So if you're at all squeamish about seeing bloody genitals

343
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,300
and various operative stages,

344
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,300
then I think you should avoid looking at picture number

345
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,300
for number 9 and then 11 through 46.

346
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,300
From 47 on, I'm pretty much healed.

347
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,300
The C files and the H files in the make files are all at

348
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:51,300
HTT-P-Colent-4-4-4-3-8.113.169.238.222.2-4-4-8

349
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:57,300
overcase P overcase P over slash question mark

350
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,300
and present Sparvanoxia,

351
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,300
built just like it sounds forward slash

354
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Goodbye Adam.

355
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
I don't know about you,

356
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,300
but I was on the edge of my city,

357
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,300
but I was on the edge of my city,

358
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,300
but I was on the edge of my city,

359
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,300
but I was on the edge of my city,

360
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,300
but I was on the edge of my city,

361
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,300
but I was on the edge of my city the whole time.

362
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,300
You know, standing there with a rope around my neck

363
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,300
tied to a beam that I know will support my body weight,

364
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,300
but nonetheless, on the edge of my city.

365
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
Hold on, what's that?

366
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,300
Oh, I think I hear Adam, hold on.

367
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
Dude, dude.

368
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
What?

369
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:54,300
No, I tap, tap against the door.

370
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,300
No, tap once, okay, okay.

371
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300
You're there in there, right?

372
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,300
Tap once for yes?

373
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
And tap twice for no.

374
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
Okay, I have no idea

375
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
with three times means.

376
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,300
Hold on, I'm going to have to check on this.

377
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Dude, I heard you lagged

378
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Godfather or the podfather or something,

379
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
and I got a URL that I want.

380
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,300
People is not checking out,

381
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
but no one's even to come to me.

382
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,300
I don't know why.

383
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,300
You go to www.3wafuckpapy.com.

384
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,300
It's a nickname, man, I'm a gaming when I was four,

385
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
and I don't know why no one will come to my site.

386
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
But I'd really like if you had the attention

387
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
to come on, man, you come on.

388
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Do you waifuckpapy.com?

389
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
It's a great URL.

390
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
I've had a shit with God daddy

391
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
and used your code and everything.

392
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,300
But nobody come.

393
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Nobody comes to the site.

394
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,300
And I really wasn't visible.

395
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
So if you can pay attention,

396
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
I'd appreciate it.

397
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,300
But I know I understand if you won't

398
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
because you're a busy guy.

399
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
I mean, if I had a hard job

400
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
to try to be fast cars

401
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
and playing the casual.

402
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
But in your hack all the way.

403
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,300
To www.3wafuckpapy.com

404
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:23,300
Thank you pod, person, poor people, whatever you are.

405
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,300
And...

406
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,300
I gotta go.

407
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Bye.

408
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,300
You heard the guy.

409
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,300
Go to www.3wafuckpapy.com.

410
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Why do you want that is?

411
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,300
But if you find pictures of Hillary there,

412
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
just don't blame me.

413
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,300
So...

414
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,300
If you find naked pictures of Hillary there,

415
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
don't blame me.

416
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
Hi, am I ruining your daily source code

417
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
listening experience yet?

418
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,300
Anyway, Adam's okay.

419
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
He's okay.

420
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
He just had to hit him a couple of times

421
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,300
with the cattle prod.

422
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
What the...

423
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Yeah.

424
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Funny thing was, I didn't even bring the cattle prod.

425
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
It was something that I found here on the desk.

426
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
And I never actually seen a cattle prod

427
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
with a rubber foulus on the end of it.

428
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
But you know.

429
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,300
Hey.

430
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,300
Whatever flow to boat.

431
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,300
All right, hold on.

432
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
Let's see what else is on Adam's laptop here.

433
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Ooh.

434
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,300
Ooh.

435
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,300
Ooh.

436
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,300
Check?

437
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,300
Oh yeah.

438
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Another one of the savants.

439
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Oh, dig it.

440
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
What?

441
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Okay.

442
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Hold on.

443
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,300
Let me click on here.

444
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Comics strip.

445
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Comics strip.

446
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Comics strip.

447
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Comics strip.

448
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
Comics strip.

449
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
Comics strip.

450
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,300
comics strip.

451
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,300
And um, it's comics strip luck here.

452
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
I am so pissed off today.

453
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,300
You know that thing where they say, there are two scoops of raisins and every box of raisin brand.

454
00:20:53,300 --> 00:21:00,300
There is only one scoop. Those bastards only give me one scoop of raisins and pisses me off. I'm so pissed off.

455
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,300
And I'm you sock, you're the only one who pays attention to me.

456
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:17,300
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip.

457
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:22,300
I don't know. Was that the real comic strip blogger?

458
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:30,300
I'm not sure, because I know that Adam's been working on a project, comic strip blogger, the musical,

459
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,300
and it's going to be cast entirely with hairless young boys.

460
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,300
So I don't know if that was a fuck.

461
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,300
I better ask him when he regains consciousness.

462
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Oh, it sucks. The only savant we didn't hear from was a nylon.

463
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Hold on. Let me check.

464
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:54,300
This laptop fucking porn, porn, porn, okay.

465
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

466
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
Oh, sweet.

467
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Let's have a word with the nylon.

468
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Spreading the news with the smile on, where the roll is right.

469
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,300
Ringo for light. Let's listen roll a while to the nylon.

470
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
Hold on. Did anybody else understand that?

471
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,300
I just...

472
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,300
I couldn't make out what nylon was saying, because it sounded like he had something in his throat,

473
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,300
something deep, something big and hairy, deep within his throat.

474
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,300
I hope it wasn't an important message. I kind of doubt it.

475
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:39,300
But so, hey, if you're not listening to bone, what the fuck are you thinking?

476
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Go to bone.podshow.com.

477
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Bone is this really great game show that I created for Pod Show.

478
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,300
It's a trivia game show, and I got to tell you.

479
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,300
If you're in a trivia, if you like stuff like this, it's a lot of fun.

480
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,300
And our good buddy Luke from Nokia, and we're giving away Nokia N800s,

481
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,300
as the grand prize on bone, an episode three through six.

482
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,300
I was just fucking blown away by this, because I have one of these things I have an N800,

483
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
and it's fucking amazing.

484
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
I mean, I use this thing actually.

485
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:14,300
I write Shadow Falls Badlands on an N800, using the on screen keyboard.

486
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,300
Believe it or not, I lie in bed at night.

487
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,300
And I sit there, and I write this thing, boom, boom, boom, boom,

488
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
and then I email it to myself.

489
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Yeah, just like that, boom, boom, boom, boom, and email it to myself.

490
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,300
And then in the morning, I have this document, and I just cut and paste it in there,

491
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,300
and just, you know, fix my typos and stuff.

492
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,300
But there it is.

493
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,300
Instead of journaling into a, you know, notebook with a paper and pencil,

494
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,300
I have all my stuff there.

495
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
I don't have to recap it.

496
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,300
It's fucking amazing.

497
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,300
I love my N800, and we're giving away these fucking things on bone.

498
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
I am so psyched about that.

499
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,300
So check it out, bone.podshow.com.

500
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Oh, shit.

501
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Hold on, the satellite window is coming to a close.

502
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,300
Hey, serious one or two listeners, you're just going to have to go to dailysourceco.podshow.com.

503
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,300
And trust me, I'm going to be back here tomorrow.

504
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Fucking up the joint again.

505
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Oh, yes, they're gone.

506
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Now it's just us alone.

507
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,300
You look so nice in that.

508
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
That thing you're wearing.

509
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
Yeah.

510
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
Here we're to like a drink.

511
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,300
What do you mean, no?

512
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300
Have a drink.

513
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Please.

514
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
No, I insist.

515
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
Have a drink.

516
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,300
No.

517
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Drink it.

518
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,300
I don't care if there's a busy tablet at the bottom of it.

519
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Drink it.

520
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Oh my god.

521
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,300
I just flashed back to my last date.

522
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
Oh shit.

523
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Oh.

524
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
Oh, these meds.

525
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
I'm on.

526
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,300
Oh, I got to tell you.

527
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,300
I got to fix this shit before it.

528
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
Oh, look, my pants are wet.

529
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Okay.

530
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,300
Well, I guess I better wrap things up here.

531
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
Tell you what.

532
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
You know what I'm going to play for you today?

533
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,300
I had a couple of different ideas.

534
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
What song I was going to play at the end of the show.

535
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,300
But if you're a PCH listener,

536
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,300
that's my regular show.

537
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,300
Just if it goes to all I.

538
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
If you're a PCH listener,

539
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,300
you already know that I'm a huge Kevin Gilbert fan.

540
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Now for those of you who don't know Kevin Gilbert.

541
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,300
Kevin was actually the guy who discovered Cheryl Crow.

542
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,300
That's the best shorthand I can give you.

543
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,300
He had this band at the time called Toy Matinee,

544
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
which you may or may not remember.

545
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,300
They had a couple of, it a couple of hits at the time.

546
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,300
You know, last playing out,

547
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,300
turning it on Salvador.

548
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,300
You know, we're talking like early 90s.

549
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,300
So when they were putting together the touring band for Toy Matinee,

550
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,300
which actually, well, that's a long story.

551
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,300
The keyboard player that they auditioned,

552
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
one of the keyboard players,

553
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,300
was a young lady named Cheryl Crow.

554
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,300
And Cheryl didn't get the gig,

555
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,300
but basically Kevin started to happener.

556
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
And they started dating and,

557
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,300
here's the true story.

558
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,300
Kevin had this group of friends that would get together,

559
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,300
you know, very well known.

560
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Well, for LA, I guess, well known.

561
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,300
A session, guys.

562
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,300
And they'd all get together once a week,

563
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,300
and you know, smoke a little and hang out and play in right tunes.

564
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,300
And they did it on Tuesday night.

565
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,300
And it was called the Tuesday night music club.

566
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,300
And Kevin invited Cheryl to come hang out with the boys,

567
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,300
you know, jam and stuff.

568
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,300
And then what happened was they ended up writing a bunch of songs

569
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,300
that she got a deal with.

570
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,300
And then, including all I want to do,

571
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,300
her first big hit, which Kevin co-wrote

572
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,300
and co-one the Grammy on.

573
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,300
And then what happened was, well,

574
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
it got kind of ugly from there,

575
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,300
because Cheryl started to become a big star

576
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,300
and her promise to help Kevin get a record deal

577
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,300
didn't quite pan out,

578
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,300
because she basically told him to fuck off.

579
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,300
And so it ended pretty badly.

580
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,300
And what really happened was Kevin,

581
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,300
Kevin co-wrote.

582
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,300
Like all the songs on the record.

583
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,300
And what I heard is that he wrote

584
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,300
almost all the songs on her record.

585
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,300
But he gave songwriting credit to the other guys

586
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,300
in the Tuesday night music club,

587
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,300
who all ended up being in Cheryl's band

588
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,300
and recording the record with her,

589
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
because that was the kind of guy he was.

590
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
And I can vouch for Kevin Gilbert

591
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,300
because I went to school with Kevin Gilbert

592
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
at Berkeley College of Music.

593
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,300
I only had one class with the guy,

594
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
and my memories of him are vague.

595
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,300
But I just remember him being a pretty cool and funny guy.

596
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,300
And so I was ecstatic when I heard that he had gotten a deal

597
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,300
after school, so on and so forth.

598
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,300
And very sad when I heard later on that Kevin Gilbert died

599
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,300
from Autorotic asphyxiation, a sword of God.

600
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,300
So it's tragic.

601
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,300
And I got to tell you, Kevin was a really talented guy.

602
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,300
And at the time of his death, he was working on an album

603
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,300
called Shaming of the True.

604
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,300
And it was a rock opera about the music industry

605
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,300
was about a character named Johnny Virgil,

606
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,300
who basically comes from nowhere

607
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
to LA with these big rock and roll dreams.

608
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,300
And then he gets a record deal and becomes famous.

609
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,300
And then learns how emotionally bankrupt and shallow

610
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
the music industry really is.

611
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,300
So it's an amazing piece of work that was left unfinished

612
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,300
that the time was death and Kevin's friends

613
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,300
got together and they finished it.

614
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,300
So basically using the tracks that Kevin had left

615
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,300
and notes that he had left and just having worked with him

616
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,300
as much as they had to the best of their abilities.

617
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
They finished this.

618
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,300
But there were a few tracks that were pretty much completed

619
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,300
at the time of Kevin's death.

620
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,300
And one of them is like my favorite track on the record.

621
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,300
So I'm going to play that for you now.

622
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,300
So off of the album, the Shaming of the True.

623
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,300
This is the City of the Sun.

624
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:37,300
We sang a bar that hardly rang a bell.

625
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,300
I'm not born to make a lie.

626
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,300
The ball is in previnitions and fleeting thoughts

627
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:48,300
but I must admit that I tried to avoid it still.

628
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,300
So didn't want to see him see himself in me

629
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,300
with a look of an extinguish flame

630
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,300
that might be lurking there.

631
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,300
What she said with dripping drag

632
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,300
come on out total, get off my leg.

633
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:11,300
You've got to remember we're not in Kansas anymore.

634
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,300
Remember always a look for ways to please

635
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,300
and thank you for coming to twice

636
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,300
and before you go the sacred dinosaur.

637
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,300
Where are the birds?

638
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,300
Where are the birds?

639
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,300
Where are the birds?

640
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,300
Where are the birds?

641
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
Where are the birds?

642
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,300
Where are the birds?

643
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,300
Where are the birds?

644
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Where are the birds?

645
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
Where are the birds?

646
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
Where are the birds?

647
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,300
Where are the birds?

648
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,300
Where are the birds?

649
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Where are the birds?

650
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,300
Where are the birds?

651
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,300
Where are the birds?

652
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
Where are the birds?

653
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
Where are the birds?

654
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,300
Where are the birds?

655
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,300
Where are the birds?

656
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Where are the birds?

657
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
Where are the birds?

658
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Where are the birds?

659
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,300
Where are the birds?

660
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,300
Where are the birds?

661
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:22,300
Where are the birds?

662
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,300
Where are the birds?

663
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:31,300
In ports and things to say

664
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,300
We're here to help you make a new start

665
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:42,300
We're not gonna take your heart away

666
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,300
You stand before us like a veil figure

667
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,300
The end of a long gallery

668
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Distant and forever mysterious

669
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:59,300
It flies from the tasteless to the bland

670
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:05,300
Watch all that magic from your hands

671
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Make it so we might understand

672
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:18,300
Good morning, gracious

673
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:24,300
Good morning, special

674
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:29,300
And God knows for you

675
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:38,300
God knows for real, yes, yes, yes

676
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,300
Every one of you listening to this broadcast

677
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,300
I want you to pack your life

678
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,300
You're not going on a vacation

679
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,300
But we all move and I can't get your shall amen

680
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
Don't mind

681
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Because we're moving into the city of the sun

682
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,300
Where we can enjoy all of this play

683
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,300
We're happy to get your rest

684
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,300
Is this the shame you want to like it

685
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:14,300
To be I get to your heart of fire

686
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Do you understand more

687
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,300
Do you understand

688
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:38,300
Don't read the places where the big waves meet

689
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:46,300
We'll come to the city of the sun

690
00:33:46,300 --> 00:34:07,300
Oh, Johnny, you got to see it in your hand, it's the seed of your demise.

691
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Ambition's gonna lure you away into the land of compromise.

692
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,300
You stand before us like a brash of a ripened nectarine,

693
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,300
and someone better pick you soon.

694
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:35,300
Advice for the dying from the dead,

695
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:41,300
silence the voices in your hand,

696
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:47,300
wouldn't you rather eat instead?

697
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,300
Hi, you've reached the dilapidated shack of Johnny Virgil,

698
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
so I can't come to the phone at the moment,

699
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,300
please leave a name number after the F sharp.

700
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,300
City of the Sun by Kevin Gilbert,

701
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,300
and big big thanks to the estate of Kevin Gilbert

702
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
for giving me permission to play it.

703
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,300
I only wish you could get this album on iTunes.

704
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,300
I think the only place you can get it is you have to order the CD online

705
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,300
at a place called PopPlus1.com.

706
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,300
I'll put it in the show notes.

707
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,300
I should really place a more shit from this album

708
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,300
because it's just fucking mind blowing,

709
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,300
so as a concept record.

710
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,300
Tell you what, all week,

711
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,300
I'm going to play tunes that are from my private vault,

712
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,300
that you're not really going to hear most anywhere else.

713
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,300
Okay, that's my promise to you for sticking around.

714
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,300
Okay?

715
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,300
Hey, and a big shout out to my buddy Bob Parsons,

716
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
CEO of GoDaddy,

717
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,300
and to Nima Jones in the crew over at life online,

718
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
the radio show of the Bob Parsons says,

719
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,300
I can't say enough about GoDaddy.

720
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,300
I mean, fucking great company,

721
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,300
and I had a chance to go there and meet the people out there,

722
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,300
really nice people.

723
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,300
And I'm so used to people from LA

724
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,300
that when somebody actually says,

725
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,300
thank you to me and please,

726
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,300
and hello,

727
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,300
I'm actually surprised.

728
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,300
I'm overwhelmed by their kindness.

729
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,300
So,

730
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,300
you know, I'm a huge fan of GoDaddy,

731
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,300
because not only have they been a sponsor of Pacifico's Hellway

732
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,300
for like a year now,

733
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,300
but they have great service.

734
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,300
I use their service all the time.

735
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Whenever I need a domain name for something,

736
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,300
I go to GoDaddy,

737
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,300
and it's true.

738
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,300
It's true.

739
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,300
I got a bunch of domains registered with GoDaddy.

740
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,300
Like my favorite one,

741
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,300
of course, is FuckCorpardRadio.com,

742
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,300
which takes you right to CC Chapman's accident hash.

743
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
That's also fun to type in.

744
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,300
So, yeah, FuckCorpardRadio.com,

745
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,300
and I got that for 6.95 a year,

746
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,300
using Pro Locode PCH3 during checkout.

747
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,300
And yes, I'm going to print my fucking promo code,

748
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,300
because Adam already has enough money.

749
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,300
And,

750
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,300
So,

751
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,300
if you're looking for a domain name,

752
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,300
I mean, come on.

753
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,300
Who else are you going to go to?

754
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,300
GoDaddy is the number one domain

755
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,300
registered in the world,

756
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
and it's because of their service.

757
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,300
Who are you going to go just fucking,

758
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,300
I don't even know who else is out there.

759
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
I mean,

760
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,300
register flight.

761
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,300
Did you hear what happened to register fly?

762
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,300
Oh, my God.

763
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,300
I had my original domains.

764
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,300
When I first started like podcasting and shit,

765
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,300
we're with register fly.

766
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,300
Actually, that's not true.

767
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,300
Well, we're with net firms.

768
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,300
But I registered some other domain names at register fly.

769
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,300
And then I moved them, you know, like a year ago.

770
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
And then maybe a couple of months ago,

771
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,300
the story came out that the,

772
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,300
and correct me if I'm wrong.

773
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,300
That founders, the chairman,

774
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,300
the top guys at register fly,

775
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
were misappropriating funds,

776
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,300
and the money,

777
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,300
I swear to God,

778
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,300
this is true.

779
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,300
The money was being used for

780
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,300
liposuction,

781
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,300
and male escort.

782
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,300
Okay.

783
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,300
I swear to God.

784
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,300
So they had their registered,

785
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,300
nest thing pulled canceled.

786
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,300
So register fly got,

787
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,300
you know, basically put out a business.

788
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Because there were shitty company.

789
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,300
And if you ever tried to use their fucking control panel,

790
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,300
it was like,

791
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,300
you know, trying to shit out a ball of fish hooks.

792
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,300
It was just about that pleasant.

794
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,300

They're monks.

853
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,420
They don't hurt things.

854
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,420

855
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,420
