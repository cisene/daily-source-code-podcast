00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is the first time I've ever seen a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a film that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that you've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that you've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that I've ever seen in a movie that

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not something that you just do something on.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's not a big track, right?

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It has series of tools.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a joke.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Time to love jokes.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I just the other day got in an era that was set by my staff.

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The 10 or 5 in one in the fight. I got it yesterday.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Time to love jokes.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You're so amazing.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Because you got time to love with all these things.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Going on the era and commercially.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I think that's it.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Absolutely essential.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is an interpretation of my streaming.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You can go on the other side of that.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The chase.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The fiber optic, the network shows.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't have to have that kind of speed.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't think anyone here is to find one.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That control of the is.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's not a big track.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I think there's a series of tools.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And here we have this one situation.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The channel is streaming.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I can't.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's take it on.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I think it's absolutely essential.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And the center of whether you realize that you're asking for regulation.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But for massively invading this world of the internet.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's determined how.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes sir.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Not to decide.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But when we take the tip of the end.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
A fiber optic.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's really.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Medicaid that.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Anyone who wants to use it.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This system.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
For massive.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
More people think it's over.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Commercial purposes.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Those tools can be killed.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Time for that chose.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The internet is not something to do.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Why did we do that?

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why?

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And enormous tools.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's the series of tools.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Massive tools.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It really is.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The internet consumed in my life.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Because it got tangled up alone.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We say it going on there.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm actually.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The world has turned against this.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It didn't be wrong.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Personal.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And that.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The world has turned against this.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It didn't be wrong.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Personal.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The world has turned against this.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It didn't be wrong.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Personal.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm perfect for a Monday.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Perfect.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
To bring back a series of tools.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
DJ Ted's techno tubes.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Coming to you on the daily source code episode number 605.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hey, what's going on here.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm still at the curry man.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I should be in San Francisco.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
New York.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Or Austin.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No, no, no, no, no.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm here.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I should explain why.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
First of all, did you hear that opening?

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This is something I.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's called Let Them Sing It For You.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't know.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You've ever seen this.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I got an email from.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Robby Williams, which is R.W.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Robby Williams at Google email.com.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sure that's.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sure that's someone's really email address.

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And essentially you get a little player and you can just type in words.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It goes out and finds portions of songs or songs that let's see if a series of tubes work.

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If you put that in.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Hold on.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It really helps if you read along with at home.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's see if I can do comics, strip, blogger.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It doesn't of course have songs for everything.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let me see if this works.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
All right.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That just sucks.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
When I was a boy, my mom was drunk.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
She used to kick my ass.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It was probably knowing so much like wish.

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So maybe that's why I treat folks, especially women a little harsh.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You were the one that was drunk.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's why she kicked your ass.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How about you're the most pompous self-centered.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Full of him, Saul.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
As whole.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh my God.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Deep down inside, Johnny.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
There is something about you, we love.

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Really?

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So we dig your sorry, Saul.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What?

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's why we love playing bone.

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And of course we all love prizes.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Who doesn't?

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So find out who wins.

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And who gets the backhand, Johnny Todd.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm show four with us, the rumor girls.

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't touch him.

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Don't touch him.

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Johnny.

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What are you laughing for?

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Bone.

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't touch him.

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thing is off the hook.

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's just out of control with a number of people downloading listening to this game show

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
where you can win a fabulous Nokia N 800 tablet.

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Internet tablet.

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,140
Tablet internet tablet. Karen and Carla. Is it Karen and Carla? Yeah, Karen I think it is. Karen and Carla from Rumagirls

144
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,560
Yeah, that's right. They're on episode number four bone check it out bone dot podshow dot com. So

145
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Let me take it back to

146
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,100
Friday word came in a pay attention people to the east to the east of me now

147
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,880
Podshow is coming to Germany in fact. I'm coming to Germany tomorrow

148
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:57,720
I'll love the the whole idea is to fly the delta Sierra to my own aircraft to I think the meeting is in

149
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,300
Darmsh dot so if I were to fly commercial

150
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,280
Which is very well could happen depending on the weather tomorrow although today even would be pretty much flyable

151
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,340
We got ceilings of 3000 feet so no problems little bit of rain. That's just liquid sunshine

152
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,380
Normally I'd fly to Frankfurt now I can go direct to a small airfield

153
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,860
Not relatively small airfield within the same zone of right near Darmsh dot and

154
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,180
We got some meetings going on and I need some help. I need to now I've got a couple guys who are on the

155
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,060
On the network who already are in Germany

156
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,140
But if if you've got some some ideas about what could be done in different regions of Germany mind you

157
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,940
Is the big ass country compared to the little island we're sitting on here

158
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,020
Drop me an email at him at podshow.com

159
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,260
So that's that's why I didn't go to the I media conference because word came in that we're taking over

160
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,060
We're coming in we're coming into Germany and I have to admit to you

161
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:02,220
I know frightfully little about what's going on in Germany in general. I mean of course

162
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,020
I know lots of podcasters

163
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,020
Lots of shows I have some idea of the marketplace we've been in touch certainly when it comes to the pods

164
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,620
If music network we've had some great conversations some great back and forth discussion

165
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,420
But I mean is there is there a certain

166
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:23,060
Social network that that is big in Germany is the a B-bo here in the UK what's being used in Germany?

167
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,980
I don't know yeah, I mean everyone has a story and everyone will point to something

168
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,980
But it's kind of hard to figure out exactly

169
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,020
You know

170
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,380
Who's right or just getting enough information in general because if you look at iTunes

171
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,460
At the podcast chart for the German store

172
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,020
Yeah, it's like it doesn't really corroborate with the information

173
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,380
I'm getting about what the really popular shows are which of course would

174
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
All right kind of make sense

175
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,620
So please if you got any good intel you want to send my way I do it today

176
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:00,020
Those of you in the US and even on the on the European side of Laplandia time I'm not leaving before tomorrow afternoon

177
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,980
I'm gonna take it nice and easy and then when's they I'll fly back and I'll be back here

178
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,300
So and then from the I don't know what I'm gonna do I might be I might go to San Francisco next week

179
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:17,060
There's a lot of stuff happening in the in the UK crash pad office. It's just busy man and on top of all that today is day four

180
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,940
Of AC completely smoke free

181
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,620
Hate and people's like around me and so every like me person to stop smoking

182
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,620
Could appreciate it

183
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,620
It's probably not gonna be easy

184
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,460
I'll be worth it. Also your shows and the last two shows have been fine

185
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,020
You're on the ball too far out. I'll probably prefer do you think has been more with it?

186
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,740
I've been watching this wicked. I'll keep it up. Good luck. Bye

187
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,540
All right, Ben thanks. Well, you know what I'm gonna do

188
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,460
I'm gonna just say just to keep track. I think this counting thing does help me in many ways like we track episodes

189
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,940
So we're now 605 why don't we just say?

190
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,980
That ever since show 600 I've been smoke free not entirely right me on and instead of counting days let's just count

191
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,660
The number of episode starting at 600

192
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:27,380
It's kind of sad to hear that you think this show was it been sounding better. I don't know if I don't know that makes any difference whatsoever

193
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,060
But I've been getting through. I've been getting by and then I feel that the thing to do is just keep busy

194
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,060
If I sit down and just like do something like hang out and listen to something

195
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,460
becomes very difficult then that's the only time where I start thinking

196
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,860
Oh, man, yeah, like something then I usually jump up and do something else like what I do

197
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,540
Saturday

198
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,540
Oh, man, I flew to Bembridge

199
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,340
Bembridge is on the Isle of White a solo flight mind. You was still at a good win 2025 knots

200
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,380
It's about about 30 miles an hour

201
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:08,100
I must end that right and yeah, and it's really cool because you go down to the south of the south of of the country in fact

202
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,700
You're about to fall off so you you fly it over the over the ocean and then just a little off to the right

203
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,820
Is the Isle of White and there's two airfields and this the Bembridge you literally come in

204
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,100
I think the the cliff is probably about a hundred feet far maybe it's 70

205
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,820
Well, let's just say a hundred feet high from the water and you're literally coming in over this cliff

206
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,100
Before it's almost like landing on an aircraft carrier to be honest with the wind blasting from the side

207
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,460
Of course because only one one runway and this thing it has like it's like a dip it has an elevation

208
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,780
It kind of ramps up from both sides so when you land you want to kind of you know pay attention to

209
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,940
Landing somewhere a little bit before the middle of the runway because then once you've landed the runway, you know ramps up

210
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,940
So that could get kind of tricky

211
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,140
Just getting your wheels on the ground, but it was great, man. I felt really energized

212
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,980
Had a cup of coffee there. There was no one flying because it was too windy and then I I hoofed it back

213
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,980
Here's a cool thing I gave

214
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,540
So I bought a VHF radio

215
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,700
So you can you could use that as a backup in place of an electrical emergency

216
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:20,340
I got to get one for Patricia for full time, but I gave it to her and she and just put it downstairs on the squelch

217
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,460
And I put it on frequency one two three decimal four

218
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:29,220
Five zero which is pretty much the standard frequency when pilots want to talk to each other in the air

219
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,060
You know, it's like I want to three for five and everyone knows you can switch over there. It's not by any means private

220
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,740
But I was flying over the over the manner and

221
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:43,460
And I tried it out and I put it on the second second comb box and I called that asshole one to asshole two

222
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,460
And within like four seconds production of flight asshole two to asshole one

223
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,220
It was just it was fun, man. It was totally useless, but it was fun to just you know

224
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,220
She was waving and and

225
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,660
She could hear me. I mean she could communicate with me all the way back to home base

226
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,580
Of course, I was paying attention to air traffic control on like the other frequency at the same time. It was kind of busy

227
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,220
So we didn't have a long conversation, but it works. I got to get her own radio

228
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,500
So whenever I'm coming home, I can just say that I'm on my way and

229
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,460
Get dinner ready to here

230
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,540
I'm more about my non-smoking and that would let up to it

231
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:27,780
Hey, Adam. This is Dean. I'm down here in Houston, Texas and I was the daily source code every day and I love it

232
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,900
And I was listening to

233
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,860
The first they show I forget what number it is, but

234
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:41,060
Hey, please don't let some guy look in at your palm decide your future that's all bullshit

235
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,220
Yes, you can quit smoking. Yes. You should exercise. Yes. You should eat a healthy diet, but

236
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,860
Don't base your life off some guy looking at your palm and doing what's called a cold reading

237
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,020
on you and let it influence you in what you think you're doing

238
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,660
Who's talking to you from the great beyond

239
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:10,900
What's all bullshit just eat healthy quit smoking kicks and exercise and keep kicking up the daily source code

240
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,420
I love it. Thank you very much. Goodbye. All right, man. You know

241
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,620
Basically it's cold reading or not. He got me to do the exit those exact same things

242
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,820
I've already been eaten healthy but today. Yes. I pulled out the rowing machine

243
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:32,420
I know that some of the excess boxes have been moved out of the house still from the move and I sat down when I rode

244
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,980
I rode that sucker as hard as I could

245
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,060
email from Maurice

246
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,380
Remember he did the

247
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,380
Podsafe sack

248
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,020
Back with episode number two. Let's see how hard it is today

249
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,900
Hey, and I'm so here's part two that Podsafe sack

250
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,220
Okay, so he thought it was a little bit too easy last time make it hard and fix that of course

251
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:04,260
And I'm glad jumplet get on this. This hit that's great to have him back on the scene as well. All right

252
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:10,180
Although I must admit that my production work doesn't really has the flashes like

253
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,100
But anyway, yeah, I'll try to make the best of it. So why is it that all the Podsafe production

254
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:24,580
Coming from the Netherlands. I love the one that young politically recently and I think he'll be coming up with more and and I think we're just gonna

255
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,700
Forge ahead with this stuff and say hey, it's all under the

256
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:34,260
Under the banner of education because we need to know about these songs our children need to learn for the future

257
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,260
Oh

258
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,900
Planet of women do waking up the neighborhood

259
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,860
Anyway, I think you took number two

260
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:55,220
That's uh, thank god. Jones. So they still think it's too easy. We'll get an harder. Let's go to clip number three

261
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,060
All right, let's go to the answer then this was clip number one

262
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Planet of yeah

263
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,500
This I need to reward myself

264
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,100
Wow

265
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,740
So onto the next clip this was the number two

00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,380
Got that new york

00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,780
Thank you Jones with first date. Oh, yeah, and I still can remember

268
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,180
Physically today. I first heard his song

269
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,340
I thought it was the

270
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,340
See you're something like that. I'm not sure

271
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,340
I'm a breacher. Yeah, I'm breacher

272
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,820
There was a last problem in the memories. Let's go on to the third answer. Okay, third team

273
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
Oh

274
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,500
Yeah, see the sun that we'll know black lab from the their Russia-jard days

275
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,300
Oh, those days

276
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,660
Oh, so it was so long ago the three answers and you didn't find it too easy

277
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,820
I'd like to like the second episode of the pot safe second you can go over to www.potsafesec.com

280
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
My name is Maurice and I'm signing off

281
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,580
So you know, I'm thinking about doing all these

282
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:34,180
mashups and the hit tests and and what the fuck am I worried about? I look at the Hillary Clinton dot com

283
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,340
And right there on the page. This is amazing

284
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,220
Choose our campaign song

285
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,980
Listen to the following nine songs and choose your favorite or if you have your own suggestion

286
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,780
Write in a song an artist in the space provided

287
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
I cannot imagine

288
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:59,860
That the rights have been cleared to put these songs up to be played in their entirety now

289
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,340
You may not be able to download them. In fact, let me just see if I can view so I was a flash player doesn't mean we can't

290
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,940
Can't get it done hold on. I mean they got you two in here

291
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
We've got a

292
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
City of blinding lights suddenly I see

293
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,780
I'm a believer get ready temptations ready to run the Dixie chicks rock this country

294
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,740
Should I attend beautiful day that you're here now in its entirety?

295
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,140
And right here right now Jesus Jones and I'll take you there the staple singers

296
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,340
Which I think every single one of them sucks as a campaign song

297
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,100
You should go check that out Hillary Clinton dot com. We'll put a link in the show notes

298
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,860
So you know and you know exactly what's going on here. What's happening is all the the record company

299
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,580
I presume record companies maybe you twos down put

300
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:51,140
Yeah, the record company owns all these rights and they're just like oh, yeah, please play it over and over make it the campaign song totally totally bogus

301
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,020
Maybe this should just go sue Hillary Clinton. I think it would I think that would be just if not

302
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Long live the hit test and the mashups

303
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:09,220
on May 29 unwind with Angie B will present an artist spotlight on love spirals and love spirals

304
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,020

Time that was where I was in the 90s with with the low spoused downs and and those spouses were I am

308
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,740
Revolutionary periods in music history and I just amazed like wow you could get all the songs on your computer

309
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,540
And you can like move the tracks around is blew my mind how many knew what I wanted to do

I wanted to like produce in the studio. I just have didn't have access to that technology now

314
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,900
And finally Robin got his uh his stable of divas together to come up with something for me

315
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,020
Hey Adam it's Julie from the diva cast and I'm here hi Adam

316
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,420
World timing in but I hear you talking about Tylenol PM and I wanted to tell you about my story

317
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,220
I've always used Tylenol PM and I love it

318
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,820
And I did there's a few reasons but my latest story I wanted to tell you about is I was in the yard the other day

319
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:37,780
Worked in the yard finally it's getting pretty down here and got some weeding done and I went to bed and my back was killing me

320
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:45,300
Took a hot shower that didn't help got in bed and took a couple of Tylenol PM and got the best night's sleep

321
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:52,900
Now here's a catch being a mom. I have three children and my son my youngest had a bad dream and I

322
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:59,700
woke up in the middle of the night and got him settled down and putting back to bed and I know with sleep aids

323
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,780
That's a big fear being a mom that if you take something you're not going to be able to wake up for your children

324
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,780
Right, and that's why I like Tylenol PM

325
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:13,700
Because I was able to wake up. I was very alert. I wasn't out of it at all and then the next morning when I woke up

326
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,100
I wasn't fuzzy or some of that like you might get with cold medicine or some of your sleep aids

327
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,860
Right, you were still functional. I was functional and I was clear so

328
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,180
I'm a believer and I think more moms out there need to know about it because the divots know about it

329
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:34,020
And it's definitely a divadue a divadue definitely. That's a divadue. Hey, you know that's interesting

330
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:40,500
I hadn't thought about that but I it makes of course total sense that that moms would love to have something to help them get to sleep or leave any

331
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,180
Any aches pains, but they still want to be able to wake up should there be a reason for it

332
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,180
Oh, that's why it's a divadue. You know

333
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,780
Robin who who produces the diva cast

334
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:58,500
He left the recording running and he came up with some more interesting divadue. She might want to listen into

335
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,460
So this is a voyeuristic list. Yeah, I'm serious. Check out what just sucks

336
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,300
Yeah, that would be that go well. That would be underwear that is regular with that's not thongs

337
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,180
You're gonna get so much trouble Robin. Don't work for Amy

338
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
Really

339
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,240
If you're crack anyway, no matter what my dog and

340
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,140
But, but is made wrong then it is

341
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:35,300
Maybe you need to go for an underwear fitting because you go white. It's not supposed to go be by no in my Dap

342
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,660
In mind don't either okay, I'm always having all my life

343
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,740
problem

344
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,780
No

345
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,780
Alright, this enough of them.

346
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,780
And more women clutch.

347
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,780
You know, I listen to the showgirls, and they really went overboard now.

348
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,780
And the most recent episode, talking about Adam moments.

349
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,780
I was pretty frightening.

350
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,780
I finally, Angie B has mastered up the time or courage,

351
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,780
or maybe a combination there of to send me an audio comment.

352
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,780
Hey, Adam, it's Angie.

353
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,780
So, we girls got to talking about you on showgirls this week.

354
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,780
I just thought I should mess up now, you know, you'll hear it eventually.

355
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:28,780
But I don't know, I somehow started getting really mushy and reflecting on just how wonderful you've been for me and my career and how great pod show has been.

356
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,780
It's been awesome working with you guys on and wind.

357
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,780
I've received so much support.

358
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:39,780
And the listeners are really into the show, and it's just been a really good experience for me.

359
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,780
I just wanted to thank you.

360
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,780
Sorry, I missed your 600th.

361
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,780
I really meant to send you some audio feedback.

362
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,780
But anyways, we all kind of shared our Adam moments.

363
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,780
Only four of the showgirls were in this week,

364
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,780
but we had special guests Natalie Del Conti,

365
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,780
and she shared her Adam moment as well.

366
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,780
Oh, I didn't hear that.

367
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,780
It's like warning.

368
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,780
We went off on kind of a crazy tangent of naughty words

369
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,780
that were found on the urban dictionary.

370
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,780
So, I don't know.

371
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,780
I think you'll get a kick out of that.

372
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,780
Anyways, great to talk to you as always Adam.

373
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,780
Thank you.

374
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,780
I'll check them out, showgirls.potshow.com.

375
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,780
Art from Mashup Towns been sending it in again.

376
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,780
He's back on the beat for short.

377
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,780
DJ Peking, warning, rush where it's at.

378
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,780
It's a whole bunch of turns.

379
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,780
It's a matter of distance.

380
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,780
It's a matter of distance.

381
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,780
The president came back.

382
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,780
It's like you told us.

383
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,780
Man, man, you're open and ready to open.

384
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,780
It's like you're ready to get away.

385
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,780

Did you remember that I feel like you're telling

00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,580
God, I should believe that you better not cross

443
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,980
It's the God, poor, poor, poor

444

That you'll encourage us, you'll take

446
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,780
God, I shouldn't refame for sure

447
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,580
God, I'm the mere victim of the poor

448
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,440
That you'll encourage us, you'll思

449

485
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,620
Okay, it's time for our Savon from our series of the Circle of Savon.

486
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,620
I'm the Sultan of Savon.

487
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,620
Savon.

488
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,620
I think I'm going to be able to get at least one Savon in episode.

489
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,620
There's a fast forward button on that forward for a reason.

490
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,620
And I hope to be able to talk to Savon every single day, Savon.

491
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:20,620
And by the way, I want you to know that this format change doesn't mean that I don't

492
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,620
want to make a picture by the southern of Savon Savon Savon Savon Savon.

493
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:32,620
Mashup by DJ Peaking from down under you heard Green Day's warning versus Bex

494
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,620
Where's it at versus Big Audio Dynamite's Rush?

495
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Man, I love that stuff.

496
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,620
Link, of course, at DailySourceco.com.

497
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,620
Let's get from the boat ridginspotcast.com, which I hosted the pod show.

498
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:10,620
And I keep having a problem over and over and over again.

499
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,620
When I try to log in to my page to upload another show or work on my profile or whatever,

500
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:22,620
I enter my ID and my password and it sends me back to another login page.

501
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,620
Try to get in, it sends me back to another login page.

502
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,620
I send air message to your tech support.

503
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,620
They seem to fix it and it will us another month or so and then it happens again.

504
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:41,620
Did you find out from your guys down there, what the problem and fix it?

505
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,620
Once and for all, that's it.

506
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:57,620
I do.

507
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,620
I do.

508
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,620
It may be the decaf.

509
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,620
Folders would be better for you.

510
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,620
I'm not quite sure what's going on with that, but shit does happen.

511
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,620
And part of what we're doing now is trying to understand exactly what you do and how you use

512
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,620
pod show programming and the network and the pod save music network.

513
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,620
And then give us some answers to some simple questions help us suck less.

514
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,620
I understand if the login doesn't work, we got to fix that.

515
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,620
I'll take care of that personally, I promise.

516
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,620
Probably just one server in the cluster going, hey, why are you know?

517
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
I've got all that techy experience.

518
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,620
I'll fix it for you.

519
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:45,620
Help us suck less help us suck less.

520
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,620
Go to suckless.potjo.com

521
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,620
I want to tell you something, okay?

522
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,620
And I want to leave a message for you right now.

523
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,620
Because again, it's getting 30 here and you're going to win day.

524
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:04,620
And once again, I'm in an ass of myself trying to get to a phone to call you a specific time.

525
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,620
Where are you?

526
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,620
I called you 20 minutes ago and you never called me back.

527
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,620
When the time comes for me to make the phone call, I stop.

528
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,620
Where are I'm doing?

529
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,620
And I go when I make that phone.

530
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,620
You told me I did it that you were going to pick me up at 11.

531
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,620
It's like, I would have made other plans.

532
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,620
I wouldn't have that phone turn down.

533
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,620
It was the third time recently that you promised to do something to me dad.

534
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,620
I'm completely freaked out on me.

535
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,620
I didn't know something, okay?

536
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,620
I'm tired of playing this game with you.

537
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,620
I understand you have to work in your busy, but I'm your daughter.

538
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,620
When you promise me something, something is simple.

539
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,620
I'm going to pick me up when you say you're going to pick me up.

540
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,620
And you do it.

541
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,620
I am being in a plane.

542
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,620
And I'm going to come out there for the day.

543
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,620
And I'm going to straighten your ass out.

544
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,620
When I see you, you want to stand up.

545
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,620
I'm so not fucking standing here in the middle of the night on the sidewalk.

546
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,620
Like some crazy homeless person.

547
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,620
I have the point where the decent man has a human being.

548
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,620
I don't give a damn that you're 12 years old or 11 years old.

549
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,620
But you're trying your father.

550
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,620
There's a father standing in the ass.

551
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,620
Who doesn't care about what you do.

552
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,620
I'm right.

553
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,620
I'm getting sick of these children.

554
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,620
They're all in trouble.

555
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,620
And I'm like, they're probably one of these people.

556
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,620
You are really comfortable.

557
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,620
Just have to support to do what you have.

558
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,620
And I'm very ironed.

559
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,620
You're telling me you've got a real little stone of fire on me.

560
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,620
Oh, my God.

561
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,620
I'm not fucking fucking hot.

562
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,620
Oh, my God.

563
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,620
I'm not hot.

564
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,620
I'm not hot.

565
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,620
I'm not hot.

566
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,620
I'm not hot.

567
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,620
I'm not hot.

568
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,620
You better be standing out the day.

569
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,620
There's enough money to pay for this guy.

570
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,620
I know.

571
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,620
Really make sure you get it.

572
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,620
I'm a choreographer.

573
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,620
Come on.

574
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,620
You fucking better be wearing men's clothing.

575
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:49,620
Oh, that's Matt from the Daven match show at DavenMatch Show.com.

576
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,620
It'll make stuff like Baldwin with Christina's rant.

577
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,620
I went pretty well together, I think.

578
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,620
I don't know.

579
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,620
I think they have a career possibly.

580
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,620
All right.

581
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,620
This song I'll mess up my kid in yours for sure.

582
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,620
Of course, it's from the podcast and music network.

583
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,620
So do enjoy safely.

584
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,620
I was sitting at home the other day.

585
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,620
Here in hand, pizza on the way.

586
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,620
The turner, classic room.

587
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,620
It's not turner, huge.

588
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,620
First of all, even Michael came.

589
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,620
We're driving Diane, Canada and St.

590
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,620
But after the killer, I saw the two of him smooch.

591
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,620
I haven't felt so weird since I was young.

592
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,620
I'm not sure, but I think there might have been children.

593
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,620
I didn't understand.

594
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,620
They both were men.

595
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,620
Men of voice in my head said, yeah, so what?

596
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,620
And I know his Chris had a real nice button.

597
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,620
I knew I was never going to be the same again.

598
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,620
Well, I walked straight in narrow.

599
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,620
But now it's a little bent.

600
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,620
I used to be full head or roll.

601
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,620
I wonder where that went.

602
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,620
After quit being a scout master.

603
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,620
And I have to leave my wife.

604
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,620
Two guys kissing ruin my life.

605
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,620
I should my head not change the channel.

606
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,620
Saw some guy in a cap of flannel singing.

607
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,620
He was a lumberjack and he was okay.

608
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,620
But he was so good.

609
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,620
I kept on surfing.

610
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,620
Got broke back.

611
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,620
Mountain Rocky Horn.

612
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,620
The bird cage and I stopped counting when I got to gravel.

613
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,620
And the whole damn network was gay.

614
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,620
I sat in that square with the funniest feeling.

615
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,620
I figured I'd need some sexual healing.

616
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,620
But that was my Marvin Gaye on my aching head.

617
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,620
I'd have sworn I was straight to I saw that kissing.

618
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,620
But it showed me something.

619
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,620
But I had been missing.

620
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,620
I'd ruled out half of humanity.

621
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,620
Sharing my bed.

622
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,620
The techniques all look normal.

623
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,620
But the details are kind of weird.

624
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,620
Doesn't much cash act like Velcro.

625
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,620
When it runs into a beard.

626
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,620
Agonized and re-affraised.

627
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,620
As caused me endless strife.

628
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,620
Two guys kissing ruin my life.

629
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,620
The internet and magazines and every film and book.

630
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,620
This slashy stuff is all I'm seeing.

631
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,620
Everywhere I look.

632
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,620
Went football players watching each other.

633
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,620
It seems more intense.

634
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,620
And all that hairy, drag-o-stuff is starting to make sense.

635
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,620
Each time I thought about it.

636
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,620
I wondered should I try.

637
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,620
To have a close encounter with another horny guy.

638
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,620
Because it would still be cheating on my wife.

639
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,620
I'm pretty sure.

640
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,620
I could tell her in any other woman.

641
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,620
But it sure is heck ain't her.

642
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,620
Then my mouth would have checked.

643
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,620
I couldn't afford.

644
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,620
We were watching the People's Choice Awards.

645
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,620
With Hugh Jackman and Hugh Login.

646
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,620
Touchy feeling.

647
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,620
I said, yeah.

648
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,620
I bet they're the People's Choice.

649
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,620
Even I'm like kissing to one of my boys.

650
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,620
And my wife said, and a self-revoiced.

651
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,620
Really?

652
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,620
Since then, our love life is freaking unreal.

653
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,620
We weren't sure.

654
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,620
And say what we feel.

655
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,620
She tells me your fantasies.

656
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,620
And I tell her, mine.

657
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,620
It's more romance than we've ever had.

658
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,620
But there is one thing that makes me mad.

659
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,620
I got addicted to queer eye and top design.

660
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,620
My next car, but you shut me.

661
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,620
And my hair is set goodbye.

662
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,620
But the girls down at the office.

663
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,620
They got me they're kind of guy.

664
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
I lost all my machismo.

665
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,620
With acceptance I am right.

666
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,620
Two guys kissing ruined my life.

667
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,620
Two guys kissing ruined my life.

668
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,620
Little bit, little bit of constant.

669
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,620
Tom Smith from the Phump project.

670
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,620
Which we haven't had.

671
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,620
We haven't had great success with playing.

672
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,620
Several of their tracks.

673
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,620
They're all on the podcast music network.

674
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,620
And of course, a link to Tom Smith's.

675
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,620
Anthem.

676
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,620
Two guys kissing ruined my life.

677
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,620
All right.

678
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,620
We're just under 40 minutes.

679
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,620
Perfect timing.

680
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,620
I have no idea when the next show will be.

681
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,620
If I do fly to Germany tomorrow,

682
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,620
I will be recording the entire track.

683
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,620
Track, track, track, track route.

684
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,620
Flight planned, et cetera.

685
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,620
And that will be part of Tuesday's show.

686
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,620
So stay tuned.

687
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,620
DailySourceco.com.

688
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,620
Adam and podshow.com day four.

689
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
Smoke free.

690
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,620
Thank you.

691
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,620
Another podshow podcast.

692
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,620
Stick it in your ear.
