I have on the hook as I was right there.

263
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,760
I had a little bit of the boost.

264
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,760
I got it.

265
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
I got it.

266
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
I got it.

267
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,920
Gosh, you know, it's what's happening. All right, so maybe it's a little softer in one year now for some reason

268
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,640
It's been one of those weekends. It's been one of those days. It's been it's been just crazy

269
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,960
Man, this is really gonna this is gonna bother to shit out of me if if you guys can't hear properly

270
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,080
Hold on, let me see let me just try something here hold on bear with me

271
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,920
Okay, that was an interesting experiment now. Let's try the other channel

272
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Yeah, okay

273
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:09,720
Well, hopefully you hear me in both ears anyway, so let me let me just prep us a couple things. So yeah in New York

274
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,280
How should I maybe I should take it back to Friday? Just to make it easy on myself to do it in chronological order

275
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,960
And then I'll and I'll get to all the other stuff that's happening right now. So

276
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,440
Fluida New York on Friday last Friday food bar you remember I did the food bar show and everything was all messed up and the life was food bar in general

277
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,920
And okay, the flight was on eventful got in state at the we have a corporate apartment here

278
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,440
Which the sales team in New York actually kind of managed the apartment

279
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:47,000
So it's their office and when the guys come in from out of town they stay there and and

280
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,240
Some of our production people also use uses it's like a crash pad. It's very much like the shortage office in in London

281
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:01,000
Only we didn't get the same interior decoration done imagine a two bedroom New York apartment

282
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,720
Fabulous view of the Empire state building

283
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,240
You can you can see right up to Broadway from from I mean the view is just spectacular

284
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,280
It's a great building it gets a nine on a scale of one to ten for location

285
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,120
But when you get guys who do the interior decorating you get pretty much what you'd expect

286
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
It's like a dormant with guys who had money

287
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,320
They've got these I stayed in one of the bedrooms and they've got this

288
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:35,400
One of these posture tetra pedic thing mattresses that's supposed to form itself to your body

289
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,120
Well that's basically for me. It was like sleeping in a slab of clay

290
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
That was not

291
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,400
Not my cup of tea to say the least

292
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,360
And the living room has no couch. It has we have lots of desks and and plenty of wifi access

293
00:07:52,760 --> 00:08:00,120
And then and I don't know how big this TV. There's a TV in there that it's like it must be like a 70 inch television

294
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,320
You know like rear view projection whatever

295
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
It's crazy

296
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:13,400
I was one there for one night and then the next day left for Wilmington North Carolina home of port city pd of course

297
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
one of the

298
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,760
One of my favorite shows on the the pod show network you can find the port city pd

299
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:28,040
podshow.com. It's a cop show. It's real simple and the production value of this thing in the story and the editing is is top notch

300
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:35,400
And you know we're a winding down series one and I can't remember exactly how they came about

301
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,720
But we agreed somehow even in the contract

302
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,800
This is something you know I told you before that podshow contracts are all the more unique

303
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,120
And in this particular one part of the contract was that I would appear in an episode of port city pd

304
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Now we tried to do it for episode six

305
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,200
But it didn't work out schedule wise and so then we did it with that episode seven and I had a you know

306
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,200
I play an FBI agent agent Quinn no less and

307
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,160
So you know I go to North Carolina and I kind of forgot in the North Carolina is not it's only like an hour and 15 minutes away from from New York

308
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,160
You just hop on the shuttle. You know, it's it's really convenient and the weather is beautiful

309
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,480
You arrive there and like oh man of course

310
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,480
They've got beaches. They've got you know colleges universities is beautiful people walking around

311
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
It's historic at the same time and

312
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,880
You have to know

313
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
that North Carolina is is

314
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,360
Has recently I don't know not only recently, but I think maybe they did they read it their tax code again

315
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,560
and it is without a doubt one of the most

316
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
financially

317
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,560
Attractive states in the union for television and film production

318
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,600
And right next the airport that's a huge MGM sound state it says about

319
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,960
$300 million worth of productions taking place already in in Wilmington

320
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Dawson's Creek was shot there one tree hill

321
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
This you know several

322
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,320
Major motion pictures that are being being done there and

323
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,120
What happens when you have that type you know on the way in the talk to the the guy at the shuttle bus driver for the

324
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,400
Yeah for the Hilton

325
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:25,000
So yeah, so I tell me about Wilmington. Yeah, he says well, you know basically we're tourism here and we've got great beaches and and of course

326
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,840
You know the entertainment industry that's really big for us

327
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,760
And so when you have a community that you know that gets all this money ported and also it gets ported into the local community

328
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:43,560
Of course when to film and television productions come the town you get something that in LA has existed for many many years

329
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,640
But it's so fresh and and new in Wilmington. It's really it really turned me on you get a whole subculture of

330
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,680
People who like video and now that the tools have changed and and this generation in Wilmington has grown up

331
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
really with

332
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
necessity being the mother of invention

333
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,880
What they've done is instead of just you know only trying to scam jobs on on these big productions

334
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,240
They've started doing their own productions and that's where this whole port city PD thing came from these people who are professionals

335
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,240
Really know what they're doing and

336
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,240
You know sometimes they work on big big budget productions and lots of other times they don't and so

337
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
they all kind of get together actors

338
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
directors of photography

339
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:35,880
Directors producers and they all have you know day jobs and and either they're waiting on tables or or you know

340
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,040
Some of them auditioned in New York, but they all there's a really beautiful culture of hey

341
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Let's just make some cool ass shit

342
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,920
And I was blown away by first all the way

343
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,400
You know the professionalism of all the people who work on port city PD

344
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,960
It's a you know big crew when you think about and if you ever seen the show you'll know exactly what I'm talking about

345
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,440
And everyone has a

346
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,680
Everyone has a demo DVD of some short or movies full-length movie

347
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,720
like unbelievable motion pictures

348
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
shot all on HD

349
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:23,240
HD cameras you know an edited and final cut pro or premiere and I'm so excited and I really really and it hasn't

350
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,880
I mean it's been a long time since I pulled almost a virtual all nighter

351
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,120
But we were really

352
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,000
You know we we met with the producers we were not to dinner and then we went hung out and then of course

353
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,720
You know lots of people from the cast and crew were dropping by and everyone had a cool interesting story and everyone's working on something before you know

354
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,600
It's like two o'clock which of course sat at a night was not two o'clock. It was three o'clock and then before you know it

355
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,680
It's four and you're in bed by five and I had a a call my call time was 8 a.m

356
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,880
For my scene and port city PD and you know and everyone was there man even though we were all and you we all only slept a couple hours

357
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,440
and

358
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,920
And it was very very invigorating to be in such a creative community

359
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,640
With so many people who have so many interesting ideas and things going on and just really messed up stuff that they've made

360
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,240
Which I'm so happy to see and and we're gonna try and get as much as possible on the on the network

361
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,720
You know the little that's just lots and lots and lots of business to be done very excited about that. It was a great trip

362
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
So was it Sunday came back to New York

363
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,760
Crash real hard Sunday night, you know, I I luckily had already done my serious satellite stuff and

364
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,480
You know, I just had to sleep. I just couldn't do a show because we had a full day today and right now

365
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
New York time is also

366
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
We'll just call it Tuesday if you're in London

367
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,560
It's almost midnight so

368
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,760
Basically Tuesday if you don't mind me calling it that and

369
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,800
You know, I got everything set up. It seems to be working reasonably well

370
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,400
This is the the mobile kit that I put together. I was able to get the right

371
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
adapters and plugs and cables

372
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,360
by the way, it's a personas is this

373
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,680
Compressor limiter than I'm using it's a real sweet

374
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:20,520
You can hear some of the New York street sounds out there. It's a real sweet box. Um, I love this box. I love sweet boxes

375
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,760
Speaking of sweet boxes

376
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,760
If I'm not gonna get the lady Patricia on the show

377
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,600
I'm gonna get her on the show. I really am maybe you could descend in a voicemail comment

378
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Because maybe if they hear from you, she'll believe it

379
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,080
Tell her she had needs to come on the show

380
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,080
There's a whole part of my life the ones that we share together that she knows

381
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,240
About you know you should send her email you really should you really should

382
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Patricia Curry dot com

383
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,120
Lady Patricia's outside of course

384
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,600
She said why why should she send this to the old new show?

385
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,360
Why? Why why?

386
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,520
She has other things to do. That's so sad. I can't coordinate with her

387
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Maybe you could descend in a voicemail comment

388
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,080
You know you should send her email Patricia Curry dot com that's a sonder from

389
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,080
Podcasts studio.nl

390
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,440
Trying to motivate the lady Patricia to come on the show of course

391
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,680
That's kind of tough me being New York and she's an engineering a good time, man

392
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,680
They're having the girls are having some fun back in in old blighty

393
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,920
I'm kind of jealous of that

394
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,880
But I did say I forwarded her the link

395
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,840
So I and I know when I forward it to or she's kind of click on it and she'll hear it and she'll probably get it and

396
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Hopefully by the time I get back we'll have

397
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Yeah, you know

398
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
We'll have a show we will make show together

399
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040

And so meeting with Joanne the editor and chief and meeting with the publisher and yeah

411
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,960
I know that if Patricia knew that you know she'd be here and yeah

412
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,880
I think she's secretly quite jealous that she's not here because this time around

413
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,800
We are meeting with lots of lots of cool people and it's just been back to back

414
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Advertising agencies

415
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:49,880
Some of the clients directly and I got to tell you the buzz is big and really is and and what you're seeing is that

416
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Everyone is starting to understand

417
00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:00,600
This stuff about advertising that you know that we've been talking about that they're you know the first of all that there's an audience that is

418
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,560
You know it fits somewhere between

419
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,400
mainstream

420
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,080
television and radio and and like my space

421
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,280
virality and and you know it seems to be you guys

422
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Congratulations

423
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,000
Advertises want to talk to you

424
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,000
So we'll hold auditions for them shall we

425
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,400
And then who's got the New York hook up?

426
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,440
That's the one thing I've never quite completed in the past two years. I need a new York connection

427
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
No, what I mean

428
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Thank you

429
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,640
Hi, this is Peter Tlothero from the Suffolk and Cool podcast with a very brief and special invitation to you

430
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,640
To get involved with an experiment in networking

431
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,760
What is there's a couple of guys in Australia who have come across somebody else's blog

432
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,200
And they want to make contact with that person

433
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:04,040
But they don't want to go direct to them what they want to do is to try and use the blogger's fear podcasters personal contacts

434
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,040
Anybody who knows anybody else to find really secure it is rude to this person

435
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,680
So if I tell you that the message is coming from a couple of guys called

436
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,000
Dave Wallace and Mike safefang in Australia

437
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,120
And they're trying to contact

438
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,480
indirectly

439
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,240
GP Rangaswami who in fact is the CIO for British telecom's global service

440
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,080
And he has a blog at a confused of Carl Cutter

441
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,080
And so what they're trying to do is to find

442
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,760
a bunch of people to connect through personal contacts to eventually find their way to

443
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,520
GP Rangaswami

444
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
So it's arrived with me

445
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,360
I'm actually based in the east of England in the UK

446
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,600
And I'm passing out to you and I'm inviting you in fact to pass on this MP3 if you would to anybody

447
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,080
You think might even be a connection

448
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,720
Or even if you don't think there is it's it's incredible how the connections do crop up

449
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,440
So if you could that would be really good and you'll find information about exactly where to contact

450
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,600
And who to contact let us know how the the space telephone is working

451
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,960
In the Suffolk and Cool show notes for the podcast number 55

452
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,760
And you'll find that basically get the Suffolk and Cool website which is all the dumps

453
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
Suffolk and cool

454
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,320
dot com

455
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
things very much indeed for your help

456
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
It's fun this I tell you

457
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,760
All right, I mean I could pick up the phone and just call the guy

458
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,320
Really I could

459
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,720
But I guess that's not the point space telephone. Okay. I'm in. I'm in. There you go

460
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,200
We see a couple of things. I just want to talk about the came in over email. Yeah, this was a quite a shocker

461
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,480
James

462
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,480
He sends me a link to

463
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,640
BBC new story. Yeah quite disconcerning

464
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,480
Hold on here it comes. Soul band the drifters have been involved in a serious car crash on the M1 in South Yorkshire

465
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,280
Which is nasty, but I hadn't heard about this. What did this come out this came out to

466
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,360
uh

467
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:23,000
Yesterday the accident happened near ratherum ratherum ratherum ratherum ratherum ratherum

468
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,480
ratherum

469
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,800
Happening the early hours of Monday when the bands car hit another vehicle that had crashed after swirving to avoid a deer

470
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,080
Patrick Allen joined the band the 1990 suffered head injuries and was being treated at ratherum hospital

471
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,680
and the other three band members Peter Lamar Victor

472
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,360
Beno I think it is by no Beno and Rowan turning escape with less serious injuries

473
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,920
Wow

474
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,400
Oh man that really sucks guys I hope everything everything works out particularly

475
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,360
With with Patrick James thanks for sending that one in

476
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,280
I really should have had some drifters ready to play for you in hindsight

477
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,440
And of course boy did I get a lot of email about the conversation

478
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:19,160
That I started about the channel for fill which of course now you've probably seen on curry.com or maybe you've sorted out yourself

479
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,920
He's available both on google video and and youtube

480
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Of course I'm referring to the great global warming swindle and

481
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,720
I got a lot of comments and I haven't even gone through the all throughout the voice mails yet

482
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,840
I just wanted to read part of this one. This is from Thomas crossland of course to call my eye because he starts off by saying as a

483
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,120
former aerospace engineer now an environmental scientist

484
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,240
I always cringe when you start talking about science topics

485
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,360
That makes me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside while I generally enjoy your show

486
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,800
You are very susceptible to media washing of various topics

487
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,680
First of all let me just say

488
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
You should go back and listen because

489
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,600
I didn't say that I believed in and I said it was very compelling and now I said the same thing about an ink and being in truth

490
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,000
You know, I'm just the messenger in this case. I don't know what the hell I'm talking about

491
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,200
But yeah, of course I'm susceptible and I'm a smart guy. I think so imagine what it does to the masses

492
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,840
Which is exactly why I wrote to these topics

493
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,600
The channel for video I went and dug around in there is supported by the Kato Institute

494
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,840
Which is a right wing think tank that was founded by Charles cock

495
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,280
Cock cock cock cock

496
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:39,000
Charles cock co-owner of coach industries the largest privately held oil company in the US and heavily funded by Exxon

497
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,440
The three scientists at the Kato Institute have been trying to tear down climate science and helped and helps from the

498
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,080
And helped form the Bush administration's early policy framework

499
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,400
Regarding climate change

500
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,480
They've been doing a good job of creating a veil of debate and confusion about climate science

501
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,200
Which keeps the public not knowing which way to turn when people are in certain they won't act

502
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,720
This is the goal of the Kato Institute and people like them and and the email goes on and

503
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
There's explanations and

504
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
You know

505
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,840
Well, here's the question. Do you really believe Thomas?

506
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,240
How am I doing on time here?

507
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,040
Let me see how I'm doing with the satellite wind up fall shit

508
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,400
Almost there

509
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,240
Thomas, do you truly believe that the Bush administration

510
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,560
would

511
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,120
harm the environment purposefully? I for profit. I guess that's what you're saying

512
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,840
only because of oil. I mean

513
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,960
Do you really think that?

514
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,480
And you may and and and and if you have any reasoning behind that, I'd love to hear it. You know, it

515
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,840
If it's just money and it really is that bad

516
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,680
Man, then that would be incredibly evil

517
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,240
So this week is a little difficult for me to really hone in on

518
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,440
On this issue if you have a comment about it, please send it

519
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,160
You know, call the voice mail line actually. Let me just give you a reminder in case you forgot the number

520
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,080
I

521
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,960
We'd be highly appreciated so that we can just keep this going while I am not able to spend as much time as I'd like to but

522
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:43,000
I have been I have been reading up on on the plane as I promised I bought a book called a globalization

523
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,400
Which if you're listening to serious satellite radio stars one or two you won't be able to hear

524
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,640
Talk about that because we're about to cut off the source code for today. Well, let me just grab the book, okay

525
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
It's over here

526
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,200
What is it it's uh written by who wrote this?

527
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:11,560
Alex McGillavry McGillavry Gray McGillavry a brief history of globalization

528
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,600
Because of course the hypotheses of the movie the great

529
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,080
Global warming swindle is that it's really

530
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:30,680
Being perpetuated by the anti-globalization movement and I'm interested in that because what exactly is globalization and when did it start and

531
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,720
You know there's different theories about that

532
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,200
Some say it started in 1950s some say it started in

533
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,360
19 even as late as 1980s something 85 and

534
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,200
In this book, there's an example cited from 1870 and even earlier

535
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,640
So I just look in here. I'm looking at the the bookmark. I'm on page 24

536
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,040
So I got a little ways to go

537
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,880
Man, I think if there's anything else

538
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,480
We got to talk about that is do more more

539
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
No, I think that's kind of it

540
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,480
It's gonna be a nutty week, but I'll definitely have some some things to talk about

541
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,160
Every single day so Monday was I hope really the only day that it just kind of got out of control

542
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,880
I just couldn't do a show should be okay for the rest of the week though

543
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,320
Coming to you from New York as you know and I went to the PM and

544
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:39,160
You know punch at our comm slash music. I searched for New York and came up with two pages of just awesome stuff that

545
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,480
Really

546
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,120
Really kind of maybe feel like I was in New York City

547
