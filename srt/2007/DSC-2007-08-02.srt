00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey home fries, it's CC Chapman from accident hash, encouraging you to check out

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
BODOD.tv slash battle.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's one of the coolest battle events out there, and you can only find it at BODOD.tv.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hmm, 644, volunteer gliding school, Northern Ireland.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't have to check that out for Adam.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's see, it's at the R-A-F-Sireston Newark Nautspace.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's see, about how far is that going to be for Adam.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's see, that's not too bad, that's only 375 miles.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's like a hop skip and a jump in the Delta Sierra Charlie.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, by the way, this is Delta Sierra Charlie 644.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You got the DSC 643, and you said that you want more?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, who could it be?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But my man AC with the Charlie 644.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I like to think I'm flying, just enjoy it.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
On casting, it's not a hurry.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Waste to know this time when it shouldn't have been all.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Trying to drive the runway for runway streets.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You bring me all just like I was a feather.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
When you put it all together your heart to be.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If I knew then what I know now.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'd cheat suit your plans.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Then I found out.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And maybe I was born a loser.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And maybe you don't want me.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But all I ever tried to do is make it happy.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And now I'm going to lose you.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But that's okay for me.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So I have a wanted to do.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Just make it happy.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Baby watch out to beat so wicked.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Telling all these lies trying to suit.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So excuse me, if that's much ain't unravel.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Or wait you just to come with someone like me.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If I knew then what I know now.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'd tell I know your plans.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's time to round you again.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And maybe I was born a loser.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And maybe you don't want me.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But all I ever tried to do is make it happy.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And now I'm going to lose you.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But that's okay for me.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So I have a wanted to do.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Just make it happy.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You know you's crying for you.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Your build is great.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And maybe you don't want me.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But all I ever tried to do was make it happy.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And now I'm going to lose you.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But that's okay for me.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So I have a wanted to do.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Just make it happy.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And now I'm going to lose you.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But that's okay for me.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So I have a wanted to do.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just make it happy.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hi.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And maybe I was born a loser.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And maybe you don't want me.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But all I ever tried to do is make it happy.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And now I'm going to lose you.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's okay for me.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So I have a wanted to do.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Just make it happy.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can always leave it up.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Here's the time to make us all happy.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Excellent.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Sir talk.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Jericho.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
California.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I just want to be happy.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
She comes from Los Angeles.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm just reading from the pod safe.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Music network liner notes here.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll send just California her own edge to pop rocks.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
She's just released the five song EP and iTunes.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We'll also be releasing a full length album in the fall.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Really only a matter of time before we see Jericho in the mainstream of things.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I got to tell you.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I see you're in a lot of things already.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Mm-hmm.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you want to see it go to dailysourcecode.com.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Check out the link.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You'll see what I'm talking about.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hey, everybody.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It is episode number 644.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's late here in the UK.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Not really that late for the hours I've been keeping recently.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But it's a quarter past 10 in the evening.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And I'm doing one for you.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We're still going to squeak out for today.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Although tomorrow's football will also be a late night show.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So kind of adjusted for the mood and for the mood.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I had promised Patricia and myself really today.

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We're going to do something different because it's,

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, man, we've been almost going stir crazy in the house in the manner, of course.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I mean, it doesn't suck that bad.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But, you know, the weather has been, been rotten.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Her parents have been here for a little over a week now and still have,

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
well, just under a week to go.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And Patricia had a few things she wanted to do in Holland.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, so now you know what?

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Weather permitting.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll fly over and I'll pick up on Saturday.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So we did that.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And as you know, the good lady Patricia, although she loves to fly alone with me,

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
has a bad vibe about just the two of us crossing the channel.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So I took Captain Daniel along for the ride.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It was beautiful today.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It was what a fabulous, right?

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
In fact, it was so smooth.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It was almost boring.

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Really.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There was not one speck of turbulence at all.

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You know, it was take off at Farrow.

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So I think we were airborne about,

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
what is it about?

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
About 10 a.m. this morning.

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And, uh, flipped on the autopilot and a couple of adjustments.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And it was nice.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, there was no one in the sky.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The controllers were all really friendly.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
They were happy with some nice weather for a change.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We got all kinds of clearances, you know,

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
to fly overhead, Rotterdam.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We actually went up to Hilversum.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So that's where, you know, it's really close to end.

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In fact, it's easier to go into Hilversum.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Not to mention less complex, less hassle and certainly cheaper when it comes to landing fees.

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's like, I think Amsterdam is 250 euros these days.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Just to land and the Hilversum is almost like a contribution.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
In fact, that much rather fill up the gas tanks there,

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
because they're, they're like a club, you know,

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and they can use every single penny.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And it's literally pennies that they make on fuel.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So dropped right there.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Had a nice lunch outside.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It was good to see taxi Eric, good old T to the E.

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I reencame over.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
She's, uh, yet another beautiful bankman,

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
beautiful blonde bank manager.

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Well, it's not actually completely blonde.

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So there we were, hanging out.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We were in a good time.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
There was some glider activity going on.

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So goodbye to my lovely wife and Dan and I hop back in the Delta share

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and flew back.

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And it was, as I said, it was, you know,

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
like completely uneventful.

157
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We kind of came in.

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It was starting to rain here and there.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And to see, we wheels down at like a 330 quarter four.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And since then, I've been on the phone.

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And of course, now the in-laws are here.

162
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's just the in-laws and myself.

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, man, I love him dearly.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But wow, they got lots of questions.

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And they ask him, uh, the same question a lot.

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And now the dishwasher's broken.

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And it's like, yeah, it's like, oh, man.

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You know how it is within laws.

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
They're really sweet, though.

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So a little more mellow show.

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I would say, uh, then then you're normally used to just because.

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, frankly, I'm tired.

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And tomorrow morning, I'm out the door at 10, man.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's, uh, got all kinds of stuff going on in the city.

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's, it's, it's just going to be that way for a while longer.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Certainly until the 15th when the ladies and I head off, uh,

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
to upstate New York for the big curry reunion.

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Adam, this is Chris Christensen from the Amateur Traveler podcast.

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In light of the recent podcast award nomination,

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
it seemed a good time to remember to be thankful to you and to

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Pod Show for the help that you've gotten for the sport of the show,

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
which I'm sure helped get the numbers that led to the nominations.

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Thanks for that.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Rather than just call and pimped the show,

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I have an outtake from the show that will never play on the Amateur Traveler.

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That just for some reason, and I don't know why.

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I thought perhaps you and your listeners might enjoy this.

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is an outtake from the show on Kingston, Ontario.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And it's talking about the number of prisons they have in Kingston.

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Including what was previously Canada's only prison for women.

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Also called P4W.

192
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Until it was shut down, and now there's a nice penal museum there.

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Do you know what's going on here at Kingston?

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Sorry, that just kind of sounded bad.

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Penal museum, uh, I should probably rephrase that.

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There goes, there goes the clean deck.

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I, you know, I should do more penis jokes.

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That'll get me nominated.

199
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Awards of funny things.

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You know, there's the British Telecom, digital musical awards that are coming up in,

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I think it's September or October.

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And we actually did a live stream from them last year.

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We didn't have a lot of setup time, not a lot of promo time.

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So, you know, actually I thought the streams were great,

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
but we made some fundamental production mistakes.

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And really weren't able to bake anything out of the material that we had recorded.

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And so, you know, really couldn't have any extra shelf life with it.

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So you either saw the stream or you kind of missed it all.

209
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So we're doing that differently this year.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Now, they have a podcast award, which they also had last year.

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We had like zero influence over, you know, how the mechanics work of the award.

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And just actually had a really great call this evening with some folks over B.T.

213
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And I said, look, you know, if we really want to make this a real award,

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
we got to do some real things with it and make sure that it's like, you know, independent.

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And you know, let's not have mainstream shows nominated.

216
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You know, this is kind of like the independent thing you, you know,

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
you are beyond that independent tip of the vibe.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll convince them somehow.

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They want to do all the right stuff.

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So it would be great to have a really cool award that that is on, you know,

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
it's televised and it gets a lot of press.

222
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And it would be great to have someone who's really making a show out there.

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You know, beating the street, doing whatever they have to do and, you know,

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
just full of passion would be great to have someone like that win that award.

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And, you know, I come up on stage and accept the award.

226
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You know, like cool stuff.

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Because it's certainly a big to do, a big shabang.

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hey, I got this one from a number of people.

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Elton John, this is, I don't understand this.

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This kind of sounds like he was maybe misquoted.

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You know, one of these things that's just going to get around.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Now, the article is from the Sun, which is, you know, it's like the largest tabloid

233
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
newspaper in all of the United Kingdom.

234
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But, you know, this is something that all the gossip blogs and

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and everyone reads all over the world.

236
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And so this will be copied and this will be watered down and made even worse.

237
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But essentially, the headline is,

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the pop legends are Elton John wants the internet closed down.

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He claims it is destroying good music by saying and I quote from the Sun.

240
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The internet has stopped people from going out and being with each other, creating stuff.

241
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Instead, they sit at home and make their own records, which is sometimes okay,

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
but it doesn't vote well for long term artistic vision.

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's just a means to an end.

244
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Remember we were talking about old people.

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You know, and then Elton John's not that much older than I am.

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But this this reeks of like, you know, just old stupid old man stuff.

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If you really said it.

248
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And I find it a hard time thinking that he really was that, you know, shallow about it.

249
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But he says, I'm such a lullite when it comes to making music all I can do is write it to piano.

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And then, of course, the Sun is quick to point out sales of Elton's last album,

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
the Captain, the kid.

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We're disappointing.

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It barely shifted 100,000 copies.

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And in the past, Sir Elton has opposed illegal downloading of his music from the net.

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, whatever.

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's not about downloading.

257
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's just about, I don't think him understanding.

258
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And I, of course, agree in disagree.

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I disagree.

260
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I think, you know, what we're doing online is amazing.

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We're touching, you know, each other deep into hearts and souls.

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And the more often than you realize and exposing beautiful and ugly emotions all the time,

263
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
which, of course, completely feeds creativity.

264
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But yeah, you know, there's a lot of signal to signal to noise ratio is out of whack.

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And there's a lot of craps here.

266
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I think I've always said it's got to get a whole lot worse before it gets better.

267
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And maybe Sir Elton just can't see past the, the period of a whole lot worse.

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Because yeah, we have, it's going to be worse.

269
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There's a lot, a lot more fun stuff to come.

270
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Hi.

271
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And this is my world, one of your Italian guys.

272
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I was listening to your 640, the SC, and I see that you're getting busy with your chat

273
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
or a congratulation, I'm glad to find it.

274
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm calling you as well from my iPhone, which I love as well.

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And I remember something that you mentioned something about loving to receive book

276
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
from advisors.

277
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I have a good one because I was a reading one for my clients.

278
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And I know that this is going to be a little bit on the line of what you do in your business.

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This is called the balance scorecard from Robert Chaplin and David Norton.

280
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This is what talks all about metrics of how to get to busy and get things going,

281
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
especially for your chatters, maybe it's going to be a good point.

282
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But you have a problem with your business because you're very successful.

283
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm glad to hear and I love your shows.

284
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Listen to all of what you do.

285
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But I know that I'm sure that you will be loving to read this book.

286
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Anyway, congratulations and thanks.

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh man, don't know.

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Thank you.

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Thank you so much.

290
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I've heard of the book and I'll definitely, I'll order it through Amazon and get a copy.

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And as of, I have my cheat sheet here.

292
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll send me this.

293
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Prendi la pilorosa.

294
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There you go.

295
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Which means take the red pill, by the way.

296
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Let me see.

297
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
There were a couple of new stories that were relatively interesting.

298
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
When I'm out and about, I still have time to check the Google reader, the mobile version.

299
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Let me see.

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
We did the performers royalties, right?

301
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Did that yesterday.

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
A lot of, a lot of press coming out about, what is this?

303
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
How, I think this, this is like a Hollywood story.

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's talking about how consumers, I love it how they talk about consumers.

305
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How about just fucking audience?

306
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
How about people, dude?

307
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Consumers want professionally produced video.

308
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Okay.

309
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I think there may be some fatigue of YouTube stuff.

310
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But, you know, the bottle rocket shootin' out of the ass, I'm sorry.

311
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It just gets me every single time.

312
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I should try that myself one day.

313
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Don't hate the hell, hate the racer actor.

314
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Come on.

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Hey there, you trap on studs and studs.

316
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
This is Brett.

317
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And this is Emily.

318
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
From this in and out of the trap on podcast.

319
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And we're here to remind you to vote for us in the helping fitness category at podcastawards.com.

320
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's right.

321
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You can vote now to August 11th and you can vote once a day, every day.

322
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't know, baby.

323
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I think we're going to have a lot of trouble winning this time.

324
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Why that?

325
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Because there's another podcast in the same category for sex and the title.

326
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What?

327
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We maybe we should rename our podcast to sex and the art of the channel.

328
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah, or sin in the art of sex at the end.

329
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We'll just remember to go vote for sin in the art of triathlon at podcastawards.com.

330
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Vote for us.

331
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh, man.

332
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Throwing you with iPods, trapped each knee.

333
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Throwing your kid in.

334
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's just wrong.

335
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Let's go.

336
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

337
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Do you really mean us?

338
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Let's get an iPods, grab these knee.

339
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This is so not good.

340
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think we got to stop this.

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This whole pimping for votes.

342
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It just makes no sense.

343
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's just, what was that listing?

344
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
A Pacifico's hell away.

345
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Someone registered with a go daddy domain podcast circle jerk.com

346
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and pointed it towards the podcast awards.

347
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, yay.

348
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Let's see.

349
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This, you know, I was waiting for this type of comment to come in or this type of question.

350
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I thought it took quite a long time and I've been, you know, kind of quiet about this

351
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
because I've just been watching in the sidelines.

352
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But it's good that someone asked the question.

353
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I didn't visit as a command work.

354
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I was just going in for something.

355
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I saw last week.

356
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Apparently Michael Arlington's off the crunch was doubting on the blog.

357
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Whether I thought tech.net was actually a viable business any longer.

358
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And got in a whole hoopla with the boat, the CEO and Robert Skobel.

359
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And I was wondering what your take was on the whole matter.

360
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And how does a pot tech compare to a pot show of course.

361
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
All right, man.

362
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Take care and talk you later.

363
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Bye.

364
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Well, you know, I've been following that a little bit.

365
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I think it's kind of died down by now.

366
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But, you know, this is, it's a, I feel kind of bad because

367
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I know what it likes to be on.

368
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What it's like to be on the receiving end of, you know, some, some controversy.

369
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And, you know, it's like all companies,

370
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
uh, fuck stuff up, make mistakes, you know.

371
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And, and there's this little circle of, of blogginess and, and,

372
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
uh, it's like, you know, it's kind of like the tech news industry.

373
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It feels like it's resonating around itself and kind of whirling in,

374
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
in the same continuous circle.

375
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And the same people are all kind of talking to each other or

376
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
whatever, you know, whatever.

377
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But this stuff does get picked up by, by other people,

378
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
um, you know, considering, you know, it's in the way it's presented.

379
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You know, now we have, uh, was it valley wag?

380
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Um, so we have our own little, I don't know, kind of gossipy,

381
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
news, circuit type thing.

382
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And, you know, at the same time, there's like real employees working at companies

383
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and, uh, and, you know, and you can only,

384
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
uh, obviously that everyone works really hard and whatever they believe in,

385
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
whatever they're trying to do and all this stuff is kind of distracting.

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And it's, it kind of feels a little bit like armchair quarterbacking

387
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
in a way.

388
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Uh, but that, that's also kind of the entertainment value of it.

389
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's just, I, I wonder, you know, how big is the audience is really

390
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
entertained and entertained by these controversies.

391
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't think it's very big.

392
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't think a lot of people really care all that much.

393
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Um, I certainly watched lots of podcast programming.

394
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Because they seem to talk about me a lot.

395
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So that's fun.

396
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Um, but, uh, you know, it's like, if we're going to build an industry,

397
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
we're going to need a lot of different players and players with all kinds of different

398
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
expertise.

399
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So, um, it seems to me like, uh,

400
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
podcast has a reasonable, uh, business model.

401
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Um, it's not the same as, as pod shows.

402
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Um, and, uh, and I enjoy the programming.

403
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Uh, not always the production values, but I certainly enjoy a lot of what's being

404
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
said.

405
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And I'm a geek like that.

406
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So, you know, I kind of belong in the geek circle.

407
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And, and if that's the audience, then that's great.

408
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You know, that may be a very, very valuable audience.

409
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I just think it's a little small.

410
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So that, yeah, that's really it, you know.

411
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Uh, but, you know, this is just a lot of a lot of noise

412
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
spinning around.

413
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And I think people trying to, you know, get stuff to catch fire and

414
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
uh, I don't know.

415
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's all a part of, uh, what media is becoming.

416
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You know, we like to dissect things.

417
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Take things apart.

418
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You know, and doesn't really matter whether it's Brittany Spears or

419
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
John Furrier.

420
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh, my god.

421
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What kind of comparisons am I making?

422
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Hey, Adam.

423
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's Bernie.

424
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And you asked in DSC 643, if I would take on the task of putting

425
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
together a widget for you to play channels and windows.

426
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Unfortunately, they don't make a tinfoil hat in my size.

427
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm really more of a content guy, not that much of a gear head.

428
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But I am getting ready to set up some channels.

429
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Now, it might take me a little while.

430
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So I encourage you while you're waiting for me to get it all together.

431
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Smoke them if you got them.

432
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Thanks for thinking of me.

433
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Can't wait to see that channel, Bernie.

434
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
No, man, thanks.

435
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You know, that's cool.

436
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I got a couple other people who are, you know, working on some stuff.

437
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And it's not all that, uh, it's not trivial to do this in in

438
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Windows with iTunes.

439
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But, uh, you know, if someone out there is going to be able to

440
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
figure it out, you know, I'm sure they're going to let me know about it.

441
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And look forward to your channels.

442
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
In fact, you know, this thing has been stable.

443
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It seems to be working.

444
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I got to tell you, uh, it's really saved my life when it comes to staying

445
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
current on episodes.

446
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Um, you know, there's much less to wade through.

447
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I can, you know, just pull up the, the XML of the, you know, the feed.

448
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I can pull it up on my iPhone that works perfectly.

449
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I have been religiously sinking with iTunes so far, so

450
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
good.

451
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Probably because the channels are now limited.

452
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You know, you don't have tons of episodes coming through.

453
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So it really, yeah, it is kind of working for me.

454
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So I hope it's working for for anyone else who's put a channel

455
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
together.

456
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Um, I think we're going to put the get channel functionality in

457
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
sometime next week.

458
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I think we're ready for it.

459
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Everything else seems to be working.

460
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So, uh, and now that, of course, is one stuff gets to get,

461
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
it starts to get really exciting.

462
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Um, one of the play this year, yesterday, but after the whole

463
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
young, polite thing, uh, didn't really feel up to it.

464
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But there's a new band on the podcast music network.

465
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And, uh, my good friend, uh,

466
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Petty Love is going to tell you all about it.

467
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey, Adam Petty Love from Lovehouse Radio.

468
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
For the past two years, I've been

469
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
according to band Carbon Leaf to post music on the PMN

470
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and share it with the podcasting world.

471
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You might recognize Carbon Leaf.

472
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
They hold the distinction as being the first

473
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
unsigned band to win an American Music Award

474
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and perform in the AMAs.

475
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Aside from that honor, they have created

476
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
some great music and developed quite a following in the

477
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
States.

478
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Well, and from a personal note, I just happened to have

479
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
gone to college with several of the band members.

480
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Anyway, in my attempts to get them on the PMN,

481
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I started making some headway

482
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and explaining what podcasting and pot safe music

483
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
were and kind of leave the whole concept around it.

484
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
A couple of months ago, they said they would

485
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
reach out to the record company, Vanguard records

486
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
to see if there were any objections.

487
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Well, in order to strike when the iron was hot,

488
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I put together a show dedicated to their music

489
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
based on some previous permissions they gave me

490
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
to play their music on Lovehouse Radio.

491
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
With that, I created a contest

492
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
based on listener sending emails

493
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
to the band, urging them to make some of their music

494
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
pod safe.

495
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Well, finally it worked.

496
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
With just one email to Terry in the band,

497
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
he responded and said that they

498
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
cleared everything with their record label

499
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and had posted several songs in the pod safe

500
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
music network.

501
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So to celebrate this task, this feat,

502
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I asked that you obliged me by playing

503
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
the song they performed on the American Music Awards.

504
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The song is called The Boxer,

505
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and it's a good representation of what

506
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Carbon Leaf has to offer.

507
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
A lot of musical talent, a lot of vocal talent,

508
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and just a lot of variety.

509
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So Adam, if you could have obliged me,

510
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I would have appreciated it,

511
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and I'm sure the band would have appreciated it

512
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
if we had a chance to share with your listeners

513
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
a little carbon leaf.

514
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So here's The Boxer.

515
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:58,000
We could have asked for a better day

516
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
to buy two to the ring to the right.

517
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'd up here, we'd retreat to the corner

518
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
that's the fine tie you to the ring to the right.

519
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The point of the ring,

520
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
the point of the ring,

521
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
the point of the ring,

522
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
the point of the ring,

523
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
the point of the ring,

524
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
the point of the ring,

525
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
the point of the ring,

526
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
the point of the ring,

527
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
the point of the ring,

528
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
the point of the ring,

529
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
the point of the ring,

530
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
the point of the ring,

531
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
the point of the ring,

532
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
the point of the ring,

533
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
the point of the ring,

534
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
the point of the ring,

535
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
the point of the ring,

536
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
the point of the ring,

537
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
the point of the ring,

538
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
the point of the ring,

539
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
the point of the ring,

540
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
the point of the ring,

541
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
the point of the ring,

542
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
the point of the ring,

543
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
the point of the ring,

544
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
the point of the ring,

545
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
the point of the ring,

546
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
the point of the ring,

547
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The passion left to burn

548
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The boxers go with me

549
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Their eyesight breaks

550
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Now we remain

551
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Sheels the boxers she knows

552
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
When and where to strike

553
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
He is the boxer he knows

554
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
No peaceful sleep to night

555
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
While twilight on the front smoke

556
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He will box a standing tall

557
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Here in through binding

558
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
No one around the fight

559
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
What to do to the ring to the right

560
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Point of view

561
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Long we remain

562
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Sheels the boxers she knows

563
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
When and where to strike

564
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Heels the boxer he knows

565
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
No peaceful sleep to night

566
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000

Long we remain

571
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Long we remain

572

Long we remain

Long we remain

Long we remain

577
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Long we remain

578
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000

Long we remain

583
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Long we remain

584
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Long we remain

Long we remain

590
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Long we remain

591
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Long we remain

592
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Long we remain

593
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,240
and Twitter posts. We've been trying to reach him since we were alerted, but so far

594
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,560
I've had no luck. We've been in contact with the highway patrol down there and are anxious

595
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,960
to hear of his whereabouts. This is a very, very serious situation. And I've been totally

596
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,360
disgusted by the heartless comments and the terrible treatment Nick has received from some

597
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:12,080
of those in the podcast in community. Why must some people have to tick? Why must some people

598
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,880
have to tear others down to the point of total destruction before they realize that they

599
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,640
behave you could have deadly repercussions? Does it make you feel good hurting other people?

600
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,600
Are you truly that pathetic? We hope that Nick is safe and offer whatever help he needs to

601
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,320
get to a better place. I just pray it isn't too late. Man, this is a serious shit going on here.

602
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,880
Okay, so I don't know the backstory to this, but I guess some elements within the quote podcast

603
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,760
in community have been really mean to the guy. Now, if you read the Twitter posts, this is like,

604
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,720
this is pretty scary. So, you know, it's like, it's all from the last 24 hours and he's talking

605
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,080
about, I'm a fat mess. No wonder I haven't been on dating for years. I'm pretty drunk. Now,

606
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,120
consider anything from here on out, a drunk Twitter post and then a little bit further on

607
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,760
finally made it to my coffee shop. busy day was in the newspaper and cop talked to me last night

608
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,320
about being homeless. There's a nice high skyway bridge nearby. I've heard of plenty of people

609
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,200
jumping from it. Maybe I should give it a try tonight. And then, you know, you move up a like two hours.

610
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,600
All right, I'm out Twitter. Time to catch a few more drinks and debate jumping from a bridge tonight.

611
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,360
Sunshine skyway bridge here I come. The next one, just paid the toll for the skyway bridge.

612
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,640
Should I stop at the top? What should I do with my car? I guess I leave it there.

613
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,160
Then the next one, has there ever been a Twitter suicide before? I wonder what I would write as I'm

614
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:44,240
falling to my death? And then the last post, the last Twitter tweet or whatever the frickie

615
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,200
call it. All right, this is it. Part my car. I wish everyone who was ever nice to me well.

616
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,840
See you in the next life. Posted 20 hours ago. And then that's messed up.

617
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,280
This needs further investigation. Now, I'm going to call Don and Drew and find out what's going on.

618
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,480
And I'll update you tomorrow. It may be a very food bard Friday. I certainly hope Nick is okay.

619
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,960
That's messed up. All right, DaddySourceco.com. You can find the link to all that stuff over there.

620

And Adam at podshow.com. If you have anything else for me, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

621
