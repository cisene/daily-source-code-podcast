Hey Adam, I think I know where the problem is

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
with thinking that the Trinity Project is a green project.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000

Now all of the DSC-554.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In a world where TV networks, movie studios and record labels

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
still think they can govern what you see in here.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and make big media corporations wet their tiny little pants.

Pete Hopkins, become from the pod safe music network like you didn't know that because you've heard it before on this show.

93
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,400
I love that song. Hey, everybody. How you doing? It is daily source code episode five five four coming to you.

94
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:49,240
Once again from the Curry condo and no cow, that is nor the California for those of you not a no tomorrow triple five.

95
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,520
That should be kind of interesting. Open. I get some openers for that. I just got back from I'm sorry.

96
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:07,800
I'm over modulating all over the place tonight. I just got back from from the city from the theater. I know less and I have quite a story to tell about my evening out an evening of culture for the pod boy.

97
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:18,760
Man, I'm I'm you know what I want I want I want to tell you exactly what I did and why I'm so excited and I just had a great night out and

98
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:29,480
And you definitely want to hear about this because it's one of those weird connections that only through pod casting is this all come about and it's it's just it's messing with my head.

99
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,320
But almost I can do I hear music somewhere.

100
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,480
Uh, that's kind of interesting.

101
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,720
Hmm.

102
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,840
I'm not quite sure where it's coming from. Did you hear that? I swear to God I could hear music running in the background.

103
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,120
Anyway, uh, sorry about that little distracted.

104
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,160
Here's uh, this is uh, this relates to my evening. This first comment. Check it out.

105
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:04,200
Hi Adam. It's Ralph. I forgot here. Uh, I haven't spoken to you in an quite a while on the where you have played one through message from me in the past.

106
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:11,240
I was really interested to listen to you know some of your recent episodes because obviously you're now playing

107
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,040
Non-pod safe music and I remember way because I've been listening to for ages way back

108
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:25,080
When you would you used to play quite a lot of non-pod safe music and then I vow that you never would do it again

109
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,960
So I'm really curious to know what you're thinking is behind playing a lot of these classic tunes. Yes, they're classic tunes and yes

110
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:40,040
I'm sure the you playing them will definitely help their sales. I kind of imagine we do otherwise it seems to me quite logical

111
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,440
But aren't you opening yourself up to a realistic friend of getting sued by somebody

112
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,120
for playing music that's said non-pod safe or is that something you thought of when you're prepared to take that chance?

113
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,640
Or do you actually want them to sue you? Do you get something that needs to to be fleshed out in the courts?

114
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,440
I'm just really curious to understand some of you thinking because I'm sure you must have thought long and hard about

115
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,520
Going back to playing non-pod safe music again after being quite in fatigue about not doing it any longer.

116
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:15,320
Sometime ago anyway, I love the show as I think I've made a mission before still remain a folder all the best. All right

117
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:24,440
So thank you very timely with that comment and obviously you've heard me play a couple of non-pod safe tunes over the past a few weeks

118
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
There's a new segment in the show

119
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,840
Another track from Adam's first gen iPod which can be a non-pod safe song

120
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Let me start off by saying I am quite aware that I'm breaking

121
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,760
The rules or probably even more accurate to say I'm breaking the law

122
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,200
But of course I break the law in many

123
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
Hold on

124
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,880
There we go. Ah fucking noise get you can't hear half of what I'm doing

125
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,880
I know I'm breaking the law. I've broken the law while speeding

126
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,600
These aren't all comparable but I'm very aware what's right and what's wrong

127
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,200
But here's the problem and by the way you'll probably only hear me playing non-pod safe music

128
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
That is from my past and

129
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,520
I think just about every single time that I've played and just an awesome song

130
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,240
The reason why is because I can't help myself I it's

131
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,800
Music

132
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,240
All music that I know in from my entire career my life

133
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,600
It's a part of me. It's a part of my DNA and I have to say it's what I do

134
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
What I do is I

135
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:40,520
Always been someone who's shared music with others millions millions of others whether it was on the radio on MTV

136
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,840
And particularly on the radio I have to say I'm a disk jockey. I'm a disk jockey because I have all the launch well

137
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,840
I album sushi

138
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,600
A disk jockey is something it's it's an art form that has been dead for probably

139
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,560
I'm gonna say almost 20 years

140
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,600
Hmm maybe a little less, but it's really been dead for the past 10 and let me try and explain

141
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:16,440
All these music services that that are out there and there's a ton of music services and you know like iTunes

142
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Where you can create mixes

143
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,760
There's a Napster which I like very much which I subscribe to there's the Yahoo music engine

144
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,960
There's

145
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,360
Rhapsody you name it it's out there and

146
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,840
And

147
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
The problem is

148
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Is that there's what are these services have a million and a half songs in their entire catalog?

149
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,160
Which isn't not too bad, obviously, but discovery of songs

150
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,600
Is happening through machines and this is

151
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,520
Yeah, it's part of a way to help people discover new music

152
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:55,240
But it's definitely not the best or most effective way what we saw with the original Napster

153
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,280
Was oh my gosh, you know now we're really sharing songs people were ripping their CDs

154
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Which they bought presumably and

155
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,360
They were putting the MP3s online and you could go in and I think that was one of the biggest features of Napster

156
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,320
Is you could go into someone's shared folder and see what else they had because if you'd like this

157
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,960
You know the music you were finding from this person which presumably you searched for in the first place

158
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,560
And you'd probably like the other things and you know that was really one of the first social media networks in my opinion

159
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:33,080
So that works extremely well when you as just a fan of music can tell your buddies your friends check this shit out

160
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,480
And do we have proof that that is true? Yes, multiple

161
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:46,840
Multiple examples how about my space just in general? I mean my space was a place where you you slapped up a player of your band's music

162
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:53,080
And it was embeddable genius by the way so that other people could then put your song on there my space page

163
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,360
Podcasting exactly the same now

164
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,480
I have to say that pod save music sprouted from a little different background

165
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,920
It was Ron blew in myself getting together and saying look here's this podcasting

166
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,400
And it's working very well with speech and it's very effective for that

167
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,560
But there's just something missing from the equation and

168
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,560
Ron's a musician. I'm a broadcaster. Sorry. I'm a disco jockey. I'll just say it

169
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
And

170
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:33,160
I desperately want to play songs in music and I want to share that with my buddies and Ron says well, I want to get paid and after a lot of research

171
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,160
We came up with the idea for the pod sake music license now part of the another reason

172
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:47,160
For getting this together is you know, I knew certainly the time when podcasting was just cranking up in its

173
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,760
Current incarnation of audio on the internet

174
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I knew that if we were playing

175
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Licensed music

176
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Particularly at that juncture in time. I knew that there was a very high likelihood

177
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,040
That one of us probably me would it be singled out and that we would branded pirates and

178
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,560
That podcasting would really in the media's eye

179
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,880
Be seen as a bunch of pirate radio stations on the internet now we have far surpassed that point

180
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,480
We've gotten to the point where and this is the hypocrisy of it all and I love following the money

181
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,560
If you want to know what's happening you just got to look at the money

182
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,800
There are only four big record labels now

183
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,640
All the independence pretty much get it they understand that the way to move music the way to market it the way to package it is to let people

184
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,440
Share it with their friends and podcasters sometimes have a shitload of friends who listen very intensely to their shows

185
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,920
And

186
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,400
in podcasting we've proven time and time again that you do sell music if you if a song is played on a podcast

187
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
The hypocrisy of the four majors

188
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,920
Is that whenever they've got something to promote that benefits their agenda which means new current music

189
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:14,200
Because that's really all that they focus on when it comes to record sales the record sales divisions not the music licensing, but the record sales divisions

190
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Um

191
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,960
They're very happy to say hey man go ahead go ahead and play it don't worry about it. You won't get in trouble. I'll make sure I'll get you covered

192
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
Yeah, so

193
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,440
You know, obviously they understand the value as well, but no one can quite get past the lawyers

194
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,840
Now the music that I from time to time will play and I and again I just can't help myself

195
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:48,120
I do because it's it's my art. It's my art form to let you know how I'm feeling as it relates to a story or maybe something that's going on in the world

196
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:55,720
Or maybe just the weather or whatever it is and I believe that it's a real way to communicate and

197
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,520
Being able to choose the music that I want to play for you regardless of what it is is is

198
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,760
Virtually Nirvana it is it is what I love to do

199
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,160
Now I realize that pure music shows very very hard to maintain an audience

200
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,160
In podcasting. That's why I only play one or two songs throughout the entire show also I got shit to say

201
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,680
And it also makes it that much more special you know

202
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,680
I focus a lot of attention on the songs that I play. It's not just really nearly

203
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,160
You know, I really think about this stuff and I get a shit load of submissions

204
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,160
So

205
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,160
I just can't help myself and I think it's really important that

206
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,240
Maybe I just take that role upon myself. I want to make sure that all this great music which is now sitting in huge archives

207
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,160
Digital archives not even in stores stores almost no longer exist we can go and buy this music

208
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,400
There's almost no way to discover all the great great songs that I grew up with and

209
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,480
And the people that I know I love sharing those stories and it's no different from from what's happening now

210
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,640
It's exactly the same. You know will we be talking about a Matthew evil and a slow and

211
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,080
Carmen Tyler will we talking about these people

212
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,120
Ten years now of course you will and podcasts. There's will have the same stories that I have now about

213
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,440
You know aerosmith and and Von Jovi and the Rolling Stones

214
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,520
And the kings even god. I'm dating myself. Okay

215
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,000
So it's important and it's important that people who

216
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,600
Listen to the daily source code get some kind of education

217
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,320
I mean I'm talking so much shit anyway. Let me give you an example here's an email that I received from Cassandra

218
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,440
Hey Adam with your newfound willingness to risk playing non-pod save music on occasion why not

219
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,320
Hit up yon the food bar Friday hit test

220
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:57,640
Well, yes, and I have had conversations with with representatives from all of the dig four labels about doing exactly that

221
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Same thing came back they love it

222
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,000
Fantastic we're not gonna make any ways, but of course we're not gonna

223
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,800
Publicly allow and you say that will allow you to do that

224
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,960
Cassandra goes on saying I missed the hit test so much

225
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,800
That thing was my favorite part of the show back in the summer of 2005

226
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,960
I listened to the source code loud as hell on my stereo in my room while I played PC games and every time

227
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,920
There was a new hit test. It just got louder now

228
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,960
I don't actually know any of the music on the hit test

229
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,920
I was born in 1986 so I was a bit young for the 80s music, but I always loved to hear the hit test because it's just so incredibly

230
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,760
Awesome and fun every time and I learned something about music past

231
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,320
And a few times I went to go buy one of the songs and iTunes bingo there you go the circle

232
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,920
It's complete that is exactly what I'm talking about

233
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,840
I hope you understand what I'm saying now I'm not giving up my support for pod save music because it doesn't matter to me

234
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,280
It's music and I love it and I love playing new music

235
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,000
I think the only safe thing to do here is just stay away from the new stuff that

236
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,240
The record companies are trying to sell I get it I understand that and quite frankly you've got your own ecosystem for that

237
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,160
And I'm not interested really although there are some songs that I hear on the radio that I'd love to play to let me tell you

238
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,200
There's still some great music being made just this mainstream doesn't mean it's crap and I'm here to service you

239
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,440
Hey, you know what that's the ultimate answer. It's my job to service you to entertain you

240
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,960
And if that means going to jail so be it

241
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,320
Okay, now now that what happened this evening? Oh, man, well how much time do I have six minutes?

242
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,760
Okay, yeah, I can I can get it in for the people listening on serious satellite radio

243
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Beginning of the month I received this comment. I'm just gonna replay it for you because

244
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,080
Well, it's it's the beginning of a very interesting story

245
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:58,840
Hi Adam it's Eric Bergen. You might remember my name. I'm the host of green room radio and arts and entertainment podcast and in fact

246
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,800
We were one of the first podcasts to feature a theme song by Jeff Smith

247
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,080
Anyway, here's why I'm sending in this audio comment

248
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,480
I was very involved in the podcasting world almost since the beginning in fact

249
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,960
That was one of your first listeners and I was a dedicated listener. I listened every single day

250
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,480
In August

251
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,840
I made the decision to stop listening

252
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,960
This was in about early to mid August and the decision came out of the fact that my other life which was that of an actor

253
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,360
Actually started picking up steam and I started getting work and I was in rehearsals all day and doing shows at night

254
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,560
And I just didn't have time for podcasting anymore. I haven't done an episode of my own podcasts since May

255
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,440
Don't worry we're coming back next week, but I just

256
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
I just need to know

257
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,040
I need a little update because I want to rejoin the daily source code listening experience

258
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,960
But I need to know what's going on. I can't just join the show and not know what's going on

259
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:03,960
Did you move it sounded like you moved houses? What's this free Trinity thing? I need if you could just give me or maybe one of your listeners

260
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,760
Could give me just a three minute update of

261
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:14,200
Everything I need to know that's been happening in the daily source code world since I guess mid August the last time I checked in

262
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,440
August the pod show website had just gone public

263
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,440
But I think that's that was really the biggest thing that was going on then so if you could just just let me know

264
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,160
Just catch me up on everything and I'm sorry to ask you I just I want to rejoin

265
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,280
But I can't just rejoin and not know what's going on. It's like trying to

266
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,040
Join

267
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,240
24 in the middle of the season. You don't know what the hell's going on

268
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Also next time you're in San Francisco

269
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:50,440
I'm here for a while doing a little show called jersey boys playing at the current theater and and I know Adam that you sort of are a jersey boy because you you live there

270
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,920
Now

271
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,440
The show isn't about you the show is actually about Frankie Valley in the four seasons

272
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,160
But I'd love for you to come we're playing at the current theater right on Gary Street. It's right near pod show HQ

273
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,960
So why don't you come on down? I'll pay for your ticket. I promise

274
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,400
Okay, that's all just someone give me an update. Please

275
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,720
All right, so Eric sends that comment in and I have to say hilarity ensued because it was pretty funny and you know

276
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,080
There were some updates that came in which I'm not gonna play for you now, but it was good

277
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,040
So you know you you heard there that he

278
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,480
Was host of the green green room radio. It's green room radio. I think yeah green room radio podcast

279
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,320
And that he's an actor. Okay, so and remember this is

280
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,760
What is this this is a February fifth of February six something like that when this came in

281
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:42,520
Amazing because still find it and and so he's you know, he's working this show

282
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,240
Jersey boys so I actually hear about this show. You know, it's a big Broadway smash

283
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,560
It's about the life and times of Frankie Valley and the four seasons. I'm like okay, you know, this is great

284
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,720
So I was supposed to go last Tuesday as you know my trip was delayed. I still haven't been able to tell you why

285
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,840
But that's also forthcoming maybe by food bar for lucky and

286
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,600
And I completely forget about about the tickets so he sends me an email. He says, hey, I don't

287
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,760
I heard on the show that you know that you're delayed your your trip has been delayed

288
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,120
Shall I move it till next week? I'm like, oh fuck man. I'm so sorry really apologize. Thanks for for checking in with the yes

289
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,480
I'd love to so tickets were a one ticket was ready for me this evening at the current theater

290
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,480
Folgers with splendor. I love it. It's a fantastic combination

291
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:36,760
So I haven't been to the theater in in a while. It's nice theater by the way the current so

292
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,320
You know after a while not not not after work work never ends, but around seven I get picked up because I know it should be there

293
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:49,160
We'll call by seven thirty because pretty busy. I'm telling you pretty busy. It's sold out. I mean this this is like I'm okay

294
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,360
Wow, this is pretty interesting now because I had one ticket and and of course Eric. Thank you

295
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,960
You know there's a high likelihood that you're going to get put next to someone else who had one ticket and

296
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,520
I was there a nice new on time and the theater hadn't filled up yet and I sit down next to a gentleman who I think was

297
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,280
Probably in his late 80s and

298
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,640
You know, I say hi doing and I said, yeah, it looks like

299
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,640
We're the only guys with no dates here tonight and it was a beautiful guy

300
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Who lost his wife a couple years ago

301
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,920
He lives on the embarked era. He comes to the theater and he loves the musicals because

302
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,440
All dialogue really goes too fast for him to process although I had no problem communicating with him

303
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,720
He said, you know, it's not a matter of not being able to hear. I just can't process it fast enough

304
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,000
But I love the songs

305
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I love musicals because you know, I can go with the flow here. There you go music

306
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,560
I can go with the flow of the music whether I recognize it or not and it just makes me feel really happy

307
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
It was nice. You know, I had a nice chat with this guy

308
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,440
And he's like he said, hey, yeah, no date

309
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,880
So we get into stuff. We're just talking and he says so how come you're here? I said well

310
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,080
someone who's in in the play and in this musical got me a ticket

311
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,840
And says name is Eric and I pick up the play bill and

312
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:14,760
Yeah, we're just chatting away and I'm looking I'm actually going to the page now and what is the the title of the page?

313
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,480
Let me see, let me just get to it here. Hey folks on serious satellite radio. I'm so sorry

314
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,000
I can't get this story in within within within a lot of times

315
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,160
You can have to go to dailysourceco.com

316
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,240
Download the rest because it's really it's really worth it. And you'll hear some great music

317
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,480
So I see here's the here's the credits if you wills have it they call it the credits page

318
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,680
Jersey boys the story of Frankie Valley in the four seasons

319
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:49,000
Book by Marshall Brickman and Rick Ellis or at least music by Bob Godio more about that in a minute

320
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:56,120
lyrics by Bob crew with Eric Bergen Michael Ingersol Christopher Cale Jones and Devon May

321
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,720
Dude, he's not in this he's fucking starring in it so I'm like you know going through the play bill

322
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,360
And sure enough you've got the who's who's in the cast who's who in the cast listen to this

323
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:13,080
You've got a kick out of this Eric Bergen who plays Bob Godio now Bob Godio was the man who wrote

324
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:20,680
just an amazing amount of fantastic hits for Frankie Valley in the Ford not just for Frankie Valley in the four seasons

325
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:26,600
But for many other artists as well and it wasn't until he joined the four seasons that are really

326
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,880
kicked into gear in the combination Bob Godio and Frankie Valley that's really what the magic was

327
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,360
It still is actually I should say so Eric Bergen plays Bob Godio

328
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,280
Eric is a recent non graduate of the North Carolina School of the Arts

329
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,480
Eric is thrilled to finally be making his agent some money and to be part of the Jersey boys family

330
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,720
Other recent credits around the country include white Christmas the three musketeers and warrior

331
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,920
Eric is also the producer and host of green room radio an arts and entertainment podcast at

332
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:03,480
www.greenroomradio.com all the love and thanks to mom and dad whatever you guys did seems to have worked

333
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:11,640
Please visit Ericbergen.com for more info and that's E-E-E-R-I-C-H Bergen dot com so I'm like oh, okay

334
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,560
This is really quite amazing. Let me tell you

335
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,320
Not and and this is of course why I'm on this whole

336
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:26,200
Musical educational trip because by the way the audience was pretty old I mean definitely skewed old there was a lot of

337
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,600
You know people probably in their 50s

338
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,640
Who would and and 50s and 60s I would say who would definitely witness

339
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:40,120
Frankie Valley in the four seasons and by the way when you hear some of the songs if you you know

340
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,760
If you'll just take a moment and go to iTunes and listen to some of the previews or if you have some kind of music

341
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,840
Service just you know type in Frankie Valley in the or the four seasons Frankie Valley and that's V-A-L-L-I

342
00:26:51,800 --> 00:27:00,360
And and you'll recognize these songs probably from the third or fourth version or the third or fourth time that it was a hit and cover versions

343
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
This story is indeed about

344
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
Frankie Valley and

345
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,640
And and and what's so nice about it of course the Frankie in the four seasons are from Jersey and

346
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,440
You know indeed. I'm from Jersey and

347
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,400
You what came across so well in in this piece is

348
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,520
What Jersey guys or Jersey boys are like?

349
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,640
famously Frankie Valley and Bob Gaudio

350
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,960
Sealed their professional relationship on a handshake and

351
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,880
They always agreed you know this is how we're gonna roll with it from from this day on and to this day indeed

352
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
They they still have you know a handshake agreement

353
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,520
It's such a Jersey boy thing the way they talked. I mean it came across so well

354
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,760
I completely connected it's also a very very physical

355
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,520
Peace of work

356
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:05,880
There's a catwalk so you really have two levels of the stage and every single actor is is moving pieces of set in and out

357
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,800
I mean the scene changes there's there must be a hundred of them and it goes so quick because the actors are actually

358
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
moving the set pieces in

359
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,080
The lighting is fantastic sound amazing

360
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Absolutely amazing

361
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:29,160
The singing oh gosh. I got to tell you it was really it was just enjoyable

362
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,640
Let's see it's

363
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,240
Christopher Kale Jones who plays a Frankie Valley fantastic voice and I don't know how these guys do it

364
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,400
Because you know they're miked with theatrical mics which are kind of hidden on their head or in their hair

365
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,280
And it was pretty clear to me that the microphones that we're using on stage were just props and

366
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:54,680
It must be very hard to sing a song hold a microphone but not to really have the direct relationship between what's coming out of your mouth and the mic and fun of you

367
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
You know thing is stuck to your head basically

368
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,960
I just I don't know how they do that

369
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,480
Devon May who plays a Tommy DeVito who kind of founded the group

370
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,880
Great actor award winning actor. I might add just amazing performance and

371
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:17,000
And Michael Inger saw who plays Nick Massey just everyone in the cast was fantastic. There was another guy there

372
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,000
What's his name and all you know

373
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:30,280
In a couple of songs all of a sudden you'd you'd hear this incredible voice and I'm looking around like where's it coming from and this this guy would be on the stage again

374
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,280
And he was just ripping it up. It was so good

375
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,240
Um

376
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,240
Not anyway, so if you have it it's a pretty hot ticket so you may not you know you can probably see it in Vegas

377
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,920
You can see it on Broadway

378
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,760
It would be nice if you were able to see it in San Francisco. I'm sure this is the traveling show

379
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,560
So I don't know when or where they're going next

380
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,480
But it is a show that we'll teach you something because even I was saying oh crap

381
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,920
I forgot all about that song. I didn't or didn't even know that

382
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,680
That it was a frankie valley in the four seasons song. I mean

383
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Even though I know every single one of the songs the memory is so limited so it's really important that

384
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:18,680
You know that we keep reminding ourselves of what what great songs have been created and as the story goes throughout the evening

385
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,440
All the songs

386
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,440
Come at it the exact moment and in the exact circumstances that the song was written

387
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:35,720
And at one point frankie valley separates from his wife and and she's a sweetheart

388
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,680
But you know, it's a show business, right? It got all messed up and that's when

389
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,000
Bob Goody writes this song for frankie valley and

390
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Just hearing it on stage

391
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,960
It was uncanny man

392
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,680
It was so beautiful when you listened to the lyrics and know the backstory that

393
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,200
He was trying to make and show business and it wrecked his home life

394
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
And yet so far

395
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
Carried your books from school

396
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,360
Played maple in your marriage and he

397
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,400
He worked the great hour six when we came to me

398
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Walk at home every day

399
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Overbound a good bridge

400
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,840
And wait until we go into the near you

401
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,240
When our separate way

402
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
My

403
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,480
Forever lay the hand on your mind

404
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,160
Like the name of the way for me you couldn't see how I taught

405
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:20,760
So close, so close and yet so far

406
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Beautiful city lights

407
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,680
Clung the ladder of the fortune and fame

408
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,080
Worked my fingers to the bone

409
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,880
Make my self-ename

410
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,880
For the icing to find

411
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,080
But no matter how the news on the one

412
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,080
Still I reminisce about the girl I miss

413
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,880
And the love I let behind

414
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Mines a toy

415
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,960
But we'll never let a hand on your mind

416
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,960
And don't

417
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,560
Like the name of the way for me you couldn't see how I taught

418
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,000
So close, so close and yet so far

419
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,040
Mines a toy

420
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,160
But no matter how the news on the one

421
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,040
Still I reminisce about the girl I miss

422
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,640
Like the name of the way for me you couldn't see how I taught

423
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:40,680
So close, so close and yet so far

424
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,120
Mines a toy

425
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,600
Don't worry about the way for me you couldn't see

426
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Mines a toy

427
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,320
Like the name of the way for me you couldn't see how I taught

428

You know I have like promo as all kinds of stuff I wanted to play that I'm just going to leave that until tomorrow
