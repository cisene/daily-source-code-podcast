1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You've been your Scarborough Wal-Mart Supercenter.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good morning, so pretend to want my call back to you.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, hi, my name is Adam Curry.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm in a funny situation right now.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm calling from my cell phone.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm in the man's toilet room and there's no more like toilet paper.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Can someone bring some toilet papers?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Uh, we want the front to back.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The one that closes to the McDonald's there.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
McDonald's, okay.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, just a second.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, sorry.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Can this person bring something to read like,

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't know, maybe a magazine, something like a Mary Claire

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
or because it's kind of boring in here.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, you know, sorry if it is a magazine like if it is not paid for doing a lot too.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Delta share Charlie five, five, six.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sixty million dollars worth of airplane strap to my ass.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Sorry, I didn't listen to it.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We working with our set.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Sorry that I spent so much time living in my head.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Sorry, I gave you everything.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Do you know I would do anything for you?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Did you stay too long?

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sorry anymore.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
For the way I was before.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And as far as I can turn I think we fell.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We fell.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We fell.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not sorry anymore.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There's a change you can't think more.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There's a lesson to be learned.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I simply fell.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Must have said I'm sorry.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A hundred thousand times.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Everything that I'm to blame tonight,

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I apologize.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I was wrong.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Did you stay too long?

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Did you stay too long?

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sorry if I'm boring you.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm getting in your way.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Sorry maybe it was but I'll say it anyway.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry if you everything.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do you know I would do anything for you?

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Did you stay too long?

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not sorry anymore.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
For the way I was before.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And as far as I can turn I think we fell.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We fell.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not sorry anymore.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There's a change you can't think more.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's a lesson to be learned.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I simply fell.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm not about to go down by myself.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm not about to go down by myself.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm not about to go down by someone else.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm not about to go down by myself.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm not about to go down by myself.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm not about to go down by taking you with me.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Make blacks have been straight up.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm not sorry.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
From the positive music network.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Man, I've been getting a lot of, I'm sorry.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm not sorry.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And as far as I've considered, I'd say we barely, we barely, I'm not sorry anymore, there's a change you can't ignore, there's a lesson to be learned, I'd say we barely, I'm sorry about that, Nick Black, yeah, a lot of people talking about Nick Blacks, ending in comments and links on the PodsA Music Network, if you want to find out more about Mr. Black, Nick Black, head on over to dailysourcecode.com.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Hey, everybody, how are you doing? It's a show number five, five, six, the chat chat, the Charlie on and full effect. If you are looking at your iPod or your iTunes or some other player or the PodsAoMashboarding, you see the picture of the fine cat, let me just explain that.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Remember I built those pipes, the Yahoo pipes, the new pipes thing they've got, pipes.yahoo.com, and I said, okay, take the daily source code feed and the show notes, run it through Yahoo's special engine that is supposed to understand the context of each individual entry, so each show and then give me some pictures that from flicker using tags or whatever.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So it's all kind of like the secret Yahoo mumbo jumbo secret sauce and this picture showed up with this cat literally like flying through the air and every single time I look, I'm just like, yeah, that's awesome.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hey, shows a little bit later than the normal, of course, there was no show on Friday due to travel. I've got to say in a real English way, I'm knackered.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh man, got home Friday. We landed on time. We actually landed a little bit ahead of schedule and of course, what always happens that he throw in the early morning is, you know, someone's supposed to leave the stand or the jet way or the gate or whatever and so they're there and then we're waiting and then we pull up.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We'd like an hour and a half on the ground or really sucked. So I got home a little bit later than anticipated and I was just like, I'd already told P to up for the for serious. I said, oh, man, you, you better get a backup show because I don't think we're going to be able to make it.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And, and I didn't, honestly. And, and of course, I had to come back in time and in time to turn around because we had our our social event last Saturday night, the lady Patricia and I were invited to Gavin Patterson's house is a wife and his four kids in,

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:22,000
what is that, a small town outside of London, Sheperton. And it was a big deal, you know, this is the first social event we've been invited to. Now, Gavin is he's big man on campus at BT. So it was interesting, you know, someone who I met professionally and now is going to socialize with and we don't know anybody here, you know, no one invites us to anything, certainly not like young hit people. And of course, Gavin is wife for younger than we are.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But it was awesome, man. I would two other couples there. And yeah, I felt like we were being pulled into a social circle. And I don't know, is it something in the water over at BT? Do you recall when I met with the CEO been providing known as the flying Dutchman that the first thing he wanted to do with search for food podcasts?

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Because he's really into cooking. Well, check this. So Gavin cooked the meal and dude, it was like, it was really, really good. And it was good wine and that good conversation.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,000
See, one of the other couples or two other couples there. He was he's a songwriter and producer. I think he's done a couple of West life songs.

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Steve is his name. Steve McKenzie, I think Steve Mack is how Steve. And so that was fun. You know, we chatted him. Of course, we did we looked at the lunar eclipse.

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I hope you saw the lunar eclipse. It was spectacular from from London. It really was nice. We stood out there with binoculars and, you know, just kind of marveled.

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I think really how, you know, when you look at the moon through a telescope or binoculars, particularly a full moon as it was.

85
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You know, it's really bright and it's, you just can't really see all the definition of the planet itself. But now with this eclipse, it was like a, like a ruby red.

86
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah, like a light ruby red. And it was very easy to look at it.

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And it was a freak of nature, but I loved it. Sunday I wanted to go to, well, the aircraft, the Delta Sierra has has his annual coming up in March this month, obviously.

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
In case you're interested in aviation, every aircraft needs to have an annual inspection. And that happens obviously once a year.

89
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The timing is quite good because, you know, it's still kind of shitty weather and not a lot of opportunity to fly.

90
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But yet it is flyable to do the, you know, to get it to where it has to be for the, for the annual inspection. And, you know, that the engine,

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
they open up the engine, they, you know, they drain all the fluids, putting fluids in, they're going to check the wheels, you know, the whole thing, right.

92
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But Sunday was, gosh, it was, it was a nightmare, the weather. It was, it was, it was, it was gusting up to 40 knots of wind.

93
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So we didn't, didn't go anywhere, but I knew that this morning I had to get up at the crack of dawn. It was actually quite dark because I had committed to speaking,

94
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
actually talking with a group of marketers at BT at British Telecom. And I've never really done an early meeting.

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We had to be somewhere like at 830 a.m. in London. So I got up at 6. I said crack of dawn.

96
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I have to door by 7. 717, I call it the train. And I learned something very important because I love taking the, you know, the first class cabin because it's just nice.

97
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I think it has better suspension. They have power there for your laptop, you know, it's, it's, it feels nice.

98
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And I, a little did I know that doesn't, doesn't matter what kind of ticket you bought.

99
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
There's no place to sit on the 717, I am drained. There's people sitting in the aisles.

100
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It was really, and, and this is kind of like a fast train. So it doesn't make a lot of stops.

101
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It came up from, uh, portsmith maybe, portsmith, uh, somewhere down south.

102
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And people were just fast asleep. They must have gotten on this train at 5 o'clock in the morning. Oh, my goodness.

103
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So I learned an important lesson there. So I had a nice, nice morning and to wrap it all up.

104
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's why the show's a little bit late because I came back home and decided to the show after I was done.

105
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But now I'm like, ah, tired. Um, okay. Lots of stuff to talk about.

106
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I did do some fidgeting and fooling around with the N800 over the weekend. I just got the, the European Nav Kit in.

107
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Uh, that's my personal Nav Kit. So, um, I'm just going to, uh, I got to reconfigure some files and stuff.

108
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And then I can set up the N800, which will go on board Trinity on her tour.

109
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Um, and open her ports wide up. Uh, you know, we've, uh, we've been talking about a name since Trinity has, as Trinity is a car.

110
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And she has her name. We have to give this, uh, this device that the developers are going to enter.

111
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Violate her, her file system by entering her ports. We have to give her a name.

112
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Now, lots of different names that we got. Sharon Stone was a name, so call her Sharon because Sharon has also displayed her ports.

113
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I like the suggestion, but when you say Sharon, I think of Sharon Osborne and there's nothing sexy about Sharon Osborne in my opinion.

114
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Uh, I'm thinking why not just call it Angelina, because that truly is the dark mistress of ports.

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Hi Adam, this is early from the dark compass pod cast and what sort of the first one came through. I'm not so I'm doing it a second time.

116
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Just so that you know that I was listening to where daily source code 555 and um, you were discussing about multiple sclerosis and we should have had this disease by the boss by now.

117
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And yes, I believe from Tonshikku, um, I was diagnosed with MS over a year ago now, and it's taking me a long time to become emotionally repaired from, um, coming to terms with the ailment.

118
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'd say that it's, it's not, um, caused lots of trouble in my life, but, um, second me a long time to come to terms with it all.

119
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Anyway, um, there was a thing in the paper about it, um, saying that MS can be brought on by lack of vitamin D, which is sort of some sign and things like that.

120
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So as dusty geeks in dark corners using laptops and desktop and things like that, might be at a higher risk. I don't know, I really take those kind of things with a pinch of salt.

121
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But anyway, just for their blood, you know.

122
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Um, thanks a lot, Adam, take it. Yeah. So unfortunately, no earth shattering news about a cure.

123
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This stems from the, uh, the, uh, the bitties walk promo that I played on Thursday. Yeah, what was I think Thursday? Oh, maybe it was one last week, whatever.

124
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm and Monica with the band. Now if you've never seen the bitties, I'll put a link in the show notes to their site. They're all cute.

125
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay. And so, and, and not only that, but their fantastic musicians.

126
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And what they did last year with the bitty walk, which is a part of the walk, uh, the MS walk.

127
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
They raised, uh, I think was close to $30,000. And it was, as far as I know, was done through podcasts, uh,

128
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
no CC Chapman helped out a lot on that, uh, and through, uh, through websites and web logs.

129
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And I kind of, I got carried away. And then, uh, and, you know, after the promo, I said that I had had several erotic dreams about a mandamonico,

130
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
uh, who actually does the spot and that, oh, luckily she called in to say hi.

131
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Adam clearly, this is a mandamonico.

132
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Uh, um, I was very, very enthusiastic of you.

133
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Um, the podcast today. Um, but whatever, uh, thank you so much for, um, for posting the, uh,

134
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
not posting for playing our, our promo. Um, and, uh, we should good walk with us.

135
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That would be fun. Um, and I hope you're well.

136
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Talk to you soon. Bye.

137
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What do you mean whatever a mandamonico? That's, let me know whatever.

138
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
When I'm having erotic dreams of you, this is kind of what springs to mind.

139
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Ah man, this brings back memories.

140
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Thank you at Tom Schuiting for finding this and editing it and putting it together.

141
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm going to keep this one on standby because I think we're going to be needing this from time to time on the daily source code.

142
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hey Adam, Gary Alexander here from the ultimate podcast.

143
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I bet you're wondering why I'm whispering.

144
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's because my shows about to blow up.

145
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I just sound with pod show bitches.

146
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm not bragging and I'm not boasting.

147
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's called the ultimate podcast for a reason.

148
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's because it's about the ultimate fighting championship.

149
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The UFC makes martial arts is the fastest growing sport in the world.

150
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I go behind the scenes with these fighters.

151
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I take you into the gym with these fighters.

152
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I let you know who these fighters are when the gloves are off.

153
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's not that big of a deal on my show to hear this.

154
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I want to win the fight however I have to.

155
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It comes down to cutting his face.

156
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So be it.

157
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Or to hear what light heavyweight champion of the world.

158
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Chuck Ladell listen to on his iPod.

159
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Before a fight, I have everything country.

160
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I listen to they laugh.

161
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I listen to country.

162
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I listen to rap.

163
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It popped.

164
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Change from one to the next.

165
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I've got country to slayer than to rap.

166
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So for your weekly dose of testosterone, come on over to the ultimate.podshow.com.

167
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Wow.

168
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
All right.

169
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I think this was, um, I think what didn't he send in a comment or something.

170
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And then I said, I really like the idea of a show about about ultimate fighting.

171
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And then, you know, the ball just rolled and there you go.

172
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Now on the network.

173
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Fantastic.

174
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
People send me emails all the time and say, you know, how do I join the pod show network?

175
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's really easy.

176
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You know, you just say, head like the join.

177
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's not all that hard.

178
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And you can join, you can join the network whenever you want.

179
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And use all the services.

180
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But, you know, when we really go for the marketing, the PR angle.

181
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And of course, uh, advertising and sponsorships.

182
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I just send me an email, send someone an email.

183
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think there's a link on the site where you can send an email.

184
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
At what are the requirements?

185
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
All you got to want to do is build an audience.

186
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's all I think anyone cares about.

187
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Whatever your audience is.

188
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Open for business.

189
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Hey, Adam.

190
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's Steve Werner from Fitbitations.

191
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The weekly podcast for runners at Steve Werner.com.

192
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm out here listening to the Charlie on a 10 mile training run

193
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Through the backcountry roads of New England.

194
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You might remember that last year, I ran the 110th Boston marathon.

195
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The oldest and most prestigious annual 26.2 mile road race on earth.

196
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And this year, on April 16th, I'm going to do it all over again.

197
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
On race day, I'll be wearing a computer chip on one of my running shoes.

198
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So podcast listeners can track my progress in real time as I run from Hopkins

199
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and Massachusetts to downtown Boston.

200
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'll have details on how to do that at Steve Werner.com.

201
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
My show may be just a goofy little podcast.

202
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And I've only been producing it since the summer of 05.

203
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But technically speaking at least, I guess you can say that

204
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Fitbitations is the longest running podcast in the podcast universe.

205
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And on April 16th, I'll be podcasting as I run the Boston marathon.

206
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Again, you can find out more at Steve Werner.com.

207
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Thanks again, Adam.

208
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Got a run.

209
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Hi, Steve.

210
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
For Dipbitations.

211
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Awesome, dude.

212
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah, that was pretty cool last year.

213
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
With that chip that he has an issue and you can just follow.

214
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's very reminiscent of a free Trinity project.

215
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Maybe we should just have Steve run across the country.

216
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's an idea.

217
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Running from Wi-Fi spot to Wi-Fi hotspot.

218
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh, man, I almost forgot to tell you.

219
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So I got the navigation kit with the US maps for the N800.

220
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And it comes with a little Bluetooth receiver.

221
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This is the web tablet that I've been using that I'm just rating about because I love it so much.

222
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
By the way, this is not paid endorsement.

223
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
No money has exchange hands with Nokia.

224
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So it comes with a little Bluetooth receiver, which is really good.

225
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Because I've had a couple of these Bluetooth GPS receivers and it takes a long time from to lock in.

226
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And this thing is like boom, it locked into the satellite.

227
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's very quickly seems to have a fantastic reception.

228
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Because normally I have to stick it against the window of the car or something like that.

229
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And he had just had it in my pocket and was working.

230
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And so I decided to be very naughty and bad.

231
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And even though you're not supposed to have any devices that transmit on during the flight,

232
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I placed the little receiver right near the window in my version Atlantic upper class suite.

233
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I had to kind of balance it there with a pillow up against the window.

234
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And so I followed along.

235
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
How much of a geek am I?

236
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So I followed along on the map.

237
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And San Francisco airport SFO was clearly marked.

238
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But even nicer, all four runways are also on the map.

239
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So, excuse me.

240
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's getting better.

241
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So I could actually see as we were parallel the runway to turn around and then head off into the wind and take off.

242
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And I was literally watching the runway on my screen.

243
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It was really an awesome experience.

244
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And I could see the speed.

245
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You know, it's sure enough about 170 miles an hour.

246
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We rotate and we take off.

247
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And as we're flying of north, the map actually stayed down relatively low because of course

248
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's meant for driving.

249
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So it knew my position.

250
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You know, it could calculate a position quite easily.

251
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But of course, what it was showing me was the position that I was at had I been on the ground.

252
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And it was the most awesome thing to just see the landscape and the roads and the towns at 500 miles an hour going.

253
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah, and I had turned on a couple of point of interest.

254
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You know, you can turn, they have like all the Wi-Fi hotspot.

255
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That really slowed down the performance.

256
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But petrol stations, gas stations.

257
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It was really, it was a trip.

258
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It really was like, wow, this is, this is how I'm going right now.

259
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
If I were on the road, look at this, look at this line.

260
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Look at what I'm crossing.

261
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'd certainly recommend that to anyone who wants to break the rules.

262
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Hello, Adam.

263
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So Mike Turner here from Bristol in the United Kingdom.

264
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
About pop fading and a couple of you podcasts that you know about.

265
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Perversion for profits, whatever happened to that.

266
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You know, last year's your video podcast.

267
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
These are like that one.

268
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You know what?

269
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's too much work.

270
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It really is.

271
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a lot of work transcoding all this stuff.

272
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's why I'm, I've been playing around with cast blaster mics.

273
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Vig caster because that'll basically take any video you throw at it.

274
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And then you can compile stuff together and then.

275
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Done, you know, it renders out a whole show.

276
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So I think that I would probably once that really starts working well.

277
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Forming is a couple of things I need.

278
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I want to be able to do voiceovers over the video.

279
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And that's not, I don't know if that ever be possible.

280
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But it's not possible currently.

281
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Then I'll bring it back.

282
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But it's just, it's a lot of work.

283
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And most of the work, by the way, is done and.

284
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Excuse me, folders with splendid.

285
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's, uh, most of the, most of the work is in converting all these different.

286
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Formats, you know, back and forth.

287
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's, it's really.

288
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's not easy.

289
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's just using MP3's.

290
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
A bit money on that production equipment for as well.

291
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And also your daughter, daughter's one.

292
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Christina's, uh, pod saves the queen.

293
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
He's like that one as well.

294
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Great podcast.

295
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Um, just get the.

296
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Anyway, I can be found at, uh,

297
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The game I'm show.

298
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Don't think you pot show dot com.

299
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Cheers.

300
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Cheers.

301
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, interesting.

302
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You should say that because, um, you know, now with the new, with the BFF, the boyfriend.

303
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Um, Andy.

304
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah, he's, he's said to Chris.

305
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Because I think it was just, once she gets doing it, she likes it.

306
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But, you know, she's kind of just a lazy.

307
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Like a teenager.

308
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It doesn't really want to get started on it.

309
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Uh, but Andrew's, Andy's very interested.

310
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And he wants to engineer it.

311
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And yeah, he knows how to run sound boards.

312
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Uh, sound board and stuff.

313
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
He's a musician.

314
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Uh, so, um, Christina announced to me the day before I came home.

315
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah, Thursday, when we, when we spoke, she had a really good grade for one of her, uh,

316
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
one of her important, uh, essays or whatever, uh, for English.

317
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And we talked about that.

318
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
She's, oh, you know, Andy and I are going to do a show.

319
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So I guess it's coming back.

320
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Uh, but I, I just don't want to push, you know, if she, if she wants to do it,

321
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
fine, if she doesn't, you know, what am I going to say?

322
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
She's a teenager.

323
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
She did get a part time job.

324
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Another thing Andy can't stand.

325
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
He's like, you know, if you just do a couple of podcasts, then you would make more money.

326
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Then you make an entire week at this job.

327
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
She's at, uh, one of those, uh, boutiques, uh, in the high street.

328
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And, you know, she's cleaning, you know, tidy up clothing racks and helping customers.

329
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And, uh, but you know, she went out.

330
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
She got the job herself.

331
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And I think that's important.

332
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It was a big, big part of why she wanted to do it.

333
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I think.

334
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And she's really proud of it.

335
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So, but anyway, to come back to your question,

336
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I think part save the queen is in the cards.

337
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I got to squeeze this one in before the saddle I window and hold on.

338
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Hi Adam Simon here from SLAM Idol.

339
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I just wanted to let you and your listeners know,

340
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
just how proud I am that the SLAM Idol podcast is now a part of the pod show family.

341
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
As you know, SLAM Idol is all about spoken word performance.

342
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
On the SLAM Idol podcast, you can hear some of the best performance poets from around the world,

343
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
battling for the title of SLAM Idol.

344
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The contest are conducted in audio or video format.

345
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And the winner in each contest is decided by the votes cast by the listeners.

346
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
In the current contest, we've got all six poets publishing audio blogs,

347
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
while they're writing their poems to a deadline,

348
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
which is providing a real fascinating insight into the writing process

349
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and is proving to be amazingly interactive as well.

350
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And I've got a few more ideas up my sleeve to take SLAM Idol into new and innovative areas.

351
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And I really think that being part of pod show family

352
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
will play a big part in making those happen.

353
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Thanks again for your support Adam and the website is at SLAM Idol.cast.com.

354
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Right, huh?

355
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I've been wanting to play that for a couple of shows now,

356
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
but I had to fit it into the satellite window because it's so much cooler when you

357
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
join the network and get stuff going and it's also played on serious.

358
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I know people like that, so I really try.

359
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You know, as we were growing as a company,

360
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
there's a lot of things you start to look at.

361
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Cost of communications is one.

362
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We have like a corporate department now with HR and shit.

363
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I've been through this before.

364
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So you start to look at, you know,

365
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
we have multiple offices in different countries.

366
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You start to look at, you know, getting a common,

367
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
well, I think we have a common cell phone plan,

368
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
but you even start to evaluate that.

369
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And, you know, my phone calls are pretty expensive.

370
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Now, the reason why, of course, is because I continue to use my U.S.

371
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
phone even in the UK.

372
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And that's really just for convenience sake,

373
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
because short of carrying two phones with me the whole time,

374
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
which is, which will be an incredible pain in the ass,

375
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
which so I could have a UK number.

376
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I just carry that one around.

377
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So of course, anything any calls I make or receive here

378
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
are subject to roaming charges,

379
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
which can really, can really add up.

380
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So I know that we're looking at a voiceover IP solution

381
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
between our offices,

382
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and it would make sense for me to have that here at home as well.

383
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So, and I was just looking around and I'm like, you know,

384
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
what is available?

385
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And I know that the E61, the Nokia E61 phone that I have,

386
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
that it will do voiceover IP,

387
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and it will use the same address book.

388
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
These are all the things you run into.

389
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I mean, yes, easy enough to set up, you know,

390
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
or use Skype or whatever.

391
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But there's a lot when it comes to, you know,

392
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
coordinating, particularly your phone numbers,

393
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and also very, very minor things that are incredibly irritating

394
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
if they don't work, like caller ID, you know,

395
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
it's like, I know who's calling me,

396
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
nine times out of ten, because the only people who call me

397
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
are the ones that are probably in my phone book anyway.

398
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And so I can see who it is, you know, it just helps.

399
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It just makes me feel better knowing.

400
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I can already set my mind to what the conversation is about to be.

401
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
A lot of that doesn't work with voice systems.

402
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You know, and it's all just because it's catching up,

403
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and not all the protocols have been implemented.

404
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But I've been playing with two different systems,

405
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
which I thought were pretty cool.

406
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I just wanted to mention one is,

407
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and you really should check this out.

408
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It works on, I think all Nokia phones is called

409
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Fring,

410
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Fox Trot, Romeo, India, November, Golf,

411
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
so F-ring, Fring,

412
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and you loaded up.

413
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And hello.

414
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I thought that was a lady Patricia.

415
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So you loaded it up on your phone.

416
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It actually will not import,

417
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
but it will integrate your existing Nokia phone book,

418
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
which is nice.

419
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And with it, you can do voiceover IP chats, of course,

420
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and that's nothing new.

421
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But you can also do calls on G-talk.

422
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You can do voice calls on MSN.

423
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And Skype.

424
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Interestingly enough.

425
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So I guess those guys have some kind of server set up,

426
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and this piece of software talks that server.

427
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm not going to share how it works, actually.

428
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It doesn't matter.

429
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
But you can happily use Skype out, Skype in works.

430
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And the application is still a little bit buggy.

431
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You have to flash my phone and get the latest firmware

432
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
to make sure.

433
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But it works.

434
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And so if you're in the neighborhood of a Wi-Fi connection,

435
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
then you can receive calls and make calls.

436
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Of course, not the same number.

437
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Lots of drawbacks.

438
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But I was really blown away by this thing called the Gizmo project.

439
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And there's a client for this for virtually every platform.

440
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Windows, Mac, Linux, and also one for the N800.

441
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And I really like this service.

442
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I mean, it's thinking a lot like I am.

443
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It lets you integrate your contacts from your Windows address book,

444
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
or your Outlook, your Outlook Express.

445
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So that's pretty good.

446
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So you can kind of synchronize those up.

447
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But I like about it.

448
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It uses a little bit more bandwidth.

449
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And it gives you a fantastic quality of call.

450
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It really does.

451
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And I have to say it's it's it's changed my N800 into a into a phone.

452
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It really has.

453
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And so this week is going to be the first week that I'm really going to test it in conference calls.

454
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Because a lot of times when the quality degrades and it does happen.

455
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And then it's just not worth it.

456
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You know, just you're wishing for a regular cell phone call.

457
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But I think this is something interesting and something.

458
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I mean, the quality is really good.

459
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You know, Skype is it works.

460
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And you kind of feel like you're getting what you pay for.

461
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But this has the same dial in dial out rates.

462
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And it just feels like it's a lot like it feels like the service has a lot more sound.

463
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Like it's less buggy.

464
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And the quality is better.

465
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And it's probably because it uses more bandwidth.

466
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
But I'll put a link in the show notes of that.

467
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
If you're looking into voice over IP solutions.

468
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm sure someone's going to send in some kind of idea or comment.

469
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But just one of those things.

470
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm just, you know, I got interested in it now.

471
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Now I saw the $3,000 on phone bill.

472
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Adam, it's James from Durham.

473
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Not London, but Durham.

474
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Or piano, or the Stav England.

475
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Land of the Principuships.

476
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Yes.

477
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
A couple of weeks back, you've got a voice mail.

478
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I think it was from Digital Planets, the BBC podcast.

479
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm sure it was.

480
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
If that's not the case, then stop this common straightaway because it's not valid.

481
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But if that is the case, I was listening to Digital Planets.

482
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
In the digital planet a couple of days ago on the latest episode.

483
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And there's a bit of a clue as to whether these people actually do listen to the DSC or not.

484
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
See what you think.

485
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
We've had more technology now, built to help us do it.

486
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Well, it's just so easy.

487
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I mean, you can't stop people publishing online.

488
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And that's one of the great things about the last sort of seven or eight years of the growth of the internet.

489
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm sure it's sort of Peter and Chris will both agree that there's just explosion in.

490
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
People being able to get their voices out there to be heard.

491
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's fantastic.

492
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It is magnificent.

493
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah, I mean, Peter, you don't need no stinking transmitters.

494
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And you're saying before we actually started putting this program together, that you create podcasts using.

495
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So there you go.

496
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I don't know if it's worth ringing these people to me.

497
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It actually would be genuine and maybe want to do an interview.

498
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But you may already be there anyway.

499
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But there you go.

500
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And I hope you enjoy the improved audio quality.

501
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Yes.

502
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
James, much better.

503
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
James calls in like five times a day.

504
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And usually as cell phones drop an hour and there.

505
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Much better James.

506
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Well, the guy did ask me to come on that show.

507
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
But I was in San Francisco at the time.

508
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We had eight hour time difference.

509
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I'd have to get up in the middle of the night.

510
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And it was like, so I just didn't work out.

511
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But yeah, I think I think he's the host certainly was listening.

512
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
This no stink in transmitters.

513
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, like that.

514
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Um, just to make it shorter short for today.

515
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
A couple of comments about about Wi-Fi.

516
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Check this.

517
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
This is, this is a good.

518
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah, it's stuck in.

519
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You got it.

520
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I guess.

521
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I did it in the $500 pickup truck rolling down.

522
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yeah.

523
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Who?

524
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
What is this?

525
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Route 7 in Virginia.

526
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Listening to the wireless on touch on number five, five, five.

527
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And the wireless discussion about putting the email address as the SSID,

528
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
which is a great idea.

529
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I think I agree with you about, you know, putting in the software that opens the web page

530
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and makes it look like a hotel or airport access.

531
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Yeah, that would be extra geeky, although that appeals to me as well.

532
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
But I seem to recall, back in the old days of wireless and maybe still.

533
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Um, people in cities, especially like New York, we've put their router right in the window

534
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
of like their apartment.

535
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And then down on the sidewalk with chalk, I guess.

536
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
We'd leave a symbol and I forget now what the symbol was, where there was some sort of symbol

537
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
that you could chalk onto the sidewalk.

538
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So that passers by would know that there was an open wireless exit.

539
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Access point there.

540
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And, um, you know, so you could sit down on the park bench nearby and and get online.

541
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Now, now a lot of municipalities, specifically like here in Alexandria, Virginia,

542
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
our friends at Earthlink are opening up a Wi-Fi network, which is now in downtown,

543
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
but they're going to expand it all over town.

544
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Some of the other communities around here are planning on doing that.

545
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I know Philadelphia is planning on doing it.

546
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Much to the secret of some of the other internet providers that don't want them to.

547
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But what a great idea if you want, if you want your, if you are going to have your access point open,

548
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
you know, put some little symbol out in the world.

549
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So that passers by will know that they can get online there.

550
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
That's it.

551
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Jack.

552
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Jack podcast.com.

553
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
On Jack, Jack.

554
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah, there he goes.

555
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
What was that called chalking war chalking something like that?

556
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I remember that very well.

557
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And I have to say it was kind of before GPS really kicked in.

558
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And that's what those, I was talking about those Wi-Fi points of interest.

559
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm not quite sure where the, what database, where that data is coming from,

560
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
but obviously the, you know, the 2007 version of war chalking is to get your Wi-Fi access point,

561
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
listed in one of these GPS database systems so that, you know,

562
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
people can use a GPS receiver to actually go from point to point.

563
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
But I think, you know, looking a little bit further.

564
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm a big believer in keeping your computer on 24 hours a day, not rebooting it,

565
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
turning it off.

566
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And I'm also in believer that we're going to have just wireless access everywhere.

567
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I ensure right now there's different versions of it.

568
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But, you know, I can get my email on my cell phone.

569
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I can get, uh, I can get if I want to even get MP3s.

570
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
There was slow link, you know, there's something in London I think now called the cloud.

571
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I don't know too much about it, but from what I understand,

572
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
it's a wireless network that is supposed to cover portions of London.

573
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
If not all of it, I really don't really don't know.

574
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And instead of, um, using a, um, a password like regular web encryption,

575
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
it uses your MAC address so that is the physical, um,

576
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
computer address of your Ethernet adapter in this case, your Wi-Fi card.

577
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Um, and so wherever you go, it's continuously, you know, kind of roaming and

578
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
giving you a blanketed coverage.

579
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I mean, that's, that's where it's got to go.

580
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And, and, you know, the bandwidth will go up.

581
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
No doubt about it.

582
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You know, one way or the other is going to go up.

583
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And, and you'll be able to get whatever you want wherever you want.

584
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So, this is just interim stuff.

585
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
In the meantime, as I've said,

586
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
you're free to suck off my Wi-Fi.

587
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Anytime you want, you know, it's open.

588
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You don't even need to email me.

589
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Suck at will.

590
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And I think James came back with another brilliant thought about this idea of putting your email address

591
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
as your, uh, Wi-Fi access name so that people could then email you and, you know, say,

592
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
hey, can I have some access?

593
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That James is always thinking on his feet.

594
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Hi Adam, it's Kevin Cross from the frapp.

595
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Crap.

596
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's Kevin.

597
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Not James.

598
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's podcast.

599
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Uh, with your discussion about James's idea of using an email address and you are, uh,

600
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Wi-Fi network name.

601
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Uh, so let me get this straight.

602
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm trying to filter some of these free Wi-Fi because I don't have internet access.

603
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And I see the email address so I email them to get access.

604
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But wait, I don't have internet access.

605
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
How do you email somebody if you don't have internet access?

606
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Seems like a flaw on the plan.

607
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I got, uh, idea of getting the web page,

608
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
or you can just type in something or whatever.

609
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Anyway, um, just to thought maybe I'm missing something

610
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
not to be a touchy later.

611
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
It's a perfect great work.

612
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Now, you're, uh, I think you're absolutely right.

613
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?

614
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I don't have access to how am I going to email him.

615
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Mm-hmm.

616
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Ah, back to the drawing board on that one, then.

617
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
This is a nice endorsement, uh, Richard Jeffrey says,

618
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Hey, Adam wanted to write and give you a comment on the DSC show where you talked about in the attic.

619
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
This is the show with the Rachel Fuller and her boyfriend, Pete Townsend.

620
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
After watching all 12 shows so far, I went to iTunes,

621
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
bought a shitload of music from the artist they had on a work for a band of sound engineer.

622
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
We would sit around and play acoustic guitars and those with the best moments,

623
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
which is exactly what in the attic is.

624
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Podcasting my opinion seems to be more personal easier to get the content.

625
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And that hits home with a listener at the point is I've bought and experienced more music

626
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
because of shows like yours and not from the radio.

627
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Also, I've not listened to regular radio since I got my iPod.

628
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I hope to have my own podcast up this weekend.

629
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Richard, awesome dude.

630
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yeah.

631
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And this is good because later in the week I want to talk about, uh,

632
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I want to talk a little bit more about money and about advertising.

633
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Because we haven't talked about that in a long time.

634
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And, uh, I feel, I feel the need.

635
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It's time once again.

636
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Like this.

637
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Sorry.

638
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
My ears hurt as much as yours do now though.

639
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Don't worry.

640
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It's pretty good promo.

641
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Good morning, good evening, good day to you.

642
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You're listening to Young Potset Band.

643
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Best in New Electronics music coming to you live from London Bridge, England.

644
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So welcome to the Young Potset Band.

645
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Let's do that by music and nature.

646
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
London Bridge, England.

647
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
We will be bringing you best in your electronic sounds coming out of the UK

648
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
or anywhere else where we find something interesting.

649
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
There'll be house music.

650
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
There'll be breaks.

651
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
There'll be drum and bass.

652
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yeah.

653
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
There'll be a let-tropop.

654
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So maybe the sounds of a durable running along a synthesizer.

655
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Subliminal message.

656
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
www.theunpunks.com

657
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Punks is spelled P-U-N-X.

658
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Because of course, in Sakura and they're spelled with X's and Z's.

659
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And when FF is spelled with a PH instead of an F.

660
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Alright, the Young Punks have an awesome.

661
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Friday, of course, I missed the show.

662
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Which means, and that's tough, I know.

663
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I think a lot of people miss the food barness.

664
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But I was literally food barred, okay?

665
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So, so give me a break.

666
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But of course, you know, there's a lot of love

667
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and work that always goes into a food bar Friday,

668
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
including work from our own music colleges,

669
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
surgesy Todd.

670
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So let's just pretend he's talking about Monday, okay?

671
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Hey, how's it going, AC?

672
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Happy food bar Friday.

673
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Hey, listen, I've got a really, really interesting band for you this week.

674
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
The band's name is Army of Me at New York.

675
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
They just came out with a new EP released on doghouse records back in November.

676
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And they posted two amazing songs on the Podsafe music network.

677
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
If that's not enough, if you go over to their MySpace page,

678
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
the song that I'm going to play for you going through changes

679
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
has been downloaded over a hundred thousand times.

680
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Check this out.

681
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The song is going through changes by Army of Me.

682
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
On, food bar Friday.

683
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah, you're going to like this, I know it.

684
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's hard to ask strength when there's nothing to eat.

685
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And it's hard to eat when you don't have the teeth.

686
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And how am you losing the one thing you love?

687
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
There's nothing below and there's nothing above.

688
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Well, I've been going through changes by Friends.

689
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Going through changes by Friends.

690
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Going through changes by Friends.

691
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:28,000
We're nothing at all.

692
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Let's hard to accept what you don't understand.

693
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And it's hard to launch without knowing how to land.

694
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And how it burns, you can't change a thing.

695
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Oh, you can soften the blow.

696
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
But you can't stop this thing.

697
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And I've been going through changes by Friends.

698
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Going through changes by Friends.

699
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Going through changes by Friends.

700
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
We're nothing at all.

701
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Nothing at all.

702
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:36,000
We're nothing at all.

703
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I'm still yours, even if you're not mine.

704
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I stare at the floor and I study the lines.

705
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
But what took my place in the back of the crowd?

706
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Baby, I couldn't see it, but at least it was loud.

707
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
At least it was loud.

708
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And I've been going through changes by Friends.

709
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Going through changes by Friends.

710
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Going through changes by Friends.

711
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Going through changes by Friends.

712
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Going through changes by Friends.

713
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Going through changes by Friends.

714
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Going through changes by Friends.

715
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Now, you see, I couldn't just save that front of the week.

716
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Now, could I?

717
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Army of me.

718
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Thank you very much, sir.

719
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Jersey Todd.

720
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
The official musicologist of the Daily Source Code.

721
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Once again, doing your profession proud, sir.

722
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Today, yeah, man, it's still even longer than I expected.

723
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Tomorrow, a whole new show.

724
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Thank you very much for bearing with me.

725
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
The ramblings of the Middle Ages white guy.

726
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
DailySourceCode.com is where you can find the show notes.

727
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000

730
