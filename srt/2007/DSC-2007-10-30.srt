5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A stupid fucking mistake is ruining the whole fucking day.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's the onion radio news. This is Doyle Redland reporting.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Local man Matt Harbert can't believe his shitty fucking luck today.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
After missing the goddamn express bus, which has now ruined his entire fucking day.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Harbert says this shit hit the fan when he arrived ten minutes late.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Missing a major ass phone call that could end up costing him his goddamn fucking job.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm so fucked.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Gowork or Monica Weinberg, however, says Harbert just needs to relax.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's not the fucking end of the world.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Harbert now fears that his fucked up day could spill over into the evening and on into the foreseeable future,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
eventually fucking up the remainder of his sorry ass life.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Doyle Redland for the onion radio news.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Delta's year, Charlie six seven nine.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
$60 million worth of airplane strapped by ass.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
To the next generation radio content in my ears.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm podcasting his bedroom curry.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I've run the mountains.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's still the ice.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Release the fire.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's my problem way.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't take me down.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I saw the shadows.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh, David Godz.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Whispering answers.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's time for time.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
For him but true.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm frozen blue.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
There's not much time.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's not the fucking end of the world.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's not the fucking end.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We all betrayed you.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're not the world.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There's not much time

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:59,000
All right, why you're properly depressed now?

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well, it's a good shit, baby.

41
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Lilian Axe from the Pod Safety's Ignatwork and Artica Kickin' Off Episode

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Number 679 of the Daily Storms Code coming to you from the Apple and Suburb of Surrey,

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
known as Kilford on the west side of G-town.

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We're up in the attic, it's the Curry Manor.

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Your Daily Source Code is on.

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
In the world, we're women where comfortable shoes and technology has changed the way you get your entertainment.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is the Pod Show Network, no big media, no excuses, no BS.

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't know why I did that, I just felt like playing a jingle after I set off.

49
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Everybody, how you doing?

50
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Welcome to your show.

51
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's another beautiful day in Blighty.

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I've got the windows wide open.

53
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's almost like spring, but yet it reminds me very much of Autumn in New Jersey.

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And I can almost imagine going into New York,

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and it would be a little bit colder than it is, actually.

56
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Chestnuts starting to roast.

57
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hey, hey.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Is it almost time yet?

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We're not quite in November yet, are we?

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Because that's when we got officially started playing all the Christmas songs.

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You know how that works?

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Holiday tunes.

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh yeah.

65
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So thanks to PG Kelly for the opening one times there from the Onion Radio.

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's awesome.

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's a great way to start it off today.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Roll and ride into Lilian Axe.

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Because you know, I don't get a lot of, even though I'm online all day,

70
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and I'm connected, I really don't have a lot of time to go around surfing.

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This pastime that people have called Googling,

72
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
running around the internet and finding cool stuff,

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and it has become a pastime.

74
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Of course, I'm on the internet all day,

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and I have a social network, which is essentially email.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's still what it is to me.

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I've just not been able to win everybody that I work with off of email.

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's just, you know, I can see where Christina doesn't need email anymore.

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
She has one email address that she used to send me crap to print out for her for school work.

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Or I should say, or where I shouldn't say crap.

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But otherwise, it's all Facebook.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think she still does some my space.

83
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not quite sure.

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll have to get a ratio from her.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So my social network is of course email,

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and I get all kinds of stuff sent to me,

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and it's really great.

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But on the other hand, it's almost sometimes it's depressing.

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Anyway, an update on that story that we've been following about the fake FEMA press conference.

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Now, of course, for those of you who haven't followed along,

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency,

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
who are responsible for emergencies, such as Katrina,

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
while we know how that well they did on that.

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They're also responsible for managing the emergency in California.

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now, I believe the whole state is in a state of emergency.

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I think that's the official status.

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The FEMA, of course, responsible for helping,

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
can you put the fires out and managing the entire crisis.

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
They sent, they set up a press conference,

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
sent out word to the press core 15 minutes before it was bound to start,

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
which, of course, was a complete set up.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And since they were no actual members of the press,

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
as far as I know, none were in the press room,

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
they just had some FEMA people ask the questions.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And what was it, Pat Filbin?

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You just answered the questions.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So anyway, this, of course,

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
caused quite an outrage in an uproar.

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And so he's, he didn't get fired,

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
but he was scheduled to become director of public affairs for

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell.

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And that apparently is not happening.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Looks like he got set back for,

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
you know, it's what a bloody,

115
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
with the bloody cheek of this guy.

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
A FEMA in general to do this.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So anyways, I go from the FEMA story.

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I run into, you know, other things about this,

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
a company called Blackwater,

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
which you've probably heard about.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And I'm going to talk about that a bit today.

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm going to try and stay off of the Ron Paul trip.

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Although I got a call from Ron Paul's finance director.

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Probably.

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
They want my check.

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I told him November 5th is when I'm sending it.

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Remember, remember the fifth of November gunpowder trees

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and a plot.

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Send your money to RonPaul208.com

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and your country.

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You will not have forgotten.

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah.

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I made a rhyme on that.

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I have high shelves.

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I've a ceiling.

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I left you very drunk.

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Nice six shelves.

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh man.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Charles, did you ever?

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I wish I, maybe I saved it.

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You were so hammered dude.

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And it was just like this,

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
it was, it was funny,

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
but then it got unfunny because it just didn't stop.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And you were like really falling over yourself.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So I didn't play that one.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But yes, you did call Charles.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This is Charles, our drunkard London friend.

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I better known as Charles, the drunkard Londoner.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
My calls, messages.

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So I remember being on the phone.

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The morning after, the one who was I called.

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So yeah, I hoped what I said wasn't rude or whatever.

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But yeah, that was me being drunk Londoner.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm loving the dialogue you wrote me up about the US Constitution.

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It makes me think a little bit more about our own situation in this country.

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And how I really ought to educate myself a little bit more.

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm a 33-year-old man who, I don't even know how many counties are in England.

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I certainly couldn't name them.

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
When I really couldn't, which is EGAC.

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So when people talk about American ignorance, then they do.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
In their own ignorance.

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I think they really ought to be looking at themselves as they say.

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
When one's like, you just pointy forwards there are three pointing back at them or four maybe.

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So yeah, I don't want to end message with your latest sign off,

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
which I've only just tapped into because of in a way for a while.

167
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But what I will say is do our intellectuals.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Or do we see stuff?

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Let's see whether you've got any Swedish listeners and words.

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It can talk to my boy.

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I want it.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
There you go.

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Sounds like you gave me the blue version of the Elskady.

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So I handed off the, actually I sent the link to the Ron Paul interview.

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Daily source code 672 are a UK press agency.

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And evil Alan Kingston does this part of the assignment.

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And really interesting what he got back is,

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you know, what he did is, actually here's, I'll just read parts of his email.

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I put together a transcript of the saline quotes,

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
which I hope would interest the UK press.

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's not been successful in getting them to run with the story.

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Which, of course, is okay.

183
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You know, I thought it might be interesting.

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It might be good for the show.

185
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It might be good for Ron Paul.

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It might be good for the Constitution in general.

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It might be good for the English reading public to learn a little bit about what's going on.

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The reactions as Alan has been pretty lukewarm.

189
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The message from all the press I've been to that if and when,

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Dr. Ron becomes a serious presidential candidate.

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Then of course, they'll be interested in him.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But right now, they say, isn't too much interest to their UK reader since most are unaware of him.

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, that's a chicken in the egg.

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I've heard one.

195
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And do which, of course, I say, that's interesting.

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He got like a 35% rating in the, in the most recent Republican GOP presidential debate in Florida,

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
which was the highest of all of them.

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But okay, so marginalization, I think, is what they call it.

199
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And here's the interesting part.

200
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
A couple of newspapers made the point that he has consistently said things about the US maintaining an isolationist style worldwide,

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
which is not true.

202
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You can, you can equated to an isolationist style.

203
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But that's not the message.

204
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't think he's ever said that.

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
To go on, pulling all the troops home and ceasing to be the world's policeman.

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes, but why the reason why is was very interesting.

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's a very different reason though, any other candidate is using.

208
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The press said they consequently, the consequently,

209
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the consequently, Ron Paul said nothing new in hence newsworthy as far as they are concerned.

210
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You losers.

211
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, well, I tried.

212
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Here you go.

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So clearly the British press, much more interested in Madeline McCain.

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's that story.

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's what's the story now that the parents of this poor child use some of their.

216
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Madeline fund, which is donations from people to pay their mortgage.

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And so, okay, so what do you, what the fuck is going on with the press over here, man?

218
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You guys are obsessed with this fucking story.

219
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Patricia was telling me yesterday, she said, oh, it was so horrible.

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There was this, she did see some new story probably on BBC about hundreds of kids who were being kidnapped from poor countries.

221
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And then brought back to the UK, I think, is where they were being brought to.

222
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And being sold at easy adoptions.

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And I said, what do you mean?

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You're kind of like the Madonna thing.

225
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I think she actually did the official way, but okay.

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And, you know, she's like, oh, that's so horrible.

227
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And I say, yes.

228
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And how come that's lemon on the front page of the newspaper every day?

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You know, why is it all about one white child?

230
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Just the questions I asked myself.

231
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So, yeah, you know what, let's get into this,

232
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
what's going to this, these videos that I've been watching that have been sent to me through email.

233
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Right after this, this promo, which would get you off.

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Hi, this is Michelle from Whisper Pearls and Michibelle's Hollywood.

235
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
When I first conceived with the golden path of love,

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I imagined Shaharazad telling erotic stories to her lover,

237
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
to keep him aroused until the next time she met him.

238
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I hope you have the same experience when you listen.

239
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Golden path dot pot show dot com.

240
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
May it fulfill your every fantasy.

241
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's part of pot show press books dot pot show dot com.

242
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This is cool, man.

243
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We got so many great things to listen to.

244
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm going to San Francisco tomorrow.

245
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So I'm going to load up.

246
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I got a whole bunch of audio novels that I want to take with me and listen to on the plane.

247
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm going to load them into the end 800 since it has the best battery light of every any device I have.

248
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, holy moly, almost forgot to tell you the Mac.

249
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It came back to life, of course.

250
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I, um, I configured it.

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I've installed everything.

252
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I've got time machine, which is the automatic backup.

253
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's all working now.

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I've restarted it a million times to make sure that the, the dreaded OS X setup assistant

255
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
doesn't come back.

256
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I got to tell you, I am totally, totally loving it.

257
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The speed is, uh, you know, it's, it's really, it's what I wish Red Hat was, you know, 10 years ago when we were banging around on, you know, on, on cheap hardware with with Linux installed.

258
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And I don't know, man, I just had, it has it.

259
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It, uh, as I've said before, it takes all the boxes.

260
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Now, um, incorrectly, the guys in the Apple store said that the new boot camp in Leopard that you could run Windows and OS X side by side.

261
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And I said, are you sure?

262
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I thought you had to reboot and then, you know, you could use one of the other.

263
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
No, no, no, he was very certain that you could run both.

264
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And I'm pretty sure that he was confused because I had access it.

265
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I mean, I want to copy a parallels.

266
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So, uh, I'll pick that up when I'm in San Francisco.

267
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll have the guys at the office install.

268
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We have, you know, sight licenses and all that crap.

269
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So that'll be easy.

270
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You can probably do it that way.

271
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Um, but I don't even know if I'm going to use the Windows side of things.

272
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I mean, the only reason I really use Windows.

273
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh, my goodness, excuse me.

274
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh, I know what I'll do.

275
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Run Paul every time I burp.

276
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That'll help you.

277
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I use Casplastron Windows.

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Of course, that's pretty much what I, you know, the main reason I'm using Windows.

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And this, the new Mac Leopard, man, the way it finds Windows machines and, and mounts,

280
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
uh, other drives and shared folders is quite phenomenal.

281
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What a, what a beautiful interface.

282
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So happy with it.

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So, uh, I will of course install that so that I couldn't get Casplastro up and running.

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But, um, I also went out and I looked for, you know, there is some improvement in the, in the OS,

285
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
10 in the Apple Mac category of programs you can use to create podcasts.

286
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And, uh, one really, the one that I like the most, which, uh,

287
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
uh, now it's only half of what Casplastro does is called sound bite.

288
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And with sound bite, you can basically load up just tons and tons of buttons that you can fire off.

289
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Very much like what Casplastro does for Windows.

290
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Um, and, you know, there's some, you can set keys for shortcuts and there's all kinds of little,

291
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
little things that have improved.

292
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I've seen this program before over the past couple of years, but it's really improved quite a bit.

293
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Uh, and it really works, um, phenomenally well.

294
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And there's lots of nice interface customization you can do.

295
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Of course, it doesn't have the other side of what Casplastro has,

296
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
which is the recording part.

297
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Um, and Casplastro's pretty bulletproof because it's, uh,

298
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
even if your home machine crashes up until the point where you're recording,

299
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
it has written it to a temp file.

300
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So you can get temp.mp3 and it'll always work.

301
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And of course, that's been a big problem with, uh, with the Mac audio hijack pro.

302
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I know that, um, in the past, I'm not sure about now, but in the past,

303
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
if you, if it would crash, it would basically screw up your whole recording.

304
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So I'm looking for a good recorder.

305
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And I may even just try some experiments, see if I can get everything working

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and the show running the way I wanted to with, with only Mac apps.

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So I'll keep you posted on that.

308
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I probably try that out in San Francisco.

309
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Anyway, so the first link I got, uh,

310
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
but I wanted to talk to you about was from, uh,

311
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Poppy Moreno.

312
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And, uh, Poppy's, uh, and Poppy's emailed me in the past before,

313
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and the subject of the email, please watch this.

314
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You should have this woman on your show, and I'm like, oh, yes.

315
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But that's because she's just hot.

316
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
She freely is.

317
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
She looks a little bit like one of my cousins back when she was hot.

318
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And my cousin's still hot, I guess.

319
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Kind of.

320
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah.

321
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
We're all old now.

322
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So we get less hot.

323
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Uh, her name is Naomi Wolfe.

324
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And she's written a book called The End of America, which, um,

325
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm hoping to pick up while I'm state side.

326
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I was thinking of ordering a via Amazon, but I'm sure I can pick it up somewhere

327
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
by the bookstore.

328
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And it, well, the title kind of says it all.

329
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's a real uplifting title.

330
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The end of America.

331
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But, um, essentially, this, this video is a speech of hers.

332
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And it lasts about 45, actually 48 minutes.

333
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's quite long.

334
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And in this speech, she goes through the 10 things that every

335
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
desperate or dictator or fascist has done to shut down democracy and free society

336
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
in an effort to take over that country in the world.

337
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And she compares, of course, to Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, these,

338
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
these are the main guys.

339
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And she puts the Bush administration into that.

340
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And when she goes through all of these 10 different steps that have to be taken,

341
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
which often have the exact words, such as embedded journalists.

342
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Uh, this is something that, uh,

343
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Gubbles, um, pioneered for the Nazis, uh,

344
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
literally the word embedded journalists.

345
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Uh, what was another really good one?

346
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Um, sleeper cells, which was used by Stalin.

347
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And sleeper cells actually, when used in the context of when Stalin

348
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
invented this concept, was supposed to be, uh, us.

349
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You know, uh, like those crazy, uh, capitalist.

350
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And they were going to all of a sudden, you know, live amongst the Russians and,

351
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and dressed like the Russians in one day just pop up and we take over Russia

352
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
from the inside.

353
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Sound familiar?

354
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But the one that really caught my eye was about black water.

355
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And I've been hearing about black water often on it is a private security firm

356
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
that by now has over a billion dollar government contract

357
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
to provide, quote, security, uh, to,

358
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I guess it's diplomats in Iraq.

359
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Now, I'm not quite sure how many, how many of these rent army guys there are.

360
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I've heard people say 30,000 have heard others say 100,000.

361
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What was most interesting to me is that when Naomi Wolf compares black water

362
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
to, um, the Mussolini's black shirts, hitlers, brown shirts,

363
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
um, it sounds so much like TSA, like Homeland Security, uh,

364
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
a high-mont, by the way, the German version.

365
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Sounds so much like black water.

366
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And that apparently, and, and I've looked this up and it looks pretty true to me,

367
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
that, uh, a large number of black water rent a army guys,

368
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
rent a army guys, like green army guys, only rent a army guys.

369
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Uh, we're, um, deployed to protect,

370
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I think it was to protect the French corridor during Katrina.

371
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So now we have next two police forces and, et cetera, local levels.

372
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
We've got, uh, the army, and then we have this, this like independent army.

373
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And these guys are pretty John Wainish, if you ask me.

374
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And the idea of having a for-profit army patrolling United States streets,

375
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
or whatever, or streets of Baghdad is,

376
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
sounds, I think it's constitutionally wrong, not sure,

377
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
but it certainly is morally fucking, it's just wrong.

378
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And I'm not going to play you anything from Naomi Wolf's, um, speech,

379
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
although it is, uh, of course I'll put a link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

380
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You have to watch this, and she's hot too, so you like that.

381
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
She's pleasant to watch.

382
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But I will play this, it's like five minutes, um, from video nation,

383
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
of course, link in show notes at dailysourcecode.com for this as well.

384
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And it's, it's a short video piece, it's actually about five minutes,

385
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
so I'll just play the whole thing if you don't mind.

386
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Um, and it's a titled Blackwater Shadow Army.

387
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And it's, uh, if there's anything on screen that needs to be read,

388
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'll read it for you, but this piece pretty much speaks for itself.

389
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Um, and I'm not quite sure what is the guy's name.

390
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Uh, I'll read it in a second.

391
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Let's start this off, hold on.

392
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll tell you who the guy is when it comes up, I'm screen.

393
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
One of the most frightening developments in the occupation of Iraq and the so-called war on-

394
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Okay, it's a Jeremy Scahil.

395
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
He is the author of, I guess, a book called Blackwater.

396
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay, let's continue.

397
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Er, it's actually something that most people have never heard of.

398
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
In addition to the 150,000 troops that the US has on the ground in Iraq,

399
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
the Bush administration has deployed a shadow army of some 100,000 contractors.

400
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Of these tens of thousands are heavily armed mercenaries that roam Iraq with impunity.

401
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Among the most powerful of the companies operating in Iraq is Blackwater,

402
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
USA, a secret of company based in the wilderness of North Carolina.

403
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's headed by a right wing, Christian conservative, bankroller of President Bush and his allies.

404
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And Blackwater envisions itself as the FedEx of the National Security apparatus.

405
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But the reality is that Blackwater has become a prime player in the war on terror,

406
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
nothing short of the Bush administration's Praetorian guard.

407
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Blackwater, USA largely operated in the shadows of the US war machine.

408
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Until the morning of March 31st, 2004, when four Blackwater contractors were ambushed and killed in the

409
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
SUNY City of Falugia, Iraq, their bodies were burned and dragged through the streets.

410
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Two of them hung from a bridge over the U.S. river.

411
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
For most people in the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States,

412
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States,

413
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
like through the streets, two of them hung from a bridge over the U.S. river.

414
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
For most people it was the first that they've ever heard of private military contractors operating in Iraq.

415
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That was the Moga dehum moment to the Iraq war.

416
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
In many ways it was the day the war turned.

417
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Unlike Somalia when the Clinton administration pulled out the Bush administration initiated a massive

418
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
revenge attack.

419
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
They laid siege to the city of Falugia killed hundreds of people, displaced tens of thousands of

420
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
others, and in the process infelame the Iraqi resistance that haunts U.S.

421
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,720
that haunts U.S. occupation forces to this day.

422
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,520
I didn't know that that was the reason for Fallujah.

423
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,200
This isn't pretty graphic imagery, too.

424
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,640
The Bush administration came to power

425
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,520
with a radical privatization agenda.

426
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,640
We see it in our schools, prisons, healthcare system,

427
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
and law enforcement in the United States.

428
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,800
The occupation of Iraq and the war on terror

429
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,400
had brought the greatest privatization

430
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,200
of warfare and modern history.

431
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,440
Blackwater USA has become one of the most powerful

432
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,120
private actors in the so-called war on terror.

433
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,560
It provides the Bush administration

434
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,880
with an extraordinary amount of political cover.

435
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,840
The deaths of blackwater contractors and other war contractors

436
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840
are not included in the total death count.

437
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,240
Even though some 780 of them have been killed in Iraq,

438
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,320
their injuries don't get calculated either.

439
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,120
Their crimes don't get punished.

440
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,880
What you have is a revolving door.

441
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,760
Blackwater and other companies benefit the Bush administration

442
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,240
and in turn, the Bush administration

443
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
and its Republican allies and Congress

444
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,240
have shielded these military contractors

445
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,280
from any effective oversight, any effective accountability,

446
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,880
any effective legal system.

447
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,120
Their operations are shrouded in secrecy

448
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,160
and people in Congress find it almost impossible

449
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
to get information about blackwater

450
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,880
and other companies' operations.

451
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,200
And we know virtually nothing about this.

452
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,000
We think about 40 cents of every dollar.

453
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
This is Democrat representative of Jan Chikowski,

454
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,600
of the House Intelligence Committee.

455
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,000
So listen very carefully to what's being said here.

456
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,200
This guy just said, well, you know,

457
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,120
they aren't held accountable by law and boy,

458
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,840
this was done in 2006 this video.

459
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,360
No shit.

460
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,520
So those guys were just granted immunity

461
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,440
if you read the news.

462
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,560
Immunity, there were immune from killing civilians,

463
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,120
civilians, killing civilians,

464
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,640
not the part of the United States Army.

465
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,800
It's crazy, I tell you.

466
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,240
Those two private military contractors,

467
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,080
we think about 800 of them have been killed in Iraq,

468
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,320
but we don't know that.

469
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,720
They're not even counted.

470
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,320
And we think there's about 25,000

471
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,320
to maybe 40,000 engaged in military activities

472
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,640
and combat related activities.

473
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,920
But we don't even know how many there are,

474
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,920
but that's a lot, man, 25, 40,000 outrageous.

475
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,760
We don't know.

476
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,080
And we can't find out.

477
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Hello, you can't find out.

478
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,600
Blackwater USA has 2300 men actively deployed

479
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,280
nine countries around the world.

480
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,320
They have an additional 20,000 contractors at the ready.

481
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,240
But while Blackwater has operated in Iraq and Afghanistan,

482
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,480
the company increasingly has its sights set

483
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,720
on deployments inside of the United States.

484
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,160
Blackwater is setting up a new facility in Illinois,

485
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,760
another one in California.

486
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,320
I was in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina

487
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,480
and I saw Blackwater mercenary speeding up

488
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,400
and down the streets and unmarked cars,

489
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,280
heavily armed with M4 machine guns,

490
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,840
flat jackets, other weapons strapped to their legs.

491
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,920
And when I talk to the Blackwater guys on the ground

492
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,000
and ask them what their mission was in New Orleans,

493
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,880
they said they were there to confront criminals

494
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,920
and stop looters.

495
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,880
To have mercenary companies which have operated in Iraq,

496
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,040
Afghanistan and elsewhere in the war on terror,

497
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,320
essentially declaring themselves above any effective laws.

498
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,720
Now deploying on the streets of US cities

499
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,560
should be seen as an ominous threat.

500
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,920
Yeah, that's totally the way I see it.

501
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,200
Completely an ominous threat.

502
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Definitely, yeah, 2006 by the nation corporation.

503
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,800
Great job on that.

504
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,320
You know, what are we going to do about this?

505
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,520
What Netanyahu Mewulf says is we need to impeach

506
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,640
the president and the entire administration.

507
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,680
Is it time for those types of discussions?

508
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,840
Has he actually,

509
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,000
has he committed treason?

510
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,120
What are we going to do?

511
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,200
We're just going to talk about it.

512
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,680
We're going to do something about it.

513
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,280
We're going to run around circles.

514
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,480
I'm so I really am thinking that this has to be stopped, man.

515
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,440
When you watch these two videos,

516
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,160
if you ever go to curie.com,

517
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,800
then you'll have seen the Naomi Whulf video.

518
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,200
I'd love to hear your feedback on it

519
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,160
because there's something quite a miss here, my friends.

520
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,280
Quite a miss.

521
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,240
Hey, Adam, Chris Lutterell, originally from Minnesota,

522
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,680
calling from Southern Germany, where I'm an ex-pap,

523
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,040
say I want to follow up on the whole zeitgeist

524
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,440
and follow the money.

525
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,280
After doing my taxes here the last couple of years,

526
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,480
or at least especially this year,

527
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,080
found out that the U.S. Congress has changed the laws

528
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,360
on ex-pats, they don't want to be raising tax.

529
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,800
As well, they've raised it on us and changed the law dynamics

530
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,400
for 2007 Ford, so we're actually praying incrementally

531
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:46,040
on our entire amount outside of the tax income tax credit

532
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,080
that we get normally living abroad.

533
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,920
But as I'm doing my research, we'll call in

534
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,720
and give you more information on that,

535
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,720
but just can't believe how two faces all can be.

536
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,960
So Ron Paul, very interesting.

537
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,560
I love the interview on 677.

538
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,640
And yeah, I think we need to heat this up going in

539
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,000
to 2008 because starting 2007 ex-pats around the world

540
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,960
are totally getting screwed with the new tax law

541
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,600
that was just tax, essentially double taxation.

542
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,720
Red pill, scruncher and proud of it,

543
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,640
and thought you had him carry it.

544
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,840
Yeah, yeah, yo.

545
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,360
Yo, yeah, I know it.

546
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,360
I have been made aware of the new ex-pats tax regulation.

547
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,960
And of course, for those of you who don't know,

548
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,720
United States citizens have to file a tax return.

549
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,960
Every year, regardless of where they live worldwide

550
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,800
and you can get credit.

551
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,800
So if I pay taxes in the UK or if I worked in the net

552
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,680
of the Netherlands and I paid to pay taxes there,

553
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,520
you don't get taxed again over the income in the States,

554
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,120
but that is apparently changing somewhat.

555
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,840
And can anyone actually explain it to me?

556
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,320
No.

557
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,120
All I hear is, hey, you're gonna get screwed.

558
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,760
So I'm not quite sure.

559
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,520
I'm sure that, no, actually,

560
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,520
one, I can be reasonably sure of is rich people.

561
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,680
We won't bother them that much.

562
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,720
It's just the way it always is.

563
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,880
But that doesn't mean it's right

564
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,680
and it doesn't mean I'm not gonna speak up about it.

565
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,000
I guarantee you.

566
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,520
Hey Adam, it's click on Monday after you know agenda show,

567
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,000
which by the way, I've listened to probably half of it.

568
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,640
Great, I like it.

569
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,880
It's the new show I'm doing with John DeVorek.

570
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,240
We'll probably do one this week, Thursday or Friday,

571
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,360
know agenda.podshow.com.

572
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,480
You only listen to half of it and you still like it?

573
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,800
Not.

574
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
You did an excellent job with that interview.

575
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,480
Just because you just laid back

576
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,120
and left the guy talking so fast.

577
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,880
So people, you had no agenda in your,

578
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,320
at least no parent agenda in your questions.

579
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,160
So that's it.

580
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,720
I guess he's talking about the Ron Paul interview.

581
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,120
Could draw whatever conclusions they want from it

582
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,320
because you have the tentative speak

583
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,840
without leading or trying to trap the tentative.

584
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,640
So it's extremely useful for people on both sides

585
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,480
to hear this guy talk his ideas through.

586
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,400
Excellent format.

587
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,200
I was wondering whether you're interested

588
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,240
or whether there's any chance you could get

589
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,640
any other candidates on either other Republican

590
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,000
candidates or other Democratic candidates

591
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,280
or other third party candidates.

592
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,200
Because it's something you never get in the main media

593
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,280
is, you know, a real chess just here

594
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,280
the person talked and felt out.

595
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,480
Yeah, yeah, of course, good point.

596
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,920
Although I'm pretty sure if, if I said right now,

597
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,360
let's get Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama

598
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,080
or Rudy Giuliani for that matter.

599
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,920
I don't care.

600
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,480
Any candidate, of course, I'll be honored

601
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,880
to speak to any one of them

602
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
and would give them the exact same courtesy

603
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,880
and exact same format of interview.

604
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,360
So if anyone wants to set that up, I'm your man.

605
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,000
You know that, definitely.

606
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,960
I'm not gonna go chasing him.

607
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,360
You know, I think Ron Paul was pretty amazing

608
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,920
within one week he was on the show.

609
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,760
That was pretty awesome.

610
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Let's see if we can do the same.

611
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,200
Please, please send the same emails to the other candidates

612
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,760
and I'll ask them the exact same questions.

613
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,520
See what they come up with?

614
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,160
We could, oh, we could even put them side by side.

615
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,000
Now, couldn't we?

616
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
We could actually play one, one candidates answers

617
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,080
to the other candidates.

618
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,080
See what their response is, kind of like a asymmetrical debate.

619
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,840
I'm up for it, man, definitely.

620
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,000
Just set me up and hook me up.

621
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,200
Because somebody like Hillary Clinton would be passing

622
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,680
to Hillary talk herself out

623
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,080
because she's always positioning.

624
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,520
It would be great to hear her only argue with herself.

625
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,080
Or Barack Obama or anybody.

626
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,360
Just hear them talk themselves out

627
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,280
and see if there's anything behind what they say.

628
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,760
Because I have to say at least Ron Paul

629
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,120
has a consistent set of principle

630
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,680
that he applies to every question.

631
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,880
I mean, I agree with all the conclusions,

632
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,440
but still he has a consistent set

633
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,960
that he applies, which is excellent.

634
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,160
So thank you very much.

635
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,960
And good luck to you.

636
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,720
You're showing the power of your media.

637
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,720
And I have to know you listen that it doesn't bad.

638
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,560
Fuck you Adam.

639
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,840
Yeah, yeah, it's a start, isn't it?

640
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,640
That's for sure.

641
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,360
I'd love to do this with you guys every single day

642
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,280
and really produce it and do nothing else.

643
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,240
Just not in the cards for me yet.

644
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,280
Be a while longer, I'm sure.

645
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,400
Enjoying what I can.

646
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,880
Yeah, so again, the format of the interview

647
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,480
if you haven't heard at Daily Source Code episode

648
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,400
677, it's what new media I think is good at.

649
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,000
We don't, everyone's laughing about the long-winded intro

650
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,840
that I did, but I wanted this guy to know

651
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,160
that he can talk for as long as he wants.

652
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,120
He doesn't have to worry about me getting off the air

653
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,920
or hitting a commercial break or hitting the top of the news

654
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,200
at the hour for the news or any of that.

655
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,080
Just talk man, no worry about it.

656
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,120
There's a fast forward button

657
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,000
if you're boring people shuttles through it.

658
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,880
That's just that simple.

659
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,440
Tell you what, today being October 30th,

660
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,080
one more day tomorrow is, of course, Halloween.

661
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,080
So let's honor it from the Pod Sabies Ignatwork

662
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,160
and the Martians, the Pumpkin Grays.

663
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,680
When he happened, now he's the Pumpkin Grays.

664
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,680
We got this one.

665
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,120
I was so mad, I didn't even find so bright for the camp.

666
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,240
The light and the jump didn't sign cause they were not brave.

667
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,440
This thought didn't ring on the garden.

668
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,320
I think the save, I think the top of the dark, the dark.

669
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,440
Making it in way, I call my daily jump.

670
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,840
Didn't sign cause they were not brave.

671
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,640
As the night's roll, one of the children came in the toy

672
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
and jokes in the show, they're ready.

673
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,440
They dance for cheats, apples, nuts,

674
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,960
and sweets, and we feed it their backs with nice things.

675
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,200
The only one they turned around and they saw the grail

676
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,440
and charge the name of the bucket day.

677
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,040
They jumped in fright cause they were not brave.

678
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,040
But now, here they lie on the pumpkin grave.

679
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,040
When the wheels turned round,

680
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,640
the whip, shark came in the dead, woke up and got out there.

681
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,440
When they knocked the doors in the show, they ran.

682
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,840
Stop the doors with the shells you gave.

683
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,640
They turned around and they saw the grail and the children dead.

684
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,840
My bucket day!

685
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,440
They jumped in fright cause they were not brave.

686
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,240
Now, here they lie on the pumpkin grave.

687
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,040
We quave a year until after to the year and after we all end blue.

688
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,240
We unlocked the doors with the thing to do and we ran.

689
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Outside, put without the blue.

690
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,840
We turned around and we saw the grail and the dead, the kids.

691
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,840
And we jumped in fright cause they were not brave.

692
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,840
Now, here they lie on the pumpkin grave.

693
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,840
They jumped in fright cause they were not brave.

694
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:32,840
And on Christmas night, we are getting out of the grave.

695
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:39,840
With our pumpkin heads and the one called day.

696
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:46,840
We'll greet through the streets and have brains to eat.

697
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:53,840
And you'll jump in fright cause you won't be brave.

698
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,840
And then here you lie on the pumpkin grave.

699
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,840
I'm the pumpkin.

700
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:10,840
The pumpkin grave.

701
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
The pumpkin grave.

702
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,840
The marshans from the pod save music never find out all about them.

703
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:40,840
At podshow.com slash music course directly at DavySourceco.com.

704
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
Alrighty.

705
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
So as I said tomorrow, no show.

706
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,840
If you have any suggestions for something to take along with me on the airplane.

707
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,840
So upon arrival, I always sleep on the plane.

708
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,840
So when I get in around three o'clock in the afternoon and San Francisco,

709
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,840
I like to go to the office and say hi to everybody.

710
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840
So kind of get some juice flowing.

711
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,840
I don't want to sleep anyway.

712
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,840
But everyone's going to be dressed up in there in the Halloween costume.

713
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
So what should I be wearing?

714
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,840
Something I can take along with me and just maybe I...

715
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
That's too easy.

716
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
Well anyway, if you have an idea, let me know.

717
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Okay.
