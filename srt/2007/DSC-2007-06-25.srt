1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Are you tired of that yet?

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Me too.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,720
This is Matt DiTilo of Matt's Today in History, and on this day in 2007, I helped

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,160
pod show suck a little less by putting together a shorter blur of asking you, a podcast

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,200
producer and listener, to visit suckless.podshow.com, and sign up to participate in some

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,000
pod show surveys that will make a difference.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Once the last time a media company asks for your opinion, never?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well then, let's make some history together.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Visit suckless.podshow.com, and get involved.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the best show on the internet.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's the DSE6203.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
then the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Adam Curry was just a guy with big hair who sold his first company and thought he'd

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
just kick back and take it easy, but he never counted on this.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Adam and Patricia, the king and queen of the matter, or just the lady and the

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
tramp, only on the daily source code.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And with this angel from above, there's nothing that they both can't do.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll make you wildest dreams come true.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So grab your ear buds and gentlemen, and let the fabulous show begin.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's Adam and Patricia.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, Adam and Patricia.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Adam and the lady Patricia.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You sure are a birding man, Adam.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If I was poor, I bet I was looking for you.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And just the best of the attention.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, but there's a broad that you need to believe.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, there's the broad attention.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
When you've had it with me, I know that you're true.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And you're swallowing in the communication.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're true.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're not in the room of the nation, see.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:59,980
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, just you okay?

36
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:13,420
Just the way the way the way the way the way the way you dressed, right, right, right, right...

37
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:43,420
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

saying

41
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,100
SHARE

42
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:19,420
I've been told to a problem, and come in the other world

43
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:26,420
And don't miss me, don't miss me, just you, don't miss me

44
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,420
Don't miss me, just you, don't miss me, don't miss me

45
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:35,420
I have no sense, no matter how long I'll tell

46
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,420
Oh, nothing I'll tell, oh, nothing I'll tell

47
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:45,420
Oh, nothing I'll tell, nothing I'll tell

48
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,420
Oh, nothing I'll tell, I'll tell, oh, no, nothing I'll tell

49
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,420
Oh, nothing I'll tell, oh, nothing I'll tell

50
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,420
Oh, nothing left me, no, no

51
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,420
Oh, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

52
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,420
Now let's take it back

53
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,420
Oh, c'mon, c'mon

54
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,420
Now let's take it back

55
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,420
Now let's take it back

56
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,420
Now let's take it back

57
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,420
now let's take it back

58
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
Now let's take it back

59
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
Now let's take it back

60
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,420
Now let's take it back

61
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,420
Well well well well

62
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,420
Will'll take it back

63
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,420
They never stop.

64
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,420
No, they don't. It just keeps on going.

65
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,420
I think it's a real life band probably.

66
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,420
At the end, they just run away from you.

67
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,420
But isn't that an awesome song?

68
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,420
It is a great song.

69
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,420
I love those guys.

70
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,420
Yeah, a little bit too much at the end.

71
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,420
What do you mean too much?

72
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,420
It runs away suddenly.

73
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,420
It just runs away.

74
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,420
It runs away from you.

75
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,420
What is it?

76
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,420
It's 60, 70s, stones,

77
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,420
a donko-gumala game melting pot.

78
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,420
The band sound can be described as high energy rock and roll,

79
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,420
drawing heavily from mod, soul, garage,

80
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,420
and British invasion influences.

81
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Oh, absolutely.

82
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,420
Yeah.

83
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

84
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
Daily source code episode,

85
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,420
623 coming to you from the curry manner.

86
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,420
And as promised,

87
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,420
the lady Patricia on the microphone.

88
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,420
Hi, everybody.

89
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,420
Hi, Adam.

90
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,420
Hey, baby. Good to have you on the show.

91
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,420
Oh, nice.

92
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,420
Nice to hear somebody so happy.

93
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
Yeah, well, I am very happy.

94
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,420
It's been, uh, how long has it been?

95
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,420
A month, maybe even longer than since the last time you appeared on this program.

96
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
Right.

97
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,420
And it's so good to see you because I was basically on, uh, on tour.

98
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,420
On tour, yes.

99
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,420
A three-wing, a three-wing.

100
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,420
A three-wing.

101
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,420
A three-wing.

102
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,420
A three-wing.

103
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,420
It was much more wanked than that during the three weeks that I was on the road.

104
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,420
It was a three-week world tour.

105
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,420
Did you miss me?

106
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,420
Yeah, I went.

107
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,420
You wank?

108
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,420
Ah, righty.

109
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,420
How many times?

110
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,420
Shut up.

111
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,420
But so, so...

112
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,420
I really missed you.

113
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
I know.

114
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,420
It was so long this time.

115
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
It failed very long.

116
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,420
Well, it was a long time because, uh, normally, um,

117
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,420
normally it's a week, but, uh,

118
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,420
um, on longer trips it's 10 or 11 days.

119
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,420
And this time it was, it was like 10 days for me to get back from,

120
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,420
New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Washington.

121
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,420
And then I was home for, like, a day and a half,

122
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,420
and then went straight to Con.

123
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,420
And you did a couple of shows?

124
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
Did a couple of...

125
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Yeah, you always called it you show.

126
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,420
Yeah, well, I came home and I had to do a show.

127
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,420
Yeah, that was very difficult, uh, Friday night, right?

128
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Yeah, because I came home Thursday, Thursday,

129
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,420
and I had no energy left.

130
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,420
I was, I was, like, passing out everywhere.

131
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,420
But also, the things that you do when you're on the road,

132
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,420
you know, it's showing somebody or something.

133
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,420
Oh, you mean the showing.

134
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,420
Good show, you're doing on the road.

135
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
Well, okay.

136
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,420
Well, that was, um, it wasn't really a show.

137
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
I was on a panel.

138
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420
I know that.

139
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,420
Do you know the woman that I had dinner with?

140
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
Yeah.

141
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
When did the Lord?

142
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420
Yes.

143
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
Oh.

144
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
I thought I told you.

145
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,420
You know, I told you it's the chief sales officer of Yahoo,

146
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,420
really powerful, uh, force in the advertising business.

147
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Yeah.

148
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,420
And I told you that I had, you know, like an argument with her on the panel.

149
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,420
Did I tell you that?

150
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,420
No.

151
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,420
Well, I had, you know, like a good argument, though.

152
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,420
Yeah.

153
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,420
And then, uh, and, and that's what she said, oh, you have to come to dinner.

154
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,420
I was like, okay.

155
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,420
And then we'll couple other people there.

156
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,420
Um, and I said, look, this argument that we had could have only ended in, in one way.

157
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,420
I said, I, and I'll still do the same thing.

158
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,420
Uh, I, I want to offer you a job.

159
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,420
You have to come.

160
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,420
Come and work at Pod Show.

161
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,420
And she's laughing.

162
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,420
She was, you know, she's, oh, that's right.

163
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,420
You know, flattering.

164
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,420
And today, I read that she actually left Yahoo.

165
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,420
And she's now gone to work from Martha Stewart.

166
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,420
No.

167
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
Yes.

168
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,420
She's still different.

169
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,420
Exactly.

170
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,420
Oh, my God.

171
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,420
I was like, man, if you had the excuse.

172
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,420
She was because of the argument?

173
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,420
No, no, no, no, nothing to do with it.

174
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,420
She was probably, I mean, that was probably also.

175
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,420
I don't know.

176
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,420
You went all the bad thing.

177
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,420
I was about to, it was just, you know, about advertising.

178
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
It was fun.

179
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
It was just bantering back and forth.

180
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,420
Yeah.

181
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,420
Keeping the audience awake.

182
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
Yeah.

183
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,420
Uh, but she, uh, she, uh, she left.

184
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,420
She left.

185
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
Yeah.

186
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,420
So she knew probably when I was, when I was kind of half jokingly, but, of course,

187
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,420
very seriously offering a job.

188
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,420
She probably had already accepted the job with Martha Stewart.

189
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,420
Oh, okay.

190
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,420
And I'm thinking, if you had the choose between working with Adam Curry and Ron Bloom or Martha Stewart,

191
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,420
I think you, you guys are so cool.

192
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,420
It seems like a very obvious choice to me.

193
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,420
Yeah.

194
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,420
Anywho.

195
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,420
Because you don't want to smell like ham, would you always say?

196
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,420
I'm telling me, yeah, when we had our office in the same building as Martha Stewart,

197
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,420
I remember that.

198
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,420
Whenever Martha Stewart was in the elevator, it smelled like ham.

199
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,420
And yeah, I said, if you didn't let me say, but she smells like ham.

200
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,420
She does.

201
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,420
I think Ken would say that even better.

202
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,420
Really?

203
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,420
She's not like ham.

204
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,420
Oh.

205
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,420
It's strange, isn't it?

206
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,420
So what did you do while I was gone?

207
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,420
Well, actually, I'm exercising my voice a little bit.

208
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:49,420
Because I noticed that if you don't sing that much, that distracts in your vocal cords.

209
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,420
Get on stretch.

210
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,420
Yeah, get on stretch a little bit.

211
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,420
Steph.

212
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,420
Why are you planning on using your vocal cords?

213
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,420
Anything, lady Patricia?

214
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,420
Everybody's always asking, when is Patricia going to sing?

215
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,420
Yeah.

216
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:09,420
And so I thought, you know, after the dancing and feeling feeling a lot of energy in my body,

217
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,420
why not try to sing a little bit?

218
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,420
So after I did, you know, what we spoke about the last time in the last show,

219
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,420
we did together.

220
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,420
What was that?

221
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,420
We talked about dancing with the stars.

222
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
And I did the star sisters, remember?

223
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,420
Yeah.

224
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,420
Well, that was a great success.

225
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,420
Everybody liked it.

226
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,420
And it was like a party.

227
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,420
Everybody was standing up, the audience.

228
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,420
And it was like we never left.

229
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
It was fun.

230
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,420
It was a lot of fun.

231
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,420
It was like a warm blanket of love.

232
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,420
It was like just rolled over you.

233
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,420
Yes.

234
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,420
Yeah.

235
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,420
One of my colleagues, Yelik Arbetti always says,

236
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,420
It's like a warm blanket.

237
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,420
You can't live without it.

238
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,420
Yes.

239
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,420
I don't feel like that you know that.

240
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,420
But the moment you did it.

241
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,420
You liked it.

242
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,420
You liked it.

243
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,420
What I always liked, I noticed that I missed the tension.

244
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
No, no, no.

245
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,420
It's not all about the tension.

246
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,420
No, no.

247
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,420
It's the fun that you have from it.

248
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,420
And the moving around and the energy that you put in it.

249
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,420
And I think also, let me think.

250
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,420
Don't hurt yourself.

251
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,420
Being creative.

252
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,420
Being creative.

253
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,420
That I can understand.

254
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:27,420
You know, being creative because of the TV gig that we did.

255
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,420
You've got like all kinds of offers coming up.

256
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,420
Yeah, we've got offers.

257
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,420
So I'm thinking about doing a couple of gigs.

258
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,420
Why don't you once you just move back to Holland.

259
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Oh, my god.

260
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,420
My god.

261
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,420
You have really.

262
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
I mean, it's like, no, life used to.

263
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,420
I'm about it.

264
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,420
Life used to evolve around me.

265
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,420
You have to.

266
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,420
Now we have to.

267
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,420
Now we have to think about your agenda.

268
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,420
But you are always the person is that you have to sing.

269
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,420
You don't forget.

270
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,420
Yes, sure.

271
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,420
But not in Holland.

272
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,420
He was happy.

273
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,420
Well, that's where there's, you know, where I'm famous.

274
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,420
So that's easier for me than somewhere else and starting all over.

275
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,420
Although we have a couple of things going on here in the.

276
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,420
Oh, you say.

277
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,420
Yeah, we're not for bid.

278
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,420
We're not for bid.

279
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,420
You actually catch a fire.

280
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,420
Oh, man.

281
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,420
We're not going to tell our.

282
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,420
How are we ever going to coordinate our careers here?

283
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
I mean, you know.

284
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,420
We've got some invitations for maybe.

285
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,420
We, um, some shows in here in, um, um,

286
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,420
English television.

287
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,420
We'll see.

288
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,420
We'll see.

289
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,420
Yeah, we'll see.

290
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,420
So, um, we had a, a really nice weekend.

291
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,420
We played together a lot.

292
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,420
Yeah.

293
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,420
Didn't we?

294
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
It's up for Saturday.

295
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,420
Yeah.

296
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,420
Yeah.

297
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,420
I was waiting here for you to come back.

298
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,420
Oh, that night was a wonderful night because we went out for dinner.

299
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,420
Well, first of all, our daughter decided to have a sleepover at some

300
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,420
friend's house.

301
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
Yeah.

302
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,420
So that's always good news.

303
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,420
Yeah.

304
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
Because then we have the house all to ourselves.

305
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,420
And I have to say she is hurting this month.

306
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
You know, the last couple of.

307
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,420
Yeah.

308
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,420
That you have to elaborate on that because I have not to discuss this in the show.

309
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,420
Oh, is enough.

310
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,420
No, no, no working.

311
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,420
I didn't.

312
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,420
Well, you, you, you started it.

313
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,420
So what I mean, you so now you have to, you have to finish it.

314
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,420
Well, all the parents know that if your teenage daughter,

315
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,420
uh, is in love was in love who are, you know, has,

316
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
or whatever they think love is.

317
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,420
They think love is.

318
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,420
Um, and, uh, they have some problems with that with the relationship.

319
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,420
Oh, the first one.

320
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,420
They don't want to listen to you.

321
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,420
Whatever you say, it's like almost it's not going into the brain.

322
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,420
Yeah.

323
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,420
Well, did you accept anything your parents told you when you were 17

324
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,420
years old?

325
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,420
No.

326
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,420
Absolutely.

327
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
You left the house.

328
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
You were so non-acceptive of what they had to say.

329
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
Yeah.

330
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,420
But I keep telling her the whole story.

331
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,420
What happened.

332
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,420
And, and I, I took so much differently to her than my parents did.

333
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,420
And she knows.

334
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,420
She tells me everything.

335
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,420
I couldn't tell my parents.

336
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,420
She certainly does tell you everything.

337
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,420
Yeah.

338
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
I mean, she always hates me because I'll tell you.

339
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,420
And then you tell me.

340
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,420
And then I do say, I'm not alone.

341
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,420
Oh, what?

342
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
How come I can't know everything.

343
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,420
I want to know all of this.

344
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,420
Actually, I don't want to know everything.

345
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,420
Yeah.

346
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
Don't want to know.

347
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,420
No.

348
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
There's more that you haven't told me.

349
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,420
No, no, no, no.

350
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,420
I mean, you always very flabbergasted.

351
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,420
Completely fabricized.

352
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
Yeah.

353
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,420
But so, um, uh,

354
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,420
So anyway, so she, so she needed to be with her friends and eat ice cream with, uh, you know,

355
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
you know, on the couch, watch and tell her vision.

356
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,420
Yeah.

357
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,420
Curl up and, and, uh, disgusty.

358
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,420
I think it's all going to be a, it'll be okay with our love birds or, or not.

359
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,420
I don't know.

360
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,420
Who knows.

361
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,420
Yeah.

362
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,420
I don't know.

363
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,420
I'm hard broken.

364
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,420
Yeah.

365
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
I'm hard broken too from it.

366
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,420
Yeah.

367
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,420
Yeah.

368
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
We knew that.

369
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,420
Well, you said to see your daughter like that because she's so much, you know,

370
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,420
but it's, she's so young and she thinks that this is the end of the world.

371
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,420
I keep telling her. I said, you know, it's like, you know, how coincidental is it,

372
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,420
that of all the guys in the world, all the places we've lived, that the one guy that is the,

373
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,420
the man for the rest of her life is in Guilford.

374
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,420
Yeah.

375
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,420
You know, it's possible there may be some,

376
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,420
maybe there's some other stuff out there you don't want to look at.

377
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,420
You don't know.

378
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
You never know.

379
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
You never can tell.

380
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
That's what I keep telling her.

381
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
That's what I keep saying.

382
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,420
You're only starting.

383
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,420
You have to test drive a lot of cars.

384
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,420
You know, like that.

385
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,420
How many test drives did you do?

386
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,420
My dear.

387
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
Can you count them?

388
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,420
Not mine.

389
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,420
I think not many.

390
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,420
If you, if you.

391
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
I saw an study.

392
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
I saw an study.

393
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,420
The teenagers these days, they count like 30, 40.

394
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,420
Oh, I already had 30.

395
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
Oh, God.

396
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,420
I read in a study somewhere that the average number of pre,

397
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,420
marital sexual relations that women have had in.

398
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,420
Gosh, I think it was, I think it was the United States.

399
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,420
Mm.

400
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,420
Was four.

401
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,420
Which seems really low to me.

402
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,420
Wow.

403
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
Yeah.

404
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,420
Seems really low.

405
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
Now for me, I think it was,

406
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
and maybe that were a couple of that.

407
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,420
Stop counting on your toes.

408
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,420
I don't know anymore because it's not,

409
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,420
I was so not impressed.

410
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,420
So probably,

411
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,420
maybe eight.

412
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Really?

413
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
Be 10.

414
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
Not much than that.

415
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,420
That's it.

416
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,420
And I wish I did more, you know.

417
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,420
Really?

418
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,420
Yeah.

419
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,420
Well, dear.

420
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
But as long as I can watch,

421
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,420
you can have as many more as you want.

422
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
I was so proud of them.

423
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,420
See, I was busy with music and other things.

424
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,420
And when you are, you know, when I was at my age,

425
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,420
I was about 16 when I did my first recording.

426
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,420
And from that moment on,

427
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
actually,

428
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,420
famous in my country,

429
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,420
which was different than now,

430
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
of course.

431
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,420
But when you were famous,

432
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,420
then there were only maybe a couple of people

433
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,420
that were really, really famous in these.

434
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,420
And you couldn't go anywhere.

435
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,420
Yeah.

436
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,420
You weren't TV and if you weren't TV,

437
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,420
everybody's seen it.

438
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,420
And that was actually.

439
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,420
So you were like, you're kind of like Michael Jackson.

440
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,420
Yeah, a little bit.

441
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,420
Well, not, you can't.

442
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
Michael Jackson, of course,

443
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,420
these.

444
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,420
He's never, I mean,

445
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,420
a sexual like Michael Jackson.

446
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
He's, you know,

447
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,420
famous all over the world.

448
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,420
He cannot.

449
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,420
I'm from Holland.

450
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,420
Yeah.

451
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,420
He's the jury will disregard.

452
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,420
So, you know,

453
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
I couldn't go out.

454
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
I couldn't go out.

455
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Couldn't have fun with teenagers.

456
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,420
So I actually skipped that a little bit.

457
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,420
That's why I always stayed a teenager.

458
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,420
I think in my head.

459
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,420
So how do we get from Christina to you again?

460
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,420
I don't know.

461
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
Once again, it's about me.

462
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,420
How many did I have?

463
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,420
Right.

464
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,420
That was the question.

465
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,420
So I said,

466
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,420
I didn't have the time for it.

467
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,420
So that's why I wasn't that much.

468
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,420
I think I had more than 10.

469
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,420
Well, thank God for that.

470
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
That's very important.

471
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Yes, it is.

472
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,420
I wouldn't like to have a geek that didn't do it that much.

473
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,420
You know what I mean?

474
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
But I was good out of the gate.

475
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,420
Wasn't I?

476
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Very good.

477
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,420
So we had a play date.

478
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,420
Yeah.

479
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
So we, that's.

480
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,420
Right.

481
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,420
We had a lovely dinner.

482
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,420
I have to say it was,

483
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,420
we usually sit in the restaurant much shorter than that.

484
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,420
We really, we stayed for like more than an hour,

485
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,420
which for us is a long time.

486
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,420
Well, the thing is when we sit in the restaurant,

487
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,420
we actually have something to say to each other.

488
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,420
We always talk.

489
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
I have to constantly say,

490
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
you're not alone.

491
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
And next to the aga,

492
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
to tone it down a little bit.

493
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,420
You're really fucking loud.

494
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
Talking.

495
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
And your phone's gone.

496
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,420
Baby, baby, baby.

497
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
Really?

498
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
That's my daughter.

499
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,420
You are like a one big noise box.

500
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,420
Oh, you know.

501
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,420
I can't take you anywhere.

502
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,420
Very loud and happy.

503
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,420
But anyway, so we had a little bit.

504
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,420
And she's, and we're sitting there.

505
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,420
And after the art derves,

506
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,420
you know, the,

507
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,420
the waitress said,

508
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,420
I was Chinese.

509
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,420
Is that you finish?

510
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
No, she's no Chinese.

511
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,420
She's a Vietnamese.

512
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,420
Vietnamese.

513
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,420
Are you finished?

514
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,420
And you said,

515
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,420
yes.

516
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,420
What?

517
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,420
You kept selling her everything.

518
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,420
No, you can have it.

519
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,420
She actually looked off.

520
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,420
I looked a little bit for you.

521
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,420
And she actually went,

522
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,420
oh, thank you.

523
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,420
Like, fuck you.

524
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,420
I just took.

525
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,420
I just took that girl up your ass.

526
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
She just didn't want that.

527
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,420
Did you?

528
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,420
No.

529
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,420
It's for you.

530
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,420
And you have it then.

531
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,420
But then you asked,

532
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,420
you asked for tea.

533
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
And they gave you Chinese tea,

534
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,420
which were convinced is actually

535
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,420
dish washing water.

536
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,420
Yeah.

537
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,420
And I did that.

538
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,420
If they put you,

539
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,420
you know,

540
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,420
they give a big part of

541
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,420
Chinese,

542
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,420
or Vietnamese,

543
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,420
or whatever of Thai tea.

544
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
It has no color.

545
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
Yes.

546
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,420
It's brownish.

547
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
It really leaves in it somewhere.

548
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
And I think.

549
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,420
Which could be like chives from someone's

550
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,420
between someone's tea.

551
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,420
And we always think that somebody in the kitchen

552
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,420
is, you know,

553
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
looking at us and see.

554
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,420
They think.

555
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
They're drinking the dish water again.

556
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,420
They think they drink,

557
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
you know,

558
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,420
oriental tea.

559
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,420
It's just water.

560
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,420
It doesn't taste like anything.

561
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,420
It doesn't.

562
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,420
Oh, God.

563
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,420
So we had a play day.

564
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,420
Yeah.

565
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,420
Anyway, so we came home.

566
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,420
And Patricia,

567
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,420
you know,

568
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,420
who has become this like surfing

569
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,420
mevan,

570
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,420
found this website called

571
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,420
SingShot.com.

572
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,420
This is awesome.

573
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
And you'd have remembered the name.

574
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,420
How did you remember the name?

575
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
The song.

576
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,420
SingShot.com.

577
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,420
She was like,

578
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,420
What was the name of that site?

579
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,420
I said,

580
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,420
Well, singShot.com.

581
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,420
And you said.

582
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,420
And you said,

583
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,420
Oh, I remember that.

584
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,420
I just think about calm show.

585
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,420
I'm glad you're laughing about your own.

586
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,420
I'm glad you're laughing about your own.

587
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,420
You see.

588
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,420
Yes.

589
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,420
CalmShot.com.

590
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,420
You're right.

591
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,420
But this is awesome.

592
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,420
They have.

593
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,420
Don't tell everybody.

594
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,420
It's great sight.

595
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,420
Now it's a great sight.

596
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,420
Yeah, it is a great sight.

597
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,420
It's kind of like a karaoke.

598
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,420
Yeah.

599
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,420
It sounds a bit better than the other karaoke.

600
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,420
Well, yeah.

601
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,420
So all the tracks are actually really good.

602
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,420
And then you can hook up your microphone or even your webcam.

603
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
And then you can sing along.

604
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
Yeah.

605
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,420
And you can compete.

606
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,420
Yeah.

607
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,420
It's like an American Idol social network.

608
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,420
It's fun.

609
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,420
Yeah.

610
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
It's an awesome, awesome.

611
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,420
Awesome.

612
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,420
And we had a lot of fun.

613
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,420
Didn't we?

614
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,420
In fact.

615
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,420
You have to.

616
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
You have to.

617
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,420
You want to.

618
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,420
Do you want to sing with one of them right now?

619
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,420
Yeah.

620
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,420
Okay.

621
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,420
I'll give you another example.

622
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,420
Hold on.

623
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,420
Then I have to give you a little bit of, uh,

624
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,420
I have to give you some, uh, some.

625
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,420
Let's take one of,

626
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420
some that we did last night.

627
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
Hold on.

628
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,420
I need to hook up your echo.

629
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,420
Give me some.

630
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,420
Okay.

631
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,420
Check.

632
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,420
Check.

633
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,420
Check.

634
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
Check.

635
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,420
Check.

636
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,420
I mean, no more.

637
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:45,420
You didn't do.

638
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:53,420
Now you say you're lonely.

639
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,420
You cried the whole night alone.

640
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:04,420
Where you can't cry when you're with her.

641
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,420
Cry when you're with her.

642
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:15,420
I cried when you're with her.

643
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:22,420
Now you say you're sorry.

644
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:29,420
Oh, for me so, I'm true.

645
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:35,420
Where you can cry when you're with her.

646
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,420
Cry when you're with her.

647
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:47,420
I cried when you're with her.

648
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,420
You're drooling and you drooling.

649
00:24:51,420 --> 00:25:01,420
Out of my head, while you never shed a tear

650
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:09,420
Remember, I remember, all that you said

651
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:20,420
Tell me love was to begin, told me you were with me and now

652
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:33,420
You say you love me, well, just for you to come on in

653
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:45,420
Promise me you're with me, I'm glad you're with me

654
00:25:50,420 --> 00:26:11,420
I cried the river over you, and I cried the river over you

655
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:27,420
I cried the river over you, and I cried the river over you

656
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,420
Nice stretching of the vocal cords, baby

657
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:39,420
It's almost an ocean

658
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,420
An ocean

659
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,420
I love the way those lyrics go across the screen

660
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,420
That's an awesome sight

661
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,420
I think your vocal cords work fine

662
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:55,420
No, no, no, I'm still a little bit too low here in there, I can tell

663
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:00,420
You know, the vocal cords don't listen to me right away

664
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,420
But it's getting there, it's coming back

665
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,420
So what's happening next week?

666
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:10,420
And I did the last week, I think about ignore whatever I said

667
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:16,420
Whatever you say, I'm used to do that on TV in the talk shows

668
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,420
Do you interview any questions?

669
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,420
Any questions that I don't like, I just asked you what you're doing next week

670
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,420
No, I was telling that I just wanted to say that last week we did about

671
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:34,420
I think 38 interviews Ivana and I for a local radio station in Holland

672
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
Really? How many?

673
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
I think 38.

674
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,420
Also you have nothing left to say, is that what you're saying?

675
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,420
No, what I mean is that my brains are a little bit mushy

676
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,420
A little bit Dutch

677
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,420
Oh, I see

678
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,420
That's another byproduct that keep warning you about that

679
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,420
You're English is deteriorating

680
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,420
I know, especially when I speak so much Dutch

681
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,420
Yeah, yeah

682
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:03,420
So because I heard that a lot of people say that if I speak English, I speak a lot of

683
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,420
No, I speak a lot

684
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,420
Lazyer and a lot of slower

685
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,420
That's because my brain are not catching up

686
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:23,420
Yeah, because they saw me on the internet talk my own language

687
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,420
And that goes a lot faster, I have to say

688
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,420
So we have a new Prime Minister coming in, I wanted to ask you your opinion

689
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:36,420
Not that you necessarily follow all of the ins and outs of British politics

690
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,420
But you can see the two guys, we have Tony Blair going out

691
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,420
And Gordon Brown coming in, your thoughts, lady Patricia

692
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,420
Well, of course, I don't know what they expect from their new leadership

693
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,420
Leadership, I think leadership is a good leadership

694
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,420
But what I can say as a human being listening to this guy

695
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,420
To Gordon Brown

696
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,420
I also always have to think about it

697
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,420
So Gordon Brown

698
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,420
The strongest

699
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,420
Let me see if I can find that

700
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,420
Gordon Brown

701
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:12,420
Someone should do that, that's an awesome school

702
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,420
But if I listen to his voice, which is very important

703
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,420
I agree

704
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,420
I think he has sort of a fatherly sound in his voice

705
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,420
Which is very, very good

706
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,420
He sounds very trustful

707
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,420
Kind of comforting

708
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,420
Yeah, comforting, that's it, yeah

709
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,420
So that's good, that's good thing

710
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,420
You did some good things, I think as Chancellor that he basically stopped the UK

711
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,420
Well, they could have had the referendum, but he made sure that the UK didn't go

712
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,420
To the Euro

713
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
Yeah

714
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,420
And stayed with the non-stirling

715
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,420
Which I think is really, I think that's very smart

716
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,420
Look at the economy here, it's unbelievable

717
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
Unbelievable

718
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
Yeah

719
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,420
So it's probably, maybe a good politician

720
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,420
I don't understand it, what's you keep

721
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
One second

722
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,420
Stranglers

723
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,420
Yeah

724
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,420
Want to be funny if I could find it

725
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,420
And somebody has to do this, Gordon Brown

726
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,420
Give up what's the rest of the lyrics

727
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,420
What can we moving from 11 Downing to 10

728
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
10

729
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,420
Gordon Brown

730
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,420
It's not going very fast

731
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,420
Napster still says search

732
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,420
And he has a nice face

733
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,420
You see, I look at these things

734
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,420
Sometimes you get somebody's saying, oh, I don't like his face

735
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:31,420
And I'm like his voice, it just doesn't work

736
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,420
Well, Blair didn't have such a great voice

737
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,420
I thought he was sexy

738
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,420
Blair

739
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,420
Here it is

740
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,420
You have Blair with sexy?

741
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,420
Yes, I thought so

742
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,420
Was or still is

743
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,420
Still is

744
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,420
I'm going to do the live live with me

745
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,420
I don't know

746
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,420
We should write some lyrics

747
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,420
And then get the karaoke version

748
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,420
Yeah

749
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,420
Here comes

750
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,420
Gordon Brown

751
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,420
Text you like that

752
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,420
He lays me down

753
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,420
He lays me down

754
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,420
You're going from 11 Downing to 10

755
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,420
Never a friend

756
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,420
Never a friend

757
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,420
Every time

758
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
Just like that

759
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,420
That was a great song, wasn't it?

760
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
I love that song

761
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,420
Yeah

762
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,420
That totally totally springs for someone

763
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,420
Do that, you're so right

764
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,420
There's never a friend

765
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,420
That Gordon Brown

766
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,420
That's funny

767
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,420
Yeah

768
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,420
So the names here are so fantastic

769
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,420
You didn't you say

770
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,420
I heard somebody doing the

771
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,420
The weather and she says

772
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,420
This is Fennelafar

773
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
Fennelafar

774
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
Fennelafar

775
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,420
Yeah, that's on radio too

776
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,420
With Steve right in the afternoon

777
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,420
Fennelafar

778
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,420
Should we hear Fennelafar

779
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,420
So Miss Fudge

780
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,420
This is Fennelafar

781
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,420
She has a wonderful voice

782
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
She does

783
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
She has a great voice

784
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,420
You know, she's going to be really really beat-looking

785
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,420
She has a great voice

786
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,420
She has the perfect voice for radio

787
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Good

788
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
Yeah, vanilla Fudge

789
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,420

790
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,420
I'm vanilla Fudge

791
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,420
You can judge my Fudge

792
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
No, no, no

793
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,420
It is time for you to touch the Fudge

794
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420

What do you want to do?

798
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,420
Some music?

00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,420
Yeah, he puts all that stuff out pod save

802
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
How would Jones?

803
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420
I would not

804
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,420

805
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420

00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,420
Don't give me that face

807
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,420
Be arch

808
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420

00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,420
So you said to me, what are you going to do?

907
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,420
My plans are for next week

908
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,420
You're going to fly me over to Holland

909
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,420
Fly me to Holland

910
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,420
Yes

911
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,420
And get your hair cut

912
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,420
The favors country

913
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,420
And while you're there too

914
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,420
I know

915
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,420
Get rid of that mullet

916
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,420
Your favors country

917
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,420
Where people clap on the one in the three

918
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,420
They're so rhythmic

919
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,420
We've got the funk

920
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,420
It's in the man, Diana

921
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,420
Who will Greg has got the funk

922
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,420
And we're going to do a couple of TV shows

923
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,420
I probably the last one before the holiday

924
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,420
I wish you came on this show every day

925
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,420
It's so much more fun when you're here

926
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,420
Do you think so?

927
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,420
I love it

928
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,420
My English is not good enough

929
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,420
Yeah, but it would improve overnight

930
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,420
I mean look

931
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,420
Yeah, that's true

932
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
If they offered us a morning television show

933
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,420
Would you say yes?

934
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,420
Okay

935
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,420
I can't even read the

936
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,420
You can't

937
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,420
What?

938
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,420
The teleprompter

939
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,420
Oh God

940
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,420
You don't have to read the teleprompter

941
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,420
You just have to read what they do

942
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,420
They're reading the

943
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,420
I'll do all the reading part

944
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
I'll do all the serious part

945
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,420
You do the vanilla-fudge part

946
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,420
We did a show that everybody did

947
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,420
Like

948
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,420
We did a show that everybody didn't like

949
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,420
I didn't count

950
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,420
That wasn't that wasn't a

951
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
An award show

952
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,420
And so I think we did a very good job

953
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,420
I think the people, all ten people who saw it

954
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,420
Like it

955
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,420
It was crazy

956
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,420
That was a very expensive production

957
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,420
There's no one's no one

958
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,420
A beautiful show

959
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
With lots of great things

960
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,420
Was it like a football game on or something?

961
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,420
I don't know

962
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,420
You got to fuck them

963
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,420
So, of course we got to fuck them

964
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,420
We got to really fuck them

965
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,420
Put us

966
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,420
The story of our life

967
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,420
But we had to present it

968
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,420
And of course you're the professional

969
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,420
And I did everything just from hard

970
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,420
So let me ask you a question

971
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,420
Are you still like in your

972
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,420
Now that you're putting your toe back in the

973
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,420
In the frigid waters of show business

974
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,420
Are you liking it?

975
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,420
Well in a different way

976
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,420
Because you don't give a shit

977
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,420
In a different way

978
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,420
I think I enjoyed more

979
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,420
Because I see you differently

980
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,420
You know

981
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,420
And it's not that I don't think

982
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,420
Let me see

983
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,420
Now I just, yeah I just enjoyed

984
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,420
Because everything that I do now

985
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,420
Is just

986
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,420
You know

987
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,420
Unbelievable

988
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,420
That I still can do it

989
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,420
And especially my age

990
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,420
Let's be honest about it

991
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,420
And that I still can do it

992
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,420
Especially after I've been sick

993
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,420
And thought that I, I was almost dying

994
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,420
So there's nothing that's irritating me

995
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,420
Well I see I don't let it

996
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,420
You don't let it irritate you

997
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,420
I got to check up on you

998
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,420
And make sure that you don't get irritated

999
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,420
I don't

1000
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,420
Nothing irritate you

1001
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,420
It's just that

1002
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,420
I left my head off

1003
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,420
I think it's funny

1004
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,420
And I'm, I'm still standing

1005
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1006
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,420
All right, so what do you do?

1007
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,420
So you have three shows

1008
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,420
I think these one in Blankhamburg and Bergen in Bill

1009
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,420
That's Belgium

1010
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,420
That's a big show

1011
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,420
That's a big show

1012
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,420
That's a big show

1013
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,420
With a whole bunch of different artists

1014
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,420
Who are here

1015
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,420
Okay, that's cool

1016
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,420
And that'll be on what, for what television station

1017
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,420
That's for the VRT

1018
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,420
VRT, isn't it?

1019
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,420
VRT

1020
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,420
Yeah, the Vlamsa

1021
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,420
Glad you're televised

1022
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,420
Televised

1023
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,420
Yeah

1024
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,420
And then I have one for the truss

1025
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,420
Truss

1026
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,420
And I have one for the nuss

1027
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,420
What's the truss?

1028
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,420
Well, you know what

1029
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,420
T-R-O-S

1030
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,420
No, I know, but what is the show?

1031
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,420
Uh, it's like...

1032
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,420
Do you hear the birds?

1033
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,420
Yeah

1034
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,420
You're singing for you

1035
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,420
Yeah, I know

1036
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,420
Why do birds?

1037
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,420
Suddenly a piece

1038
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,420
See that everything is wrong

1039
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,420
Every time

1040
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,420
Everything is a song

1041
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,420
You wanna be

1042
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,420
Every mood that you are in

1043
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,420
Just like me

1044
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,420
They want to be long to be

1045
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,420
They long to be

1046
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,420
Close to you

1047
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,420
On the day that

1048
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,420
You were born

1049
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,420
The angels came together

1050
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,420
And the scientists

1051
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,420
You created dreams come true

1052
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,420
I'm true

1053
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,420
I'm true

1054
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,420
Oh man

1055
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,420
Some dreams

1056
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,420
Yeah, everything is a song

1057
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,420
Everything is a song

1058
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,420
Like monomona

1059
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,420
And also your memories

1060
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,420
Isn't it funny how your memories

1061
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,420
Always sing another song

1062
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,420
Go together with

1063
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,420
I said

1064
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,420
Well, no, no, this is what we call the soundtrack to your life

1065
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,420
Exactly

1066
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,420
And we're creating a new one right here

1067
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,420
And if you hear a song

1068
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,420
You think about

1069
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,420
You see all the

1070
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,420
The movie actually

1071
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,420
Yeah

1072
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
You see the movie

1073
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,420
It's a soundtrack to your life

1074
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,420
Thank you

1075
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
Oh

1076
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,420
That's philosophical

1077
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,420
Well, so

1078
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,420
Yeah, I'm gonna do a couple of TV

1079
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,420
All right, so what kind of show

1080
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,420
You didn't tell me yet

1081
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,420
What kind of show is that

1082
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,420
For tea

1083
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,420
The last one

1084
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,420
And the T.R.O.S.

1085
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,420
Is a whole bunch of

1086
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,420
Idiots

1087
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,420
It is like me

1088
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,420
Still think

1089
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,420
You know, you can really some records

1090
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,420
What is it?

1091
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,420
They'll tell me what's the show

1092
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,420
It's a pop show

1093
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,420
It's a show

1094
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,420
What's the name of the show?

1095
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,420
I don't know, actually

1096
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,420
Hey, dude, I let you on the show

1097
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,420
To promote your shit

1098
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,420
And you

1099
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,420
No, no, no, no, no

1100
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,420
It's just

1101
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,420
Well, who else is on it then?

1102
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,420
Everybody who has anything

1103
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,420
Out at the moment

1104
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,420
Oh, so

1105
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,420
Okay, is it like a one-off show

1106
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,420
So it's a

1107
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,420
You don't know

1108
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,420
It's probably a lot of people in there

1109
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,420
All right, what's the other one?

1110
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,420
Then the other one is about

1111
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,420
Me feel the router

1112
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,420
A famous admiral

1113
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,420
In the Dutch Navy

1114
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,420
In this 1670

1115
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,420
Something like that

1116
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,420
Yeah, yeah

1117
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,420
And that's the me feel

1118
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,420
That out a day

1119
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,420
Mm-hmm

1120
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,420
And you're going to have a lot of

1121
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,420
Ships and boats

1122
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,420
And parades

1123
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,420
Okay, so that's where your

1124
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,420
Marines fit in, right?

1125
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,420
And there

1126
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,420
It's mine

1127
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,420
What's so funny?

1128
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,420
Oh, because you

1129
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,420
You hated

1130
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,420
No, I like the whole Marine thing

1131
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,420
Just, okay

1132
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,420
What do you mean?

1133
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,420
I hate it

1134
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,420
As it's fun, but they think it really suits

1135
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,420
With the real Marines

1136
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,420
All right, a bunch of gay guys running around

1137
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,420
And white suits

1138
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,420
Yeah, we've got the densest with us

1139
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,420
Yeah, that's fun

1140
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,420
Yeah, yeah

1141
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,420
So it's going to be great

1142
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,420
And what's so you're performing on a ship?

1143
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,420
On a

1144
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,420
Fliftex ship

1145
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
An aircraft carrier

1146
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,420
Yeah, really

1147
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,420
Yeah, yeah

1148
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,420
Do the Dutch even have an aircraft carrier

1149
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,420
I guess so

1150
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
Yeah, of course

1151
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,420
Why not?

1152
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,420
I don't know, I've never heard of it

1153
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,420
I've never heard of Dutch having a carrier

1154
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,420
Oh, no, I'll be performing on a ship

1155
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,420
In a zodiac

1156
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,420
In a rubber boat

1157
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,420
Maybe they just push us away on the ocean

1158
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,420
Oh, my gosh

1159
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,420
Oh, my gosh

1160
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,420
Okay, so that sounds like you'll be there the whole week

1161
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,420
It might be a lot of fun

1162
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,420
That means I'm here with the heartbroken teenage

1163
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,420
Yeah, we do

1164
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,420
That's like really

1165
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,420
I don't know what to do with it

1166
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
No, I do

1167
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,420
I'm going to

1168
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,420
I can solve her, I try to make her feel better

1169
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,420
But you know whatever you say

1170
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,420
Doesn't matter

1171
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,420
It doesn't matter

1172
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,420
As long as you're there for them

1173
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,420
I am

1174
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,420
You're there

1175
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,420
I'm here taking care of the whole fucking house

1176
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,420
And you can get some of her car

1177
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,420
You bought it in this car

1178
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,420
Yeah, I hope so

1179
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,420
The weather has to get better

1180
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,420
I'd like to get

1181
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,420
Well, that'll be this week

1182
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,420
And you're not going to tell next week

1183
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,420
So hopefully I can have a visit

1184
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,420
So she's going to be happy with that

1185
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,420
That's going to be very easy

1186
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,420
Yeah, but she can't drive it

1187
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,420
She can look at it

1188
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,420
Yeah

1189
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,420
Yeah, and that's my pink mini

1190
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,420
I'm going to drive around

1191
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,420
Yeah, but I'm going to give her some lessons

1192
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,420
You're in the mountain

1193
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,420
Oh my god

1194
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,420
You might want to find some other place

1195
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,420
Than here in the mountains

1196
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,420
This is not a good idea

1197
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,420
Why not

1198
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,420
The hell is that all about

1199
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,420
I'm a great driver

1200
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,420
No, no, you just want to find a spot where there's no traffic

1201
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,420
Yeah, I know then

1202
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,420
At the end of the end of Gulfert

1203
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,420
I know where that is

1204
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,420
Going to go

1205
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,420
This doesn't

1206
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,420
I mean, why don't we just let it go to professional lessons

1207
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,420
Yeah, this is not a good idea

1208
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,420
Of course, she's going to have professional lessons

1209
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,420
Of course

1210
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,420
Somehow even though I know that I couldn't pass up the opportunity

1211
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,420
For getting this beautiful car

1212
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,420
It's a bad idea to have

1213
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,420
Why did you say yes anyway

1214
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,420
Because I'm a sucker

1215
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,420
Yeah, no, it's like you'll never find it

1216
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,420
It's perfect

1217
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,420
You'll never find a crime

1218
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,420
Did you tell the listeners?

1219
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,420
Oh, yes many times

1220
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,420
It's pink, of course

1221
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,420
Yeah, no, it's as cute as button

1222
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,420
You know, it's like

1223
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,420
You just will not find a car like that

1224
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,420
But to have it before she has her license

1225
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,420
And have it sitting in the car

1226
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,420
We have this kind of cruel

1227
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,420
We have to sort of take two pictures

1228
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,420
Put them together

1229
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,420
Yeah

1230
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,420
That is Christina

1231
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,420
When she was four years old in her

1232
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,420
Oh, and her pink carpet

1233
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,420
Her pink carpet

1234
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,420
And then pink

1235
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,420
Isn't it fantastic?

1236
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,420
Dude, you live in such a

1237
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,420
Fucking 1950s white-picked fence world

1238
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,420
Don't you?

1239
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,420
Well

1240
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,420
What the

1241
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,420
Yeah

1242
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,420
Yeah

1243
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,420
Yeah, that's it

1244
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,420
Yeah, that's it

1245
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,420
Yeah, that's it

1246
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,420
Yeah, that's it

1247
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,420
Well, play one more song

1248
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,420
Get out of here

1249
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,420
This one's good on Monday, but two days are fine

1250
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,420
We thought you'd do a big boom

1251
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,420
But two months are on show

1252
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,420
Oh

1253
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,420
Pretty much so

1254
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,420
Taken to you women

1255
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,420
Damn the day

1256
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,420
I really want to buy a gun

1257
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,420
Every night to change

1258
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,420
And to me

1259
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,420
Do you really just like I do

1260
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,420
You just will smile

1261
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,420
She says it's because you're right

1262
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,420
With you

1263
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,420
Two days

1264
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,420
Five bardzo

1265
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,420
One day

1266
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:05,920
Seven

1267
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,420
Two days

1268
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,420
Five foot

1269
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,420
One day

1270
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:21,420
Five clapping

1271
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,420
Sparing Waves

1272
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,420
Two days

1273
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,420
Six and Two

1274
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:26,740
And then in a

1275
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,420
So many

1276
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,420
Seven

1277
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,460
Two

1278
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,460
I hate the way it's said, and I don't know why

1279
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,460
I never did stop but never knew about you, I don't mind

1280
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:44,460
Never really thought to knew people, but I thought you might like to know

1281
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:50,460
Never really thought to knew people, but to my sorrow, shall I?

1282
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,460
Two days, fine and with me, say

1283
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,460
Say it over into things, fine and with me, say

1284
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:06,460
Say it over into things, fine and with me

1285
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,460
Say it over into things, fine and with me, say

1286
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:37,460
Say it over into things, fine and with me, say

Say it over into things, fine and with me, say

1289
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:58,460
Five, six, five with me.

1290
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,460
Fire it, choose this fine.

1291
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,460
This summer, when you buy Coke, you get music.

1292
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,460
You can win an iPod or Freaksongs on iTunes.

1293
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,460
So you just like a real show.

1294
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,460
I got commercials and everything.

1295
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,460
Cool.

1296
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,460
Alright, baby, hey, almost 48, four, yeah, almost 49 minutes.

1297
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,460
So I'm wishing you can end this.

1298
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,460
I think I've got a pullback now, because the people have had enough of you for that.

1299
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,460
Oh, I think so, yeah, overdue.

1300
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,460
All right.

1301
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,460
Send the woman away.

1302
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,460
Well, you know how much I enjoy it when you come on the show.

1303
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,460
Well, thank you, Han.

1304
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,460
That's very sweet of you.

1305
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,460
So please come back anytime.

1306
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,460
Really?

1307
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,460
Even this week, if you're thinking, I'll look at the poor boy struggling to put the show together.

1308
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,460
Maybe she goes stairs and hit her with a little dude.

1309
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,460
Well, I didn't put a smile on your face, huh?

1310
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,460
Yes.

1311
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,460
Last night as well.

1312
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,460
Let's see.

1313
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,460
Put a smile on my knob.

1314
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,460
I'm not a puke.

1315
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,460
Yeah, really?

1316
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,460
Yeah.

1317
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,460
Okay.

1318
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,460
So what are you going to do?

1319
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,460
You out?

1320
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,460
You going to do something today?

1321
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,460
Uh, yeah.

1322
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,460
Get some groceries.

1323
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,460
Okay.

1324
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,460
Cool.

1325
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,460
Yeah.

1326
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,460
I think I'm going to make some Italian food.

1327
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,460
Oh, yeah.

1328
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,460
It's very hot.

1329
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,460
It's what I want to.

1330
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,460
Maybe a nice spaghetti with my beautiful.

1331
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,460
Oh.

1332
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,460
Oh, yes.

1333
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,460
Oh, I really need you.

1334
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,460
I need that.

1335
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,460
What's your secret ingredient?

1336
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,460
I'm going to tell you.

1337
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,460
You put, uh, you do put everything sugar in the sauce.

1338
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,460
And everything.

1339
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,460
And it's a scoop of sugar.

1340
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,460
Lots of garlic and lots of fresh basil.

1341
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,460
And a little bit of oregano and a bit of tears and a bit of that.

1342
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,460
A little bit of love.

1343
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,460
Lots of love.

1344
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,460
Okay.

1345
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,460
No, I don't think you're so much for being on the show.

1346
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,460
I thank you for having me.

1347
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,460
And I know my listeners thank you too.

1348
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,460
And they're your listeners too.

1349
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,460
I hope so.

1350
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,460
Thank you so much.

1351
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,460
Okay.

00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,460
Oh, and if you want to download the stars.

1354
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,460
Oh, you have a hive's account.

1355
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,460
Which is in people there.

1356
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,460
Yeah.

1357
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,460
Well, the Dutch, of course.

1358
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,460
No, no, no.

1359
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,460
This thing is version.

1360
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,460
Oh, yes.

1361
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,460
It's completely in my space.

1362
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,460
Okay.

1363
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,460

A new CD single is star sisters, proud to present a 2007.

And we know that's part safe.

I mean, it's still being played.

1372

Yeah.

1373
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,460
So, you know, we need it.

00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,460
I'm such a lucky woman.

1383
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,460
What was that?

1384
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,460
The pod show radio?

1385
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,460
Yeah.
