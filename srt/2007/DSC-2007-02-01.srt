1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
You're Tony, what are you doing?

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,520
Well, you're listening to the DSC 537.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,360
Why you pushing that button, Tony?

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,280
Well, you'll Adam always plays a commercial and then he plays a goofy intro and then he

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,760
plays some music, so I'm fast forward and to I can get to Adam talk it.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,920
You know, Tony, you can't fast forward to hear Adam talk and you're missing a good

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
ad.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
There might be something in there you can use.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,320
There might be an offer that you can use, like GoDaddy, you can host your own website.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
Yeah, I was going to look and see if Tony puts you really dot com as available, maybe

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,480
I'll go to GoDaddy and register that one.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,200
And besides, Tony, if you skip the goofy intro for DSC 537, you'd miss us.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,080
Oh, I didn't think about that way.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,440
Man, this whole time shift and things has got me crazy, I don't understand it.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,080
So, Tony, no more fast forwarding to begin another show, Capiche?

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
Capiche.

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,760
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,760
content in my ears.

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,440
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:27,080
Made out of town in a small cafe, she had the motion of the ocean out her hips this

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,480
way, she had everybody looking back and everybody took him back and anything, she wanted

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,000
all the guys on the day now.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
She won.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,200
I'm fine, folks, we'll keep losing her.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
She's not.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Tough Tony, cuz she knows she got it and she got it and she got it and she got it.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,920
Comments and tights and can't expect to make a man, but where we still I get everything

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,920
is okay, she got it and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,920
and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,920
and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,920
and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,920
and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got it and she got

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,920
he goes you down but when you meet up her.

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:40,920
She'll keep it and she reflects that she Porsche look and she got everything

35
00:02:40,920 --> 00:03:10,920
And I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again

36
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:40,920
again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I will take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll take all this again, and I'll take all over again, and I'll

37
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,920
She got tricks and she got some treats, she's taking the ground on the meat, you knock it off your feet

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,920
She did everything about her for my head, I don't know if I'll make rules or melodies and sounds of music when she speaks now

39
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:01,920
She's done, consistent with the energy, and she put them in the wings when it's time to play

40
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,920
She's like a fun, it's not for wanting just a whiff or a mental makin' needs, get me sick

41
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Wow!

42
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:30,920
You can find them feature today at the PodSafe Music Network, I don't know if they're at least the

43
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,920
That's on the UK version of PodSho.com, BT PodSho.com

44
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Black Alicious Powers!

45
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
It's interesting!

46
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,920
I'm always cruising around the network seeing what we're promoting and wondering sometimes why we're promoting things

47
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Wow!

48
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,920
The craft!

49
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,920
And I'm looking at Black Alicious, so I go over to the podcaster side of the PodSafe Music Network

50
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:02,920
And I see that these two tracks they have up there were uploaded in 2005, I'm like, why are we promoting this guys?

51
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,920
And the only thing I can ask, obviously, the only reason I can come up with is that it's Black History Month, perhaps?

52
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,920
Maybe Black Alicious Powers, Black History Month, something like that, I gotta find out why.

53
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Because I'd much rather be promoting people who are putting up new stuff and are with the program, no I'm saying it's 2007.

54
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Hey everybody!

55
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Welcome to Daily Source Code, Delta Sierra Charity 537.

56
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,920
I will tell you right up front, I'm in a foul mood today.

57
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:34,920
It all started last night, David the Sky Guy, who turns out to be a fantastic guy.

58
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,920
He's an independent contractor, you know, Sky call.

59
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,920
It's not the guy, by the way, who said he couldn't find my house.

60
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I guess they figured out that was not the right guy to be sending around to me.

61
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Really nice guy.

62
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Very well mannered, you know, new a lot.

63
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,920
I've lived in the States actually in Chicago and in...

64
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
What's he live?

65
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Asbury Park, New Jersey.

66
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Asbury Park in the UK, 10 or 11 years, just moved down from Leeds.

67
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,920
He's been in Guilford for about three or four weeks, has his own company.

68
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
And he really, really went all out.

69
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
And we had three boxes to be installed.

70
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Big holes to be drilled in the walls.

71
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,920
You know, wiring that had to be worked out, you know, nicely and kind of hidden if at all possible.

72
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
And that was great.

73
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,920
And even better, I'd have to say, as he said, after we were on the phone with Sky HQ,

74
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,920
getting the cards sorted out, the satellite viewing cards more on that in just a second.

75
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Because that's where my shagrin started.

76
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,920
He's like, hey man, can you mind if I ask you, what are you smoking?

77
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I'm like, well, unfortunately it's like some fucking melted CDs that's being passed off

78
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,920
as what they call solid here in the UK.

79
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
I said, I know it.

80
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
It's like melted CDs.

81
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
I can tell.

82
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
It's not doing much.

83
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,920
But besides probably killing me and giving me severe diseases.

84
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,920
He says, oh, man, you know, would you like some home ground?

85
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,920
I'm like, okay, he's my man.

86
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,920
And yeah, so we drank a beer all the way in for a second.

87
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
And this is when it all happened.

88
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,920
So I have three cards and because the, you know, I don't want to get all the way into it,

89
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
because I'm just going to riled up again.

90
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,920
But because the first installer said he couldn't find my house.

91
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
He canceled the job.

92
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
My cards got canceled.

93
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,920
All these fucked up things happened.

94
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,920
And so I have three cards of which only one works.

95
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,920
And but here's the thing that really, really, really piss me off.

96
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:27,920
So they charged me 10 pounds to reactivate one, sending me out a new one for a secondary or

97
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,920
tertiary box because that card was damaged or whatever.

98
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,920
And what they done is they can, like, I'm watching for like 30 minutes.

99
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
And then all of a sudden, your card is not authorized.

100
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
So I go through the whole thing again.

101
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Every single time they will forward you to someone else.

102
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
And you have to explain, you know, hi.

103
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
How can I help you?

104
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
What's your name?

105
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
What's your phone number?

106
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
What's your address?

107
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
What's your title?

108
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
What's your title?

109
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Well, we're talking about fucking title.

110
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Pod father, you asshole?

111
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Oh, Mr. Yeah, Mr. Adam Curry.

112
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
That's it.

113
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,920
And, you know, so you go through that a couple times and you have to explain the whole situation again.

114
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,920
And all the notes on the account are now completely fucked up.

115
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,920
So I'm like, okay, you know, look, I have this card.

116
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Here's the card number.

117
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
That card doesn't exist.

118
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Well, no, it does because I have it in my hands.

119
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
I've had it for two years.

120
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
No, that card does not exist.

121
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Where did you get that card?

122
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
And that's where I really get angry.

123
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
At the, when did you get that card?

124
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Because I know, particularly, you know, the satellite viewing cards.

125
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,920
That's really the satellite television industry's version of DRM.

126
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,920
You know, and there's a huge black market in so-called gold cards.

127
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,920
So you can, you know, and these are just basically jacked in every month or periodically.

128
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,920
The satellite broadcasters will send down some kind of bullet through the line.

129
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,920
It'll blow up the card if you, if you haven't even a quote, illegal card.

130
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
So this card is probably now blown up as well.

131
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,920
But, you know, so they, I guess they removed it from their system.

132
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,920
But the accusation, the accusation will tone.

133
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Where did you get this card?

134
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Yeah, I like, you know, maybe speak to a supervisor.

135
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
That's where it gets really interesting.

136
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Why?

137
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Because, you know, I can yell at you.

138
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,920
You know, and you probably are just following the script.

139
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
And I'm happy to do that.

140
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Or you can give me a supervisor.

141
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
And I can really give him a piece of my mind.

142
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,920
And then, you know, you get put on hold for ten minutes.

143
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
Well, there's no supervisor available.

144
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Said, go look again.

145
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,920
You know, and then it's like, well, this, this is not warranted for a super, whatever.

146
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
You know, whatever.

147
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Just like fuck you.

148
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Fuck you.

149
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Send me the fucking fuck you.

150
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Well, that's what I thought.

151
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,920
I didn't actually say it because I know they can't help it.

152
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,920
But it's just the whole culture of that of sky as a company.

153
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,920
It's a bunch of dickheads.

154
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Okay.

155
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,920
So we have one card that we now have to swap around and move throughout the house.

156
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
And I guess they're sending new cards.

157
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,920
The good news is I made a new friend with David this guy, man.

158
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
He's a very cool guy.

159
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,920
And what I'm going to have him do is actually help me build the entire media room.

160
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,920
So I'm, I've actually canceled the, the H.D.

161
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Wide screen that I had on order.

162
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Because I want to make sure I get all the right stuff.

163
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
And we want to get the game console set up.

164
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,920
The karaoke's got to be, the karaoke's got to be set up.

165
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Everything.

166
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
You know, I want to, we, I want the whole, the whole,

167
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,920
the, we by the way with safe guards.

168
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,920
So, you know, my teenage daughter doesn't throw a controller through the screen.

169
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Which is also the second part of why it's so exasperated and a bit in the film.

170
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Move today.

171
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,920
You know, we have this, I got two girls in the house, man.

172
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
I got my wife and I have the neighbor.

173
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
And that's my daughter.

174
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,920
And then they're closed fit each other.

175
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,920
So there's always something about the clothes and Christina takes clothes without asking.

176
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
And then she, you know, she borrows this.

177
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,920
And then, oh, no, I left it at cat's house or just has it.

178
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,920
You know, and I'm just like, I get so, I'm like, dude, you know,

179
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
you don't have to do jack shit here.

180
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,920
You don't, you know, you don't have to, you know,

181
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
do you have teenagers?

182
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Do you go through this?

183
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
It's like you're living here rent free.

184
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
You got internet.

185
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,920
You got a satellite television.

186
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Your boyfriend is welcome to come by anytime and have

187
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,920
dinner and by the way, you know,

188
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Patricia will be taking dinner out of the oven and the door

189
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
will bill will ring.

190
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
I mean, and Andy's a great guy.

191
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,920
You know, he, he works after school every single day for several hours

192
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
cleaning office buildings, I think.

193
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
So, and it's within like a 20 minute walk from our house.

194
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
It's fine.

195
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
You know, it's totally cool.

196
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,920
But I want a little bit of respect from the teenager as

197
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
really pissing me off.

198
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,920
And, you know, so I'm not quite sure how.

199
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,920
I'm going to deal with it, but just,

200
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
sometimes, you know, you love him to death,

201
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,920
but sometimes you just want to stick him up behind the wall

202
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
paper.

203
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Adam, Bill from Virginia,

204
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
just driving into work,

205
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
listen to DSC 535,

206
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,920
and haven't listened to all things into about 12 minutes

207
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
and you're commenting on your sound issues,

208
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
so I was so forth.

209
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Just as you're working through those problems,

210
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
also play attention to the levels between

211
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
your voiceover, so on and so forth.

212
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
And the voice nails,

213
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
the voice nails are much lower level,

214
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
you know, turn up your volume,

215
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
and then you come back on.

216
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,920
And of course, your ears get a little flowed out.

217
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
So, anyhow, if there's anything you can do

218
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
to balance that out in process,

219
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
that would be appreciated.

220
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Thank you.

221
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Yeah, I've received a couple of those.

222
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,920
I hope this is better now.

223
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,920
I've done some more configuration, some tweaking.

224
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Is it possible?

225
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
I don't know how long do the tubes last

226
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,920
on a stereo valve processor?

227
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Why am I hearing now?

228
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Because I think the tubes are going.

229
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,920
And this thing has been almost on 24,

230
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
seven, when did I buy it?

231
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Like two years ago, when we first moved here,

232
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
so it's almost been on 24, seven.

233
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
And I think, because once in a while,

234
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
it's like one of the channels,

235
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
it sounds like it's crackling,

236
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
and then you blow into the microphone,

237
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
then it clears up.

238
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
If anyone has any ideas on that,

239
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
and of course, then I'm going to have to go and have it serviced,

240
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
or so I've done a little bit of tweaking.

241
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
The big problem is,

242
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,920
there are so many different levels,

243
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
and yeah, you can pump it all through a limiter

244
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
and a compressor,

245
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,920
but that really starts to mush with the sound.

246
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
And since I'm working with Casplaster,

247
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
it's really only one channel,

248
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,920
so you can't have like a different channel

249
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,920
for just audio comments or for softer bass content.

250
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,920
So hopefully it's a little bit better now,

251
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
than I know,

252
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,920
there's lots of people that your drums are getting blown out,

253
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
turning up the audio comments,

254
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
so it should be better.

255
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Let me know.

256
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
So this is now,

257
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
it's official, it's the curry manner.

258
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
It's sticking,

259
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
although Casey Murl did say,

260
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
how about the curry condom,

261
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
because it keeps you and your family members protected

262
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,920
from people like Roger Smalls and comic strip blogger.

263
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Oh, yes.

264
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,920
You know, this is a brand new show

265
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,920
that joined the Pot Show podcast network bucket.

266
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
And today,

267
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
we have not won,

268
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,920
but two comments from the buckets.

269
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,920
And I think that sounds from Jen.

270
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
She picks up on a thread

271
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
that we've been talking about for a couple days now.

272
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
Hi, Adam.

273
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,920
This is Jen from Bucket.

274
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,920
And I was just giving you a comment

275
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,920
to weigh in on this posh people and patties.

276
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
And this is right up my alley.

277
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
So you know,

278
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
I just had to send you a comment.

279
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
I believe the question was,

280
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
are posh people potty pigs?

281
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Really getting off on all the peas here.

282
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Anyway,

283
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
I just wanted to let you know

284
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
that I definitely believe that

285
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,920
bad potty behavior is not limited to the rich.

286
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Believe me.

287
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,920
I work in an enormous government building.

288
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
And the things that I see every day

289
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
would just turn your stomach.

290
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
You just wouldn't believe.

291
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,920
You just wouldn't believe that

292
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
any in on the seat,

293
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
drop in toilet paper on the floor.

294
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
All manner of horrible things.

295
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
Everything that that person saw in their posh bathroom,

296
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,920
I have seen it in spades in the bourgeois bathroom

297
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
that is in my building.

298
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,920
So I do not believe that posh people are potty pigs.

299
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
I believe that we all are people

300
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
have disgusting bathroom habits.

301
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
Anyway,

302
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
I talk about this kind of stuff every week

303
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
on our show bucket at bucket.ponshow.com.

304
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
So I just couldn't resist weighing in

305
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
all the time.

306
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Thank you, my dear.

307
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,920
And welcome to the family.

308
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,920
I liked all the peas, by the way.

309
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Our posh people potty pigs.

310
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
There you go.

311
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
Posh people potty pigs.

312
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
You know,

313
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
I think we're on to something here

314
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
that apparently,

315
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
and you know,

316
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
you go to anyone's house.

317
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,920
I guarantee the people who are pigs in your posh potty

318
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
or not.

319
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
They're bathrooms nice and clean.

320
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
What is it?

321
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Why do people behave

322
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
that way?

323
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
It is unimaginable.

324
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
And is this something cultural

325
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
to the United States?

326
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,920
To the United Kingdom?

327
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,920
How about Asia?

328
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
You know,

329
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
you may think I'm obsessed with

330
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
with bathroom stuff,

331
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,920
but it is kind of interesting

332
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
that we do this.

333
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Dan,

334
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
It can get really, really bad,

335
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
you know?

336
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Hey, Adam Ruster,

337
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
from the Bruinsport podcast here.

338
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,920
I was just listening to the DSE536.

339
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
In hearing,

340
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
I was just listening to some of the situations

341
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
he encountered while

342
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
ginging out on weekends with his band

343
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
and some of the nasty situations he found

344
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
and some bathrooms.

345
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Well, unfortunately,

346
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
it may be think a little bit too much of a situation

347
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,920
that we've actually been having in the workplace as well.

348
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
And,

349
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
well,

350
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
I better describe it and you can go from there.

351
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,920
And this is kind of relate to the posh

352
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
piggies in the potty,

353
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
I guess you can call it.

354
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Now,

355
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,920
the building network in is a very nice building,

356
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,920
especially by a lot of businesses that dare,

357
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
I would say on the professional level,

358
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
my company is a data carrier.

359
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
There are other service-related

360
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
and new-and-service agencies in our building.

361
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,920
And every single floor has its own public shared bathroom

362
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
with all the businesses used together.

363
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Well,

364
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
our bathroom on the second floor,

365
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
unfortunately,

366
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
tends to get visited a lot by

367
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
the fans of the shit.

368
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
That's right.

369
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
The fans of the shit are used

370
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
in a dubbed.

371
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Essentially,

372
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
somebody who works at one of the companies on our floor

373
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,920
apparently has some problems aiming.

374
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Now,

375
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
most men,

376
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
sometimes have problems aiming while standing up.

377
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Well,

378
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
apparently the fans of the shitter has problems aiming

379
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
while sitting down.

380
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
On a good day,

381
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,920
he only gets shit on the top part of the toilet seat.

382
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
The bottom part.

383
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
On a bad day,

384
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,920
it's down the sides of the toilet.

385
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
It's on the tank of the toilet.

386
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
And if you're really lucky,

387
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,920
you get to walk into the stall where the shit is on the wall.

388
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
That's right.

389
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
And really bothers me,

390
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
and a lot of the guys that I work with,

391
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
because we're all professionals.

392
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
We're all adults.

393
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
We all like to take care of ourselves.

394
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
We all like to have this take care of themselves as well.

395
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,920
And to see this nastiness in the bathroom,

396
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
at least twice a week,

397
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
is disgusting.

398
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
And unfortunately,

399
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
at least a lot of sideways glances too.

400
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
I'm in the bathroom finishing up.

401
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
I'm washing my hands and there's another gentleman

402
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
from another business down the hall.

403
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Kind of looking at me sideways.

404
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
And I feel like I have to defend myself.

405
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Look at me.

406
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,920
I'm washing my hands.

407
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Look at the stall.

408
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
I was just in.

409
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
It's clean.

410
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
I'm not the phantom shitter.

411
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Somebody else is,

412
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
but it's not me.

413
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,920
And one of the really disgusting things to think of

414
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
is that some gentleman is walking in,

415
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
taking a seat,

416
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,920
and just letting it go everywhere.

417
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
And when you look at the mess that's left behind,

418
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,920
you have to think to yourself,

419
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
if this is the mess he's living in the bathroom,

420
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,920
is he cleaning himself up as well?

421
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Or is he just letting that go too?

422
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
It's really tough situation.

423
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,920
The custodians in the building are really trying to figure out

424
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,920
what they can do to try and stop this perpetrator,

425
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,920
the poopy perpetrator, I guess you can call him.

426
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Unfortunately until then,

427
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
he's just going to keep on shitting and after he's praying

428
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
that I don't have any clients coming for a visit

429
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
and using that stall that he knew just vacated

430
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
because if they do,

431
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
I've got to say,

432
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,920
the shit is really going to hit the fan at that point.

433
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Take care, Adam.

434
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Dude.

435
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
You know,

436
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
if that was happening in our building,

437
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
I would have frickin' stake out going on.

438
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,920
I would have people stake out watching everyone

439
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
who comes in and out of the men's room

440
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,920
and checking right after someone leaves.

441
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
You better believe it.

442
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
You got to bust this guy.

443
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
That is just the lowest of the...

444
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,920
It sounds like he's doing a hovering job there

445
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,920
and he's not doing a very good job of it.

446
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,920
But what is it?

447
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
What is it?

448
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
With the bathroom.

449
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
Public toilets.

450
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Why can't we keep them clean?

451
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
It just doesn't make sense to me.

452
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,920
I'd love to hear from some Eastern cultures.

453
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Hey, you guys down under in Australia.

454
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
At the help desk.

455
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
How's your bathroom?

456
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Is it also...

457
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,920
P-pigged up by potty pigs?

458
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,920
It's just unbelievable to me.

459
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Oh, we're on the political correctness tip.

460
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Whitney Hoffman from the LD podcast sent me an email

461
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
said,

462
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
listening to your comments about the Netherlands reality show

463
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
featuring people with physical disabilities.

464
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Both Jen from Bucket and you use the term handicapped several times.

465
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,920
I just want to let you know why the term disabled or disability

466
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,920
is usually preferred.

467
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Oh, so here's the history lesson.

468
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Oh, I should go...

469
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
Besides the podcasting, I'm an attorney

470
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,920
and if help businesses and clients with disability access

471
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
issues under the Americans with disabilities act

472
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
for slightly over eight years.

473
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
Okay.

474
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,920
No, I appreciate the fact that you're a lawyer.

475
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
Here's interesting.

476
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
The term handicapped.

477
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,920
And that's where some controversy about this comes in.

478
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Comes from the fact that people with disabilities

479
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,920
were often seen begging on the street with,

480
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
quote,

481
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
cap in hand.

482
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
Hence handicapped.

483
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Oh, that's interesting.

484
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,920
So there's lots of links about it.

485
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Please don't get into the debate of whether it's an urban legend

486
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,920
or where that came from.

487
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,920
But okay, I will do my best if that's what you want.

488
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
No problem.

489
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
I wish people would give me the same respect.

490
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Some of the names people have called me.

491
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
I've been a little bit worse than handicapped.

492
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
I'll tell you that.

493
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
But that makes sense.

494
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Absolutely.

495
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,920
I got something really cool for you guys.

496
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,920
You'll find a link to it on

497
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
dailysourcecode.com in the show notes.

498
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
If you're a Mac user,

499
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
you're going to love this little widget.

500
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Hey, Adam.

501
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,920
It's Scott from Top Dead Center

502
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,920
and Weekly Breeze and Corporate Cluster.

503
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Just wanted to drop you a line.

504
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
I decided to go ahead and start making

505
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,920
Mac OS 10 dashboard widgets for any podcaster

506
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,920
that wants to have a podcast player

507
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,920
widget of their own for their podcast or

508
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
what they can do is put it on their website.

509
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,920
And they can let any of their listeners

510
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,920
download it and install it on their Mac.

511
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,920
And you just drag it in and it automatically

512
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,920
loads up their XML file, their feed.

513
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,920
And you can just press play.

514
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
And it plays their most recent podcast

515
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
or you can actually click on the drop down menu

516
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,920
and go and listen to any past episodes.

517
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
It's pretty cool.

518
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
And only cost 10 bucks.

519
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
How about that?

520
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Go to top, dead, center, podcast.com.

521
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
That's my website.

522
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,920
And click on the button up at the top that says

523
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
podcast widget.

524
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
That's about it.

525
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Thanks again.

526
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Oh, I'm glad that you thought that the trailer

527
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,920
idea for Trinity was was pretty good.

528
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
You know, I'm one of those people that I get

529
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,920
I get one or two good ideas a year.

530
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
And well, you got one.

531
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,920
So I'll talk to you later, dude.

532
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
By the way, folder.

533
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Yeah, of course.

534
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
I expected no less.

535
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Yeah, I got news about the Trinity trailer

536
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
hitch coming up.

537
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Of course, an update on free Trinity.

538
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,920
So this widget is very nice to look at.

539
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
And it's a very simplistic idea.

540
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
I think Dawn and Drew have one as well.

541
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
So now you can buy your own for 10 bucks.

542
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,920
And you can hand it out unlimitedly,

543
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
which I think is a tremendous deal.

544
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Now, as I was looking at this thing,

545
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
I'm thinking to myself, well, this is kind of interesting

546
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,920
because, and by the way, I think that widgets do have a future.

547
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
I love confabulator.

548
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,920
And of course, Apple came out with the OSX OS 10 widgets.

549
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,920
And there's a version of widgets for Vista, I think,

550
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
and who knows.

551
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
I mean, there's all kinds of different widgets.

552
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
And developers love creating these things.

553
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Because they deliver one very defined piece of functionality,

554
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
and it's fun.

555
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,920
And I don't like the dashboard necessarily on OS 10

556
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,920
because, you know, it basically puts a whole layer over the stuff

557
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
that I'm doing.

558
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
I want to be able to interact with stuff while it's right there,

559
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,920
and not while all the other widgets have to appear.

560
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,920
So that's neither here nor there, because it does work very well.

561
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,920
I'm thinking, this will be great for channels.

562
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
I had, you know, I have an on-the-go channel,

563
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,920
which I listen to, I listen to it on a number of devices,

564
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,920
because it's basically an RSS feed that is dynamically updated,

565
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,920
based upon a number of shows that I'm subscribed to.

566
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,920
So, one if we expose, and the engineers at pod show

567
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,920
are listening to the show, so take notes, guys.

568
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
Pull over to the side of the road,

569
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,920
and write this one down, because here's an idea, which I think is going to

570
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,920
really be fun, fun to play with.

571
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,920
If you're listening to serious stars 102, you don't get that fun.

572
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,920
Because my satellite window is closing, you can hear it kind of sliding down

573
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,920
and creaking his p-dubbs about to move on to the next show.

574
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,920
So, I'll talk to you guys tomorrow for Fubar Friday.

575
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:37,920
So, what if we expose an API, which is essentially an application programming interface,

576
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,920
a way for other programs to talk to the pod show platform,

577
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,920
that enabled you to supply a set of credentials,

578
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,920
so username and password, and then it would populate,

579
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,920
or it would basically send back an OPML file with all of the channels.

580
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,920
And each channel that you've created on pod show plus

581
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,920
is, of course, an RSS feed, so you can select from that.

582
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,920
So, by the way, you know, just talking about this widget,

583
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,920
that's a widget I would really love to have.

584
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,920
So, I could just acquire this widget,

585
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,920
and then say, okay, log me into my pod show account,

586
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,920
boom, it would show me all of my channels,

587
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
and then I can just say, okay, I want to listen to this channel,

588
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,920
and I just start to playing that channel.

589
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,920
And that would be a really, really cool widget to have.

590
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,920
So, you've heard it here.

591
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,920
I'm putting in my work order.

592
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,920
I really want to have this API exposed,

593
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,920
because I think a lot of people could do a lot of fun stuff with it.

594
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
Let's see.

595
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,920
You know, it's going to be a long show.

596
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,920
I'm going to skip a couple things here, but I cannot skip this.

597
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:57,920
That's gonna be a big summit.

598
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,920
I can't, man.

599
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
You thought the GA was a big deal.

600
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,920
You thought the devote was a big deal,

601
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
ah, ah.

602
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
I'm sorry.

603
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,920
The 8th of February 2007,

604
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
that's going to be the big summit.

605
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,920
I can't mandate it Tuesday.

606
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:25,480
And on Wednesday, next week there is no airplane from here, so I can only say today, Friday or Saturday next week.

607
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:33,720
If Thursday, 7th February is fine with you, then please let me know SAP and I will come,

608
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,440
but be 100% sure that you can.

609
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,920
Regarding video, of course surely you can do it and bring some gas.

610
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:50,920
I think he meant the 8th Thursday is the 8th, so 2 o'clock Thursday the 8th February, 2007.

611
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,920
Comикster Blogger and I are going to meet up, he is going to interview me.

612
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,920
I'm allowed to bring a long video camera, he wants me to bring along some girls.

613
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Dude, I don't know what to say to that.

614
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,920
So this will be a very historic meeting, and I have to say anticipation is building him.

615
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
I'm getting quite excited about it.

616
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,920
I've been playing more and more with that Nokia and 800 that I was given.

617
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:21,920
And I got to tell you, I'm really, which says I'm getting motivated to do some stuff.

618
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:30,920
I installed the X-term application and low on behold, you start this up and then you've got a command line.

619
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,920
You've got a Linux command line and you've got a shell.

620
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,920
And I'm quite familiar with the Unix shell and I've done lots of shell scripting in my time.

621
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,920
And some of it, if I want to test a network, I'm always open up a terminal window.

622
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,920
I want to ping something, I want to trace route, but also I like using WGAT and stuff like that.

623
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,920
There's a lot of things you can do, it's very, very functional, not a great, not a great fantastic graphical user interface.

624
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
But that's why I like Gmail.

625
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,920
I like using keyboard commands, I think the mouse is in many cases a waste of time.

626
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,920
And I'm thinking about, you know, I saw that there was Python is available for the device.

627
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,920
I'm thinking, well, why wouldn't I install Python?

628
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,920
And of course, it's a real, real geeky thing to do.

629
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:24,920
But if I installed Python, then I could easily install a Python version of, I think there's still an iPodder or maybe there's a juice version.

630
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,920
But I know there's a Python pod catcher somewhere.

631
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:35,920
And because this little box is so good, it's finding open Wi-Fi networks.

632
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,920
And I know this because there is a little feed reader that's built into it.

633
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,920
And the thing's always updated, you know, it updates every 30 minutes and whether it's connecting through an open,

634
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:50,920
an open Wi-Fi access point or through Bluetooth to the GSM that's in my pocket, it's always updated.

635
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,920
And I think this would be pretty much the iPod I want to have.

636
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,920
You know, and by the way, it has a great phone jack and a speaker, a earphone jack and a speakers,

637
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,920
you know, the player is reasonably advanced.

638
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,920
Wouldn't it be fantastic to just be walking around and whenever something new pops up,

639
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,920
if it has a network available or to wait until the network is there, it's going to start downloading.

640
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,920
And you basically just have your stuff all the time.

641
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,920
I really think that this will be one of the first.

642
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,920
And there was the arcos, the arcos, arcos, arcos, arcos, whatever it was.

643
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,920
I don't know what the problem is with that because I thought that was also Linux based and it's no one's developing.

644
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,920
But this thing has a battery life, it's just not to be believed.

645
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,920
I mean, I use it the whole day long until basically until I go to bed at night,

646
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:44,920
I haven't taken my laptop downstairs once since we've been here, just been using the tablet because now that I've got it figured out,

647
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,920
you can use full Gmail, it can do everything except really any type of office documents,

648
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,920
which we don't use a lot of at Podge, I think we use a lot of Google docs.

649
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:59,920
And by the way, that doesn't work in the opera browser on Linux, unfortunately.

650
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,920
But you can always view something as HTML in Google Mail just to get the idea.

651
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,920
But I'm really excited about it.

652
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,920
If I had a little bit more time, I guarantee you I'd be working on this.

653
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:20,920
And also, it's got VNC, servers, and viewers, and one of these days when I have some time, I'll really get it into it.

654
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:26,920
I add them, it's you from Ferrox, glad to hear you're back in the UK and everything's okay.

655
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Starting here outside the hangar, looking at the dust Sierra, looking very sad.

656
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,920
It's a beautiful sunny day today, and she's inside and all the lucky airplanes are outside.

657
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,920
Difficult to look at on me at the end of the hangar.

658
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,920
If you come down this way to fly, you've got the sincere going and things,

659
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
and you've got to come and have a look at this waiter.

660
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,920
There's now part just near your aircraft.

661
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,920
It is gorgeous.

662
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
What is it, a waiter, is that what he said?

663
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,920
I can't wait to, you know, Captain Dan called yesterday, I haven't spoken to him.

664
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,920
But I think I just need to go flying this weekend.

665
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,920
You know, usually I'm a guy that won't go flying unless I actually have to go somewhere,

666
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,920
or I've planned to go somewhere.

667
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,920
I don't really just fly around and do stuff.

668
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,920
But it's been, what, six weeks at least.

669
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Maybe even longer since I've flown with that bad weather.

670
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
I've been away.

671
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,920
You just heard from you, the plane is really sad.

672
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Yeah, and he's got senseo.

673
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,920
Although I heard some rumblings in the sales weasels office,

674
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,920
that someone else is going to come in and take advantage of the hype of senseo

675
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,920
and completely replace it with a different brand stay tuned.

676
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,920
About the Trinity thing, I used to have one of those.

677
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,920
And there's a tow hitch built in, really neat underneath.

678
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:44,920
They used to be, and you kind of, the tow ball is separate.

679
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,920
It's like a really, really beautifully made bracket.

680
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Usually comes in a bag and it's in the accessories.

681
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,920
And you kind of click it in, but it's not obvious.

682
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Oh, that's what that rattling is in the bag.

683
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,920
I've always, I thought it was tools.

684
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Now I know, it's the tow hitch.

685
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,920
You know, I do recall having seen on Trinity's ass.

686
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Some kind of attachment thingy.

687
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
It's kind of very vague.

688
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,920
But now that you say that, I think that you're right.

689
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,920
She may have a built in tow bar.

690
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
Now I just have to see if the actual bar.

691
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
You know, I rosey.

692
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Rosie, now that you're fixing Trinity up,

693
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,920
and you're going to keep her running until we send her off on her on her trip.

694
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,920
Would you please take a look and call into the voicemail line?

695
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
Let me know if this is indeed true.

696
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
There was any kind of tow facility.

697
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,920
If you just look at the back of the car,

698
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,920
but it's quite often, I wouldn't be surprised

699
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,920
it wasn't a standard feature on Mercedes like that.

700
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,920
Also on the sky thing,

701
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,920
two, I've had terrible problems with sky,

702
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
with the sky plus boxes,

703
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,920
with unreliability of new ones made by Amstrad.

704
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,920
They're horrible.

705
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,920
And we've had two of them now.

706
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,920
And I have, I'm having to wait three weeks

707
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,920
for somebody to come and just change my box.

708
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,920
Anyway, let's see you at Fairhead soon.

709
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,920
I look off myself, bye.

710
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Nice touch there, Hugh,

711
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
with the plane starting up in the back.

712
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
Thank you very much.

713
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Since we've started the conversation,

714
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,920
we might as well get the theme song roll.

715
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Because we're sending her across the USA and beyond.

716
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,920
It's time to free Trinity.

717
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,920
I feel her up there and watch her go.

718
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,920
Letting everybody know that this is going to be the better way.

719
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,920
And two, three, Trinity.

720
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Trinity.

721
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
The quintessential luxury.

722
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Trinity.

723
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Trinity.

724
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Let the bio diesel set your free.

725
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Trinity.

726
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
Trinity.

727
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Trinity.

728
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
Trinity.

729
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
Trinity.

730
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
Trinity.

731
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Well, of course the email box has been filling up

732
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
the Google Groups.

733
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
The free Trinity.

734
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Google Group has already gotten like 20 or 30 members.

735
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,920
So that's starting to fill up nice and quick.

736
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
Let's see.

737
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
I'm getting emails now.

738
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,920
We have a regional biodiesel.

739
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,920
Information link has been posted.

740
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,920
People are trying to figure out how to get Trinity over to Blighty.

741
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,920
And you know, there's always people who keep saying the same thing.

742
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Which you really don't have to do is,

743
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,920
you know, why not enter Trinity in the Gumball run?

744
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,920
Which, of course, is a, you know, this is the, this has been kind of a trend.

745
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,920
Amongst posers for the past couple of years.

746
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
You see it all over the place.

747
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,920
You know, they get their Ferraris and they're souped up cars.

748
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,920
And then they drive through perhaps a piece of Eastern Europe or they drive across the US.

749
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,920
And they're all basically trying to replicate the fun of the movie Cannonball run.

750
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
But you know, it's like, come on.

751
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Man, that was 70s.

752
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,920
We can't all be burnt Reynolds, you know.

753
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
It's like, no, no, no.

754
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
This is something completely different.

755
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:59,920
We want to show the world that you can drive anywhere you want to in any country, any continent, relying purely on biodiesel,

756
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,920
which is produced by the people, not by big oil.

757
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
What did I just see?

758
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,920
Shell announced they, uh, made $25 billion in profit in 2006.

759
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
And it was kind of a bad year.

760
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,920
Now, I don't want you to get angry at the man because the reason they have so much profit is, of course,

761
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:23,920
because the prices are reasonably high, but they need that profit for the next 50 years of obtaining oil from other earth.

762
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,920
You know, the refinery is going to be much more difficult.

763
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,920
The way they drill is going to be much deeper.

764
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,920
They're using new tactics like gas to liquid and filling up drilling holes with water to push the oil up.

765
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,920
I mean, you know, and these things, a project like that is like a billion dollars for one project easy.

766
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,920
So they need that money and they will be reinvesting it.

767
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
But, you know, it's basically the end isn't site.

768
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,920
We got to do something different. We got to change all this.

769
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
So that's why we want a free trinity.

770
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Sender on her way and have her driven by podcasters enthusiast alike and stopping off at biodiesel, uh,

771
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,920
filling stations, uh, stopping off at podcasters homes, uh,

772
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,920
stopping off at, uh, places where we can get vegetable oil to create biodiesel.

773
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,920
And that's the whole idea behind the trailer hitch is to actually have a biodiesel processing unit towed behind

774
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,920
or so people can really get into it and see how easy it is.

775
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Hey Adam, this is Adam calling from Toledo, Ohio.

776
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Um, thinking about your free trinity moment.

777
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,920
If you decide to throw a trailer hitch on the trinity.

778
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,920
So you can tow it around your own, uh, biodiesel refinery.

779
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,920
Consider, um, consider stopping at mom, pop type restaurants and set a big change.

780
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,920
You know, kind of support the whole independent media independent from foreign oil independent from big

781
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,920
chains, you know, the whole American type thing.

782
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
Just like you said.

783
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Thank you.

784
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Bye.

785
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Right arm.

786
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
I think that's a very good idea.

787
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
That will even accentuate it more.

788
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,920
And you know, we want people tracking trinity and driving along with her and their biodiesel

789
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,920
the powered vehicles, you know, let's really create something new and fresh.

790
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,920
Like an old fashion like Bird Reynolds movie.

791
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,920
Hey Adam, this is Josh and Nebraska.

792
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,920
And I just wanted to share some information for the free trinity.

793
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,920
Um, I'm a computer consultant and I have a customer that uses a GPS system.

794
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,920
Um, to track his entire fleet as they're traveling across the country.

795
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,920
And basically what this does is it, um, it gives him the ability to log into a website and see exactly where

796
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,920
his fleet is.

797
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,920
And any point in time he can log in and see one particular truck where it's at on a map.

798
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,920
And then it shows how fast they're going and what direction and all that good kind of stuff

799
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
too.

800
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,920
And also has the ability to text message that driver.

801
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,920
So if they had any changes and load pickups or anything like that, that's what they use

802
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
that for.

803
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:53,200
But the idea would be that, uh, any of us listeners could actually log in to a website or you could

804
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,400
add it to a website and see exactly where trinity was at any point in time how fast she was

805
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
going and all that neat stuff.

806
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,880
So I love the show.

807
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,400
Thanks for putting it out there and we'll keep listening here in Nebraska.

808
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
Alright, man.

809
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Well, yes.

810
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Please join the Google group.

811
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
It's free trinity.

812
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,400
So it's groups.google.com slash free trinity.

813
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
I think you have to capitalize the F and the T on that one.

814
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Oh, no.

815
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
It's written as one word free trinity.

816
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Yes, yes.

817
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Yes.

818
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
This is exactly what I want.

819
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
And I want that.

820
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
And we can build this.

821
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
It's not that hard.

822
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
I mean, I can completely conceptualize it.

823
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Uh, I know these systems exist.

824
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,400
And, you know, willing to put up the money to make it happen.

825
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
And, uh, yeah.

826
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Just willing to put the money to make it happen.

827
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
I just wanted to happen.

828
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,400
So I want all this flowing back to a webpage where you can indeed not only track her progress,

829
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,400
but over each push pin, as an example of a friper map, you'd see a picture.

830
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
You can see a video.

831
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
You can hear a podcast.

832
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
You can see a video podcast.

833
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Uh, trinity will be sending back her own pictures and GPS coordinates.

834
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
See how fast she ran.

835
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
All of that stuff.

836
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Yes, it will be one completely integrated campaign.

837
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Please, if you're interested in helping out join the Google Group.

838
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Hey, Adam, this is Cory.

839
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
And this is Jen.

840
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
And we're from Bucket.

841
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Hey, buddy.

842
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
We heard you talking about the free trinity thing.

843
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,400
And we wanted to say that you could time to come down this way toward

844
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
homage country here in Pennsylvania.

845
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,400
And I just want you to know that Bucket, uh, which is a pod show podcast,

846
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,400
we're headquartered right here in the heart of homage country.

847
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Um, so we love relatively.

848
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
So we love to have you and trinity.

849
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Take a stop by the area here.

850
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,400
And we be glad to guide you through the scenic farmlands of, uh,

851
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Lancaster County down here.

852
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Interest of saving the world and winning valuable prizes, of course.

853
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Absolutely.

854
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Um, now a couple of things real quick.

855
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Uh, you remember we're talking about the different cultures of the homage.

856
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,400
One thing they don't really like is they don't like to be, uh,

857
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
photograph your video taped.

858
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Uh, they have a thing in their, uh, in their religion.

859
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Uh, that they don't like.

860
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,400
It's, uh, kind of a thing that they believe that cameras capture their soul.

861
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
And also they have a thing about being vain.

862
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
And that's why they don't have photos in their home.

863
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
And the whole technology thing too.

864
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
That's right.

865
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
So, but they do use some limited technology.

866
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
They do a lot.

867
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Some of them do drive in car.

868
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
They ride in cars.

869
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
As long as they're as a non-armage driver.

870
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
They have like, homage taxi services that go around and pick up, uh,

871
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,400
uh, homage families and vans.

872
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
So it's, they do use cars.

873
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
They just don't drive them themselves.

874
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Anyway, the point is we thought that we'd love to be involved in free trinity.

875
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,400
And if you did want to drive it through homage country and possibly try to look up,

876
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,400
and maybe have a chance to record some homage people.

877
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
I think Cory and I are the people for the job.

878
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Yes, absolutely.

879
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,400
So definitely give us a ring at, uh, or give us an email,

880
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,400
book a podcast at gmail.com and let us know if you'd be interested.

881
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Yeah, man.

882
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
We're waiting.

883
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
All right.

884
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Well, kids, please join the list.

885
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Sign up to the group.

886
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,400
How much people have homage taxi cabs?

887
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,400
That's totally something new for me.

888
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Hi.

889
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
This is that one.

890
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,400
What I want to find out what to do for our environment.

891
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,400
I listen to sustainable business practices.

892
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Oh, my gosh.

893
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
Shameless plug.

894
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Hey, Adam.

895
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
It's Doug Pilgrim.

896
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Oh, man.

897
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
What a week.

898
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,400
It's hard to believe that it was just a week ago that a little bit over a week ago,

899
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,400
that you were complaining about a broken down 23 year old station wagon.

900
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,400
And I had a windshield day dream.

901
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
And now, look at where we are.

902
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,400
I have to tell you this completely blows my mind that we're having a discussion from Australia

903
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,400
to Italy about renewable energy and biodiesel.

904
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,400
I mean, this is just gone beyond my wildest hopes and expectations.

905
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
I think this is absolutely fantastic.

906
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,400
You know, this, of course, is Doug Pilgrim, the guy who kind of started all off by offering to drive

907
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,400
Trinity from San Francisco to Boston with his son who's in that was at sea right now.

908
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
I believe.

909
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,400
So Doug is, of course, the OG of free Trinity.

910
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,400
This really just goes to show, you know, the power of one and the power of podcasting.

911
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,400
The ability for all of us to get that, to get a message out there.

912
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,400
And I can't wait to tell my son when he gets off the ship.

913
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
What's been going on?

914
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,400
He's been at sea for the last month with the mass maritime academy and he's been out of the

915
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
communication.

916
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
I can hear him now.

917
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Dad, you know, what the F, have you started now?

918
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,400
So I think this has just been a phenomenal acceptance among everybody that's out there.

919
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,400
And, you know, it's just so important to have this discussion now.

920
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Now, from a environmental standpoint, from an economic standpoint, from a political standpoint, from a moral standpoint.

921
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,400
And here in the US, we are addicted like crack addicts sucking on the petroleum pipe.

922
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,400
And, you know, quite frankly, something has to break.

923
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:51,400
You know, I'm sorry, Mr. President, but reducing our gasoline consumption by 20% in the next 10 years,

924
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
8, enough.

925
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,400
And, you know, it's going to take people to drive this.

926
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,400
It's going to take every one of us to make our own choice.

927
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,400
And, you know, force businesses to follow us in a new direction.

928
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,400
So I think by promoting something like this, it's just going to help move this whole discussion,

929
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,400
and the whole movement along that much quicker, which leads me to my next idea.

930
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:21,400
Now that we pretty much move Trinity out of your garage, what are we going to put back in her place?

931
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,400
You know, I'm sorry, but, you know, to stick a gas-guzzling jag into a garage there in San Francisco.

932
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
Yeah, hold on a second.

933
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,400
I never said I was going to stick a gas-guzzling jag in the garage in San Francisco.

934
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,400
In fact, yes, dear.

935
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
I can't hear you.

936
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Hold on.

937
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
What's that?

938
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Listen to you.

939
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,400
But it's weird, you're like standing behind me, and it's like, if you want to listen, come up here.

940
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Yeah, it's weird.

941
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,400
It's like having someone talk and then you're behind them.

942
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,400
You can't join in because you broke the headphones, remember?

943
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Yeah.

944
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
All right.

945
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,400
Can I continue?

946
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,400
Yeah.

947
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
Okay.

948
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Thank you.

949
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:12,400
In fact, today we made a big decision, and Patricia got the new car, the smart roaster,

950
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
which comes what next week, Tuesday.

951
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
I don't like that.

952
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,400
And, you know, I mean, yeah, we drive the super V8, but rarely.

953
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,400
You know, it's like a tank of gas, it's probably last us a month.

954
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:33,400
Anyway, decided to do a little bit better on the CO2 emissions.

955
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:41,400
You know, there's a big difference between a 4.2 liter engine V8 and a 2.5 liter engine.

956
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,400
So scaling down the sizes of the car, I'll tell you more about it.

957
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,400
I'll probably post a picture here on the web log when she's in, but definitely looking

958
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,400
at something different.

959
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,400
Now, for San Francisco, never said I wanted a Jagu.

960
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
It was Patricia who wanted any car as long as it was a Jaguar.

961
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,400
Not me.

962
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,400
I'm an Audi guy.

963
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
Yeah, she loved Jagu.

964
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,400
All right.

965
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,400
So what's your suggestion then, Doug?

966
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,400
It's just not going to work.

967
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,400
I mean, to be kind of hypocritical at this point, don't you think?

968
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,400
And I think you'd be sending the wrong message.

969
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,400
And by the way, did British petroleum ever send you a thank you card for buying that Jaguar?

970
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:20,400
So instead, what I propose is putting a Tesla Roadster in that place.

971
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Now, a Tesla Roadster is 100% electric sports car.

972
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,400
Zero to 60 and four seconds.

973
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:35,400
130 miles an hour screaming down the highway to Cedar and 250 miles between each charge.

974
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
I think this is a great idea.

975
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,400
And it has a base price of $92,000.

976
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
Oh, only $92,000.

977
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,400
What a steal.

978
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,400
So Doug, let me just tell you, I was at the launch of this car.

979
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,400
Ray Lane bought one.

980
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,400
He's one of our investors.

981
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,400
And remember that was the story where we flew down on his jet to Los Angeles.

982
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,400
And we had a horrible landing and Ray went flying through the cabin.

983
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,400
And when I was really happy about that,

984
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,400
because it doesn't mean that I'm the only shitty pilot.

985
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Those things are amazing.

986
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,400
It's right. They go from zero to the 60 and like four seconds.

987
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Amazingly fast.

988
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,400
But it's basically they're using the body of a lotus.

989
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
I don't know if you've ever seen a lotus.

990
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,400
Man, this is like, it's too small for me.

991
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,400
It's too small.

992
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,400
And besides, the waiting list is so long.

993
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,400
I don't think, and this was, she was at four, four months ago.

994
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
Only five months ago that Ray ordered his.

995
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
He still hasn't received his car.

996
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,400
So when he does, though,

997
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Guess who has dibs on a couple of test drives.

998
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
You know, I'm going to finnake it out of his hand,

999
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,400
so I can drive it around San Francisco for a little while just to,

1000
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,400
to do some research.

1001
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,400
Call that a steal.

1002
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,400
A steal for the pod father.

1003
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,400
I mean, for the rock and roll star of pod casting,

1004
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,400
you deserve to be driving around in a car like this.

1005
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,400
So here's the next concept.

1006
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,400
We're going to call this the free Adam project.

1007
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
I love you, man.

1008
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
I forget about that.

1009
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
I don't need to be free.

1010
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,400
I'm one of the freeest guys you'll know.

1011
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:35,400
So if you want to participate, all you have to do is join the Google Group.

1012
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,400
You can't play with me.

1013
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,400
Groups.google.com.

1014
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
Slash free.

1015
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400
Turn it on.

1016
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,400
Play safe.

1017
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,400
If you want nice and beautiful,

1019
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,400
something that I do you with,

1020
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,400

00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
Everything here is free.

00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,400
Still you take our apprehenses.

1024
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,400
Everything comes in three.

1025
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,400
So you make sure who's the last lap is.

1026

1029
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,400
you're not the way you stand.

1030
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400

Play your sunshine, but there's not a cure

1089
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:10,400
If I stay until I go blind and I'm trying to find some shade

1090
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:18,400
It closed my eyes at night, but the world comes in a way

1091
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,400
And there's no way, leaving side, everything is free

1092
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,400
Do you take our applications, everything comes in free

1093

If you won't sit down, you'll have nothing to waste

1098
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,400
Yeah, you might be right, but you still got nothing to spend

1099
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,400
If you won't sit down, then you'll never understand

1100
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,400
That thornly stand from the pod save music network

1101
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,400
Of course say inspired by a dog's little promo there at the beginning

They're pronounced decay to

1120
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,400
In a gossip magazine in fact the same one that stole our pictures

1121

Yes

1122
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,400
What did they publish?

00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,400
What is in it this week?

1124
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,400
We are very big on the cover

1125
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,400
Said my, that's what my mom said

1126
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,400
But we're very big undercover, what does that mean?

1127
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
On the cover of the magazine

1128
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,400
On the cover of the magazine with a big, big yellow thing over it

1129
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,400
And it says

1130
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,400
How do you say that when you want this resort?

1131
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,400

You're wanted

Yeah

1140
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,400
Because you are escaping

1141
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,400
From everybody in Holland because

1142
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,400
Because they're yes, I am because they're idiots

1143
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
Of course I'm escaping

1144
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,400
I think I've done a good job of escaping Holland

1145
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,400
Yeah, because people need, I don't know, people get money from you

People get money, what does that mean?

1148
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,400
Yeah

1149
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,400

You don't know what it says, do you?

1151
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,400
Oh my mom said

1152
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,400
Yeah, your mom, by the way your mom is a complete authority

1153
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,400
On relaying information

1154
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,400
She read it for me

1155
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,400
Yeah

00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,400
And so what's the point?

00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,400
What does it say?

1158
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,400
What is the point of the car?

1159
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,400
What is the point of the car?

1160
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,400
That's what I want to know

1161
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,400

You're running away from everything

Today I'm very sad

1169
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Yes

1170
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,400
I'm running away

1171
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,400
And you are just starting a company

1172
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,400
Just started a company in America

1173
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,400

Of course not

1176
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,400
That's why you drive in

Attunity

1178
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,400
A very old car

1179
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,400
Who just broke down?

1180
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,400
Yeah, that's right

1181
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,400
You told it yourself

1182
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,400
Yeah

1183
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,400
Yeah, so it's true

1184
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,400
That's where you got it from

1185
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,400
Yeah

1186
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
And it's sad

1187
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,400
Everything is sad

00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,400
And so everybody is looking for you

1189
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,400
Everybody is looking for you

1190
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,400
Yeah

1191
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,400
But what is the school that I've seen in English?

1192
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,400
I don't know

1193
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,400
It's someone who is looking for someone who thinks I owe the money

1194
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Yeah

00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,400

Or get off my show

00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,400
I don't know what it is in English

1199
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,400
Because I'm trying to tell you

1200
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,400
But you keep talking away from the microphone

1201
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,400
I'm fine

1202
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,400
It's a credit

1203
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,400
A creditor

1204
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,400
A creditor

1205
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,400
Oh yeah

1206
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,400
Is that what I mean?

1207
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,400
Not to be confused with predator

1208
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,400
No

1209
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,400
A creditor

1210
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,400
Yeah

1211
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,400
So I owe someone money

1212
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Is that what we're saying?

1213
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,400
Yeah

1214
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,400
Well shit, I don't know

1215
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
No

1216
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,400
All these gossip magazines seem to find out

1217
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,400
Where I live

1218
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,400
Well I have to say

1219
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,400
It's

1220
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,400
Remember we

1221
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Were this guy

1222
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,400
Months and months

1223
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,400
You know we were talking about

1224
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,400
Mark Fondalinder

1225
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,400
Fadass Mark Fondalinder

1226
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,400
Back

1227
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,400
He is satisfying

1228
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,400
He's friend

1229
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,400
The other diva

1230
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,400
Did they have a good picture of us?

1231
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,400
There is a good picture

1232
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,400
Yeah

1233
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,400
It's not bad

1234
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,400
Mom said

1235
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,400
I said it was the picture mom

1236
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,400
And she said no

1237
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,400
No no

1238
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,400
I said that's good

1239
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,400
As long as the picture is okay

1240
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,400
Oh my goodness

1241
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,400
Yeah

1242
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,400
It was quiet for long time

1243
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,400
But then mommy has to do a somba

1244
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,400
Which was too good

1245
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,400
Did I not tell you that this is exactly what happens

1246
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,400
Is the minute you show yourself

1247
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,400
They start digging stuff up

1248
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,400
And of course

1249
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,400
It's easy to dig up stuff on me

1250
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,400
Because there's all kinds of shit around

1251
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,400
I'm fine

1252
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,400
I'm fine

1253
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,400
That's right

1254
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,400
That's what I keep telling you

1255
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,400
It's like

1256
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,400
But they put your name next to mine

1257
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,400
So you may want to dissociate yourself from me

1258
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,400
I think we should

1259
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
I think we should take it all the way

1260
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,400
I think we should say that we're divorced

1261
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,400
I'm living in San Francisco

1262
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
And what happened is you took all the money

1263
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Yeah

1264
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,400
You took all the money

1265
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,400
That's why I just bought a new car

1266
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
You just bought a new car

1267
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,400
And I'm in San Francisco

1268
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
In a broken down Mercedes 300

1269
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,400
Turbo diesel station

1270
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,400
Wow

1271
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,400
I'm very sad

1272
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,400
I'm very sad

1273
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,400
It's a fucking sad

1274
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,400
Yeah

1275
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
Now Mark finally in this very sad

1276
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,400
As long as it doesn't take our pictures

1277
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,400
No

1278
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,400
Is there a picture of Trinity?

1279
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,400
No

1280
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,400
Not from the Trinity

1281
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,400
What do they have just a picture of us?

1282
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,400
Yeah

1283
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,400
Oh wait

1284
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,400
Maybe I can look at it online

1285
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,400

On their internet site

I did

1325
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,400
Is there something wrong with me saying that

1326
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,400
Am I not allowed to see

1327
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,400
Now of course you don't have any

00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Oh here it is

1329
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,400
In the past week there was an advertisement

1330
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,400
In a newspaper

1331
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,400
Of a creditor that is looking to find

What do they call it?

1337
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,400

1344
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,400
Address

00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,400
Yes we are

1347
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,400

00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,400
Maybe stop

1349
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,400
They're going to

1350
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,400
They're stepping around

1351
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,400
Really

1352
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,400
They're going to extra

1353
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,400
Dite me to the Netherlands

1354
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,400
And two trucks

1355
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,400
Two trucks

1356
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,400
Two trucks

1357
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,400
Two trucks

1358
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,400
Just for shipping around

1359
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,400
Yeah such ideas

1360
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,400
I wonder what it is though

1361
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,400
Well if anyone needs to find me

1362
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,400
They know where how to find me

1363
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,400
That's so easy

1364
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,400
But

1365
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,400
But you know that the neighbors

1366
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,400
The warned us

1367
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,400
There were

1368
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,400
You know people at her door

1369
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,400
Looking for us

1370
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,400
Our neighbor

1371
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,400
Where we moved to

1372
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,400
She said

1373
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,400
I'm not going to tell you

1374
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,400
Because I really screw that

1375
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,400
You never know

1376
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,400
Screw that

1377
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,400
Yeah

1378
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,400
But if they're really serious

1379
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,400
You can always find it

1380
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,400
You know what I think this is

1381
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,400
I know what this is

1382
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,400
Oh yes

1383
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,400
Yes I do

1384
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,400
Because I was asked about this

1385
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,400
A year ago

1386
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,400
Do you remember

1387
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,400
Helikom

1388
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,400
The first helicopter company

1389
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,400
That I took lessons from

1390
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,400
Okay

1391
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,400
So here's what happened

1392
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,400
So I flew with Helikom

1393
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,400
For a god

1394
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,400
I don't know

1395
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,400
Two years maybe

1396
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,400
I flew with them

1397
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,400
Yeah

1398
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,400
And each flight was easily

1399
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,400
I mean it could have been

1400
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,400
400 euros

1401
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,400
A thousand euros

1402
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,400
It depends on how far we would fly

1403
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,400
And so I met

1404
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,400
Wing Commander William

1405
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,400
Yeah

1406
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,400
After like two years

1407
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,400
And then flew with him

1408
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,400
For another two years

1409
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,400
Perhaps flew with him

1410
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,400
Yeah

1411
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,400
And after

1412
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,400
So I had had stop flying with Helikom

1413
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,400
And a year and a half

1414
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,400
After I stopped flying with him

1415
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,400
They sent me a bill for

1416
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,400
I think like three or four thousand euros

1417
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,400
Saying that these were flights that I hadn't paid for

1418
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,400
A year and a half

1419
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,400
After

1420
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,400
And by the way

1421
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,400
They went through a bankruptcy

1422
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,400
And they were in trouble

1423
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,400
And they were in trouble

1424
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,400
And they were looking for money

1425
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,400
And they were looking for money

1426
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,400
And so they sent me the invoice

1427
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,400
And I said look

1428
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,400
You're just sending me fucking invoice

1429
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,400
Show me the logs

1430
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,400
Show me all the books

1431
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,400
Show me I really did these flights

1432
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,400
Because I don't know

1433
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
It's like a year and a half ago

1434
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,400
I would have to go and defend myself

1435
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,400
It's stupid invoice

1436
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,400
If you show me

1437
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,400
Then you never know

1438
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,400
It's all about

1439
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,400
Right

1440
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
And so

1441
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
They never showed you

1442
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,400
No, of course they never showed it to me

1443
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,400
I think they

1444
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,400
I think they put a freeze on one of our bank accounts

1445
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,400
For like 4,000 euros or whatever

1446
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,400
And I'm like okay

1447
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,400
I'll just let it sit there

1448
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,400
I still get interest on the money

1449
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
I don't need to spend the money

1450
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,400
And so whenever they feel like

1451
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,400
Proving that I actually made those flights

1452
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,400
I think there was an advertisement from them

1453
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,400
Yeah

1454
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,400
I mean it's looking for you

1455
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,400
Yeah

1456
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,400
That's like it's part of legal proceeding

1457
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,400
So then they can you know

1458
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,400
So they probably

1459
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,400
They probably sued me

1460
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,400
I don't know

1461
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,400
I didn't receive any paperwork

1462
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,400
So maybe they sued me

1463
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,400
And maybe the judge said

1464
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,400
They don't know where to send it

1465
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,400
Yeah because he didn't show

1466
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,400
So maybe they forced their way

1467
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,400
Into the foreground or whatever

1468
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,400
But it's not a big deal

1469
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,400
Certainly not

1470
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,400
Certainly not

1471
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,400
Not worth the front cover

1472
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,400
Not an hour world

1473
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,400
Certainly not

1474
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,400
Yeah

1475
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,400
Certainly not the

1476
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,400
Worth the front cover

1477
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,400
Of the gossip

1478
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,400
No but you know

1479
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,400
If you need something

1480
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,400
Talking

1481
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,400
If you want to find something

1482
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,400
Need something

1483
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,400
To write something

1484
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,400
Bad in your magazine

1485
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,400
Anything

1486
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,400
Anything

1487
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,400
Anything is of course

1488
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,400
Well I say

1489
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,400
Come on

1490
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,400
Come on over here

1491
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,400
And get it

1492
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Come on over here and get it boys

1493
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,400
Well

1494
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,400
And just prove to me

1495
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,400
Yeah

1496
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,400
If that's what it is

1497
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,400
I can't think of anything else

1498
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,400
We have no business

1499
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,400
No we have

1500
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,400
I pay for one car

1501
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Yeah

1502
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,400
I still pay

1503
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,400
Lawyers and Accountants

1504
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,400
Yeah

1505
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,400
That shit goes on forever

1506
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,400
Yeah

1507
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,400
I can't think of anything else

1508
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
No but you know

1509
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,400
As we call it

1510
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,400
Even if it's not true

1511
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,400
A storm and a glass of water

1512
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,400
Yeah but they can ride anything

1513
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,400
They want

1514
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,400
Yeah that's true

1515
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,400
As long as they don't place any pictures

1516
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,400
I'm fine

1517
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,400
Yeah

1518
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,400
And luckily this building right

1519
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,400
In a certain way then it's

1520
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,400
There's nothing wrong about it

1521
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,400
I'm on the run

1522
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,400
You are

1523
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,400
I'm on the run

1524
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,400
Go lock the door

1525
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,400
I'm on the run

1526
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,400
That's why you're going

1527
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,400
Every two weeks

1528
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,400
Of course I have to change my location

1529
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
As I got to change my location

1530
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,400
If they find me then they're going to get me

1531
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
The booge man is out to get me

1532
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,400
You know

1533
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,400
They listen to your show

1534
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,400
Get all the information

1535
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,400
You know what I said less

1536
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,400
You know when we did the show

1537
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,400
Also with me

1538
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,400
Then all the things we're saying

1539
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,400
They're using it

1540
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,400
Isn't that sad

1541
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,400
Well

1542
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,400
But it was very quiet

1543
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,400
And I told you that if you do anything in the Netherlands

1544
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,400
Then it's exciting

1545
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,400
It's exciting

1546
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,400
Yeah of course

1547
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,400
It's exciting

1548
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,400
You did a good dance

1549
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,400
I did a very good job

1550
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,400
That's fine

1551
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,400
So basically it's your fault now

1552
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,400
That my name was like

1553
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,400
You know what I was saying

1554
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,400
Self-aclaimed

1555
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,400
Self-aclaimed

1556
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,400
Yeah so I just

1557
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,400
Oh dude

1558
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,400
I get all the time

1559
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,400
Now I get the whole is like

1560
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,400
The self-proclaimed podfather

1561
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,400
I didn't call myself the podfather

1562
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,400
Then I say self-proclaimed

1563
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,400
Proclaimed

1564
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,400
Proclaimed

1565
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,400
Okay, yeah

1566
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,400
That's what it says too

1567
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,400
Yeah

1568
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,400
I never called myself

1569
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,400
You know one day we really

1570
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,400
One day we really will run away

1571
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,400
When our daughters all grown up

1572
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,400
And boy

1573
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,400
Let me tell you

1574
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,400
People can be really sad

1575
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,400
They'll have nothing left

1576
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,400
Nothing left a bit

1577
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,400
You're mowing about

1578
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,400
Yeah really

1579
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,400
I'll be mowing

1580
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,400
All right

1581
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,400
Okay

1582
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,400
