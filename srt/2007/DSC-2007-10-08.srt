16
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And now one of the best shows in NewMudia, Adam Curry.

17
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, sorry, of course yesterday and no show, that's because left for Germany on Germany.

18
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
On Sunday, for a number of meetings that we had scheduled, our local guy on the scene, Dr. Will.

19
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
His name is Will home, we just call him Dr. Will. He is a, he's funny, in Germany if you have a title, if you have a PhD, then you introduce yourself as a doctor.

20
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And so, so that's what we call him Dr. Will. He's essentially consultant who's skilled in helping foreign companies set up shop in Germany.

21
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And so, wow, man, I was actually planning on flying out myself.

22
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Sunday was perfect.

23
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You know, the idea was to go to, uh, shown haven, uh, airfield, which is just, uh, to the south of Potsdam, which in turn is just to the, uh, south west of Berlin all within like a 20 mile radius.

24
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And I was prepared, man, I had everything, I had my flight plans, I had my three GPS's configured, I had alternates, everything that mapped out because this was going to be the first time.

25
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I was going to a foreign country to a foreign airfield because I've never been to the Potsdam airfield before, or shown haven.

26
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And, um, you know, so, uh, a new territory. And, uh, and basically, setting out in a journey.

27
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I, uh, discussed it with Wing Commander William and, uh, you know, he, he always just wants to make sure I'm prepared for everything.

28
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I was all set to go. And then I realized that, um, we actually get a lot more benefit out of it if, uh, if Ron and I who was still over here.

29
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
In the UK, uh, after the digital music awards, if we would, uh, you know, if we flew together, we'd have a little more time to chat.

30
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And if I knew that if I was going to fly him in the Delta Sierra, uh, there would be no time for, uh, for business chat.

31
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because, you know, I'd be like, uh, trying to concentrate on, uh, what the hell I'm doing.

32
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You know, I can't think of anything else, but flying when I'm flying.

33
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Uh, so today, actually, I'm quite glad that, uh, that we turned around, uh, that swiftly actually decided to come back last night.

34
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, and, of course, I have some stories about airport security to share with you.

35
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, man. It's just as ridiculous in Europe as it is in the US.

36
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because otherwise, I was returning on that, planning on returning this morning.

37
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Uh, probably would have left already, it might have been, uh, underway for at least an hour.

38
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Uh, but the weather is quite shit, uh, across the channel. Um, and now, you know, clouds are not necessarily problem.

39
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Low ceiling is not a problem. When you get thunderstorms, uh, that's going to be a problem.

40
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Because, you know, as we've discussed, you do not want to be flying into thunderstorms just not a good idea.

41
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So, uh, Germany, wow, uh, once again, a fantastic trip.

42
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hi, Adam. This is longtime listener, Michael said we're in need.

43
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Did I hear you say pop stand in Germany? And at the third, six, six time?

44
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I was just there a few weeks ago for a friend's wedding. And what a great town.

45
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Uh, just wondering if jobless things for pod show, pod stand are going to be listed on podshow.com.

46
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I went there and I didn't see anything listed for Germany or London.

47
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Uh, love a show. Keep it up.

48
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Y'all mom.

49
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Uh, yes. Uh, so it will. We're not quite ready yet to, uh, to be doing open, uh, open calls, if you will, uh, for people to come and join us.

50
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Actually, it would be a podshow Germany, uh, but I do like the idea of podstom, uh, podshow podstom.

51
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We're not, uh, 100% certain that it's going to be in podstom, but I would say, I would say 95%.

52
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We've seen real estate, uh, both in Berlin and in podstom. What I'd like about podstom behind besides it's, uh,

53
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
very historic significance throughout, uh, centuries, actually.

54
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Um, the space that we're looking at is in this, uh, legendary, uh, movie, movie complex, studio complex,

55
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
uh, Marlene Dietrich, uh, didn't movies there. I mean, there's just a lot of history to the place.

56
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Really, really like in that. There's one other incredible advantage, uh, that comes with, uh,

57
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
being in the Brondonburg area, which is where podstom is.

58
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Listen to this, it's unbelievable. For every employee you hire the government, the German government,

59
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
in podstom, not in Berlin, but in podstom, will give you 50% of that employee salary in subsidy.

60
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So if you hire someone for, uh, say 50,000, uh, euros a year, 25,000 of those euros will come right back to the company.

61
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Um, and that's the cap, by the way, is the 50,000. So if you hired someone for 100,000 euros,

62
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
then you'd still only get 25 because the, the maximum is, uh, is half of the 50,000 deduction,

63
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
but it doesn't matter how many employees you have unlimited.

64
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Incredible. Uh, Berlin does have something similar, but that doesn't start until you have a minimum of 20 employees.

65
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And, uh, we're a ways off from that yet. And we, we don't even have the 15 yet in the UK.

66
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Uh, so that's, uh, that's a pretty big incentive I'd have to say. This is how it works people.

67
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is how it works. This is how, uh, regions and countries and cities attract businesses and,

68
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and get them to set up shop. Very interesting, uh, to see this type of incentive.

69
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So, uh, had a great time. Um, there was, uh, there was also a conference going on in, um, in Berlin,

70
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
a, uh, what, I could forget the name of it. It was like broadband wireless, something conference.

71
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Wasn't a big one, but it was a lot of IPTV, uh, representatives from around the globe trying to figure this shit out.

72
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Seems like there's still a lot of technological issues that, that they're dealing with.

73
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Uh, so I actually even sent, uh, a little, uh, a little text message to, uh, our Savant, uh,

74
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
comic strip blogger thinking he might be in Berlin, uh, for this conference, unfortunately he wasn't.

75
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But of course, you know, whenever you tickled the comic strip blogger well, comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip,

76
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Uh, if you tickle them, usually will show up. Hello, madam Adam Kahlo. So here is your European Union correspondent.

77
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,640
So, what's up lately, in your opinion?

78
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:06,720
Firstly, bureaucrats want to pass new e-o-3T through vectors without having getting public

79
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,200
popular vote.

80
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,160
Okay, wait a minute, so I just a quick translation there.

81
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,640
So what I understand is in the European Parliament, they want to pass laws and regulations

82
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,840
without a popular vote on said subjects.

83
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:27,440
US American dollar is now so fucking cheap with regard to euro currency and some other European

84
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:35,720
currencies that EU citizens are wiping their feds with US American banknotes.

85
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:43,280
Another thing, since now some new EU countries are joining the euro zone, so the currency

86
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,160
zone includes us as Slovenia, it was last year, it includes Malta and Cyprus that are

87
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,880
joining by the end of this year.

88
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:58,200
The new euro coins are being made now, where however, Turkey has been wiped out from the

89
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,000
map of Europe on this coin.

90
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So, of course, it is because you've got some people, but I have to say that the French President

91
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,080
Circusy no longer is objecting to the membership of Turkey in EU.

92
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
So that's it.

93
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Thanks for listening.

94
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,080
Fuck you, too.

95
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,560
Fuck you, too.

96
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,100
I think all, whenever you call in, please, whenever you call in, end your call with

97
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,400
fuck you, Adam Curry, fuck you, please, it really makes me laugh.

98
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,400
And not just you, see us be anyone, anyone calling in, please, and that way.

99
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
I like it.

100
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,240
All right, so if I understand correctly, you tell me that European coins are being minted,

101
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,560
and the Turkey is not represented on the little map there, that's interesting.

102
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,440
I did bring back some euros, so they're probably older ones, but I'll take a look.

103
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,640
Even though, as you say, Circusy has no objections now to Turkey joining the EU, we will, of

104
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,800
course, follow the situation quite closely.

105
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Wow, man.

106
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
The numbers are in.

107
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Let me, here I go.

108
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Telling you the numbers are in, shit, my mouse is stuck here with the hell, is up with

109
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
that.

110
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,680
Is that just a low battery on the Bluetooth?

111
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
My goodness.

112
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Where is it?

113
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Hold on.

114
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,480
Don't, don't go away.

115
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,600
I want to share.

116
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,400
Sorry about that.

117
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,880
Here we go.

118
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,120
Remember, we did backstage pass during the digital musical awards, during the, the actual

119
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,880
recording, the taping of the award.

120
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,280
The show aired on Friday here on Channel 4 in the UK.

121
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,200
I've got the numbers in.

122
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,480
These are mainly coming directly from, from Akamai, who did the, the, the big scale part

123
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,560
of our live stream, which, of course, is still running at

124
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,240
the plus TV.com.

125
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,560
You can get to it from the homepage at,

126
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,360
paucho.com or bt paucho.com.

127
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Check this out.

128
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,280
Whereas it, unique stream views.

129
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,560
And these are just the rough, low numbers.

130
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,360
So it's probably going to end up a little bit higher.

131
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,000
But what we have already calculated,

132
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,080
850,000 unique streams.

133
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,480
So that has to be individual computers.

134
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,480
Over the 72 hour period of our, just let's just call it a broadcast, I guess.

135
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:28,280
850,000, that's almost three times the viewing audience for the awards on television.

136
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,640
Of course, that aired at midnight, but still, that's almost three times.

137
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:40,040
Overall, average viewing time, about six and a half minutes.

138
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,760
However, during the actual event itself, when we had all of our red carpet, so we had

139
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,960
our, basically, we, we broke it up into three parts.

140
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,040
We had the pre-amble, which was a full day and then leading up to the awards itself.

141
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,200
Excuse me, then we had the show where people were coming off stage.

142
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,520
We were interviewing them at our backstage, backstage, past pit area.

143
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,600
And then people, you know, then we had the wrap up and rewind is what we call them.

144
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,320
We look back at all the great stuff that happened.

145
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,280
So during that middle piece, during the awards, the average viewing time was 22 minutes,

146
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
22 minutes.

147
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,240
I mean, this, this thing worked.

148
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,800
People actually sat there and watched entertainment, streaming live on their television.

149
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,280
Hi Adam, it's Sam here and you, Ty, just that sort of London.

150
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,720
I just wanted to say, I've just had a fantastic evening of entertainment.

151
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,200
I've been sat watching the plus and, uh,

152
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,880
looking at some of the coverage from the DNA awards and man, I'm blown away by your content.

153
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,440
It's just fucking awesome.

154
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,880
Um, I've got one small criticism, Adam, Ace.

155
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,520
Alright, so first, let me wallow in that for a second before you go into the criticism.

156
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,480
I knew it.

157
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,280
I knew it.

158
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,320
If you just, if you, this is your MTV went right.

159
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,800
And this is what it would look like if they went left.

160
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,320
Keep with a short form video.

161
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,040
But it's not just music videos, it's, it's, it's interviews,

162
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,880
it's segments, it's episodes from podcasts from the video podcast.

163
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,920
It's music videos, uh, it's YouTube hits.

164
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,160
It's, uh, the best from daily motion.

165
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,440
All of this stuff.

166
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,400
That is exactly what MTV would have been today.

167
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,760
I don't think they can back into it.

168
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
So we're just moving ahead forward.

169
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,360
And of course, the beauty is we have this complete huge bucket of, of, of shows that we can

170
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,640
draw from to schedule.

171
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,400
It's, it's all on the network already.

172
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,480
So it's, uh, I'm glad you like it.

173
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,560
Uh, and of course, it's 24, seven.

174
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,240
It does not stop, uh, right now it's one feed for the entire world.

175
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,240
We're already thinking about creating a secondary feed for Europe.

176
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,280
And then maybe even do one for Asia, theplustv.com.

177
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,720
Alright, now now you can go ahead and, and break me down if you don't mind.

178
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,480
For sight, it's horrible.

179
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh, so the out is in the ages to find it.

180
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,960
Yeah, alright.

181
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,680
Alright.

182
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,960
Yes.

183
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,560
That too is changing.

184
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,800
I've mentioned it several times before.

185
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,000
Uh, in November you should start to see some of, uh, some of the, uh, the third version

186
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,720
now of Pod Show site going to beta as we say here.

187
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,400
Uh, and somewhere, uh, either the end of the year or the beginning of the year, it'll be

188
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,240
launched full time, uh, live.

189
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,640
It is such an incredible difference to what we have now that we're, we're really going to

190
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,600
work very carefully on, uh, on the integration, uh, so that we don't break stuff that is

191
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,800
already working just fine.

192
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Thank you.

193
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,000
Hey, Adam, this is Terrence from Texas.

194
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I was checking out music plus the other day and I thought it was pretty neat thing.

195
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,040
Um, it's actually a really nice format to have actually one screen until, instead of a

196
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,760
five or six in at the same time, blaring.

197
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,080
But, uh, there was good music coming from it, but, uh, the last couple of days, I haven't

198
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,840
been able to find it, um, and there's, uh, advertises, uh, something about look out in

199
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
major tests.

200
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,920
Yeah, just listening to the beginning of that comment.

201
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,320
If you're looking for music plus TV dot com, then you're going to be disappointed.

202
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,320
I don't think that you were, you were watching the plus TV dot com or just go to

203
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,680
Pod, Pod Show dot com or BT Pod Show dot com, you'll find a link right on the home

204
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
page.

205
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,040
I think this conspiracy stuff is, is getting out of hand, but, um, anyway, I hope

206
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,000
nothing really serious is going on.

207
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,800
I hope to see music plus backup.

208
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
The plus.

209
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,840
Um, anyway, I was, uh, it's a third, but, uh, all the same, good luck with everything.

210
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,160
And I hope that, uh, the sites were stored soon.

211
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
So, uh, I look forward to it.

212
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Have a good one.

213
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Alright, man.

214
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Bye.

215
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Yeah.

216
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
So, the site is, uh, obviously still there.

217
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,360
Uh, one thing that we did have to change, which, uh, we're working on feverishly.

218
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,320
Bisiony, we had all these interactive bits where it would show you what's coming up next.

219
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,600
And, um, uh, I'd also, so you can get this show immediately, the one that's playing.

220
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,160
We've had to turn that off because it's just been too much traffic.

221
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
And this was running on, uh, on a separate server.

222
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,080
It really, the whole thing was still proof of concept.

223
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
But it took off.

224
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:59,080
And, uh, until now, we're, we're reinforcing everything with steel beams, uh, post launch.

225
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,000
Uh, so that'll be, uh, up and running again as soon as we can get it rolling.

226
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,720
It's, there's a lot of excitement about this.

227
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,080
I'm totally flabbergast at how many people tuned into watch this, theplustv.com.

228
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,440
Hey Adam, start from Chicago.

229
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,920
I called, um, a couple of days ago in the plus TV cranked out, but, uh, uh, uh, the U.S.

230
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,520
answering machine was, uh, must have been full and booted me, man.

231
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,400
I just, uh, and I'm listening to Super Friday and I said, nobody called them to the UK.

232
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,760
So I'm like, dad, damn it, I'm going to call it to the U.S. line and, you know,

233
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,520
I don't think that's, I mean, that's fabulous.

234
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,880
I've been, I've been checking, uh, you know, since it kicked off with the DNAs and all

235
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,560
weekend and everything and, uh, by God, man, you are kicking ass and taking

236
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
names, man.

237
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
That is just, just beautiful.

238
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,880
I definitely get that, you know, my, uh, JJ kind of Allen 105, you know,

239
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,000
grassroots MTV early days.

240
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,480
Beautiful, um, hey, so congrats, uh, and, um, Natalie's a county man.

241
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,680
She, but, man, she's, she's awesome.

242
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
She's going to go places.

243
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,640
I got to tell you, um, there are people over here who have not stopped talking about

244
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,840
Natalie Delcante and her performance, uh, during the digital music awards, particularly

245
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,400
on the plus, people really, really enjoyed what she was doing.

246
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,720
She was asking the musicians came up to me.

247
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,720
The guy from, uh, Caducan, fucking guy from Caducan, okay?

248
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,600
A band called Caducan, says, hey, I, I really enjoyed what Natalie had to say.

249
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,720
She asked me some serious questions about digital rights management and was the first

250
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
kind of question that was really, you know, really good all night.

251
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,840
Right, uh, man, that's my girl.

252
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,440
And if you, uh, look at, uh, I was watching, it came through on the plus yesterday.

253
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,240
This is also, by the way, the way that I watch all of our shows.

254
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,080
Instead of, you know, uh, going through all my subscriptions, uh, it just pops up, you know,

255
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,800
I know that a new texture will eventually air on the plus.

256
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,960
So, eventually I'll see it because that's, that's how we roll, um,

257
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,160
Natalie packing her gadget bag for her trip to, uh, to London.

258
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,440
You've got to see that episode.

259
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,680
It's, it's the most natural I have ever seen Natalie be on camera.

260
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,160
And she's, and, and actually it's not very far from where she is when she's focusing on the,

261
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,920
on the tech news on camera.

262
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,200
It's just so personal.

263
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,840
I forget it.

264
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,720
I could gush all day.

265
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,520
Yes, I agree.

266
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,560
She's kicking ass.

267
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,240
So, this talk from Chicago meant to that, you know, I knew you're in town.

268
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,200
You blew through and, um, yeah.

269
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
No, I apologize about that, dude.

270
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,640
I did blow through town, uh, on the, uh, when I was, uh, going there for, uh,

271
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,640
for my presentation, I know you, you reached out to me and I just didn't have any time.

272
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,840
Uh, even if I, I did, you know, I was on the phone with Patricia back home who was feeling really

273
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,880
not well at the time, uh, so I just had no time to hang out.

274
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,400
But I promise you, I will come back.

275
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,480
I mean, I know your busy man, but, uh, hey, anytime you're in Chicago, please,

276
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,240
can't be podcast on the guy.

277
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,640
Yeah.

278
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:42,880
Yeah.

279
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,440
Yeah.

280
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,880
For Canada, here, actually I miss.

281
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,280
You could probably cruise out of here on American.

282
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,920
I should've looked you up.

283
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,360
Anyway.

284
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,400
I did, you're wrong.

285
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,120
Keep it up.

286
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,160
Rock and Bestie, uh, um,

287
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,760
challenge, folder of all that could stuff.

288
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,160
We'll fill out that.

289
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,680
I like red.

291
00:20:59,680 --> 00:20:59,760
You really.

292
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,960
I'd rather thank you.

293
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,920
I'd rather thank you.

294
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,120
There you go.

295
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,200
Lots of, uh, comparisons with the, the plus TV dot com to, uh, to old MTV, uh,

296
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
uh, but done in the, in the new fashion way with, uh, and you know what?

297
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,720
But if I had said today, oh, let's just start this, you couldn't pull it off.

298
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,640
We had to back into the big content pool, the big cesspool that is podget.com, and it's

299
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
working.

300
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,640
I'd love to hear more from you, check it out.

301
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
Let me know what you think.

302
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Hey, Adam.

303
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
So, I'm Steve.

304
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
Quick and TV question.

305
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,240
When you guys were actually on TV, seeing the George Michael video for the first time

306
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,360
you were just mentioned the other day.

307
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,360
When you're hosting, you're on the watch and TV at all.

308
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,960
Do you watch the other guys?

309
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,680
Did you watch it just my curiously?

310
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,160
You know, just to see what the other guys were doing?

311
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,520
Did you actually watch it because you liked it?

312
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
It's curious.

313
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Well.

314
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Red pill.

315
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,120
Yeah, good question, man.

316
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,680
So, when I was there, of course, this doesn't happen anymore.

317
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,960
We had segments, and we had days where we'd do a 12.

318
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,400
I'm sorry, a 24, and days where we'd do a 48.

319
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,760
So, on Monday, we would typically roll in and we'd do a 48 right off the bat.

320
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,040
Which meant we would pre-tap our segments.

321
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,480
Our segments only for Tuesday and Wednesday.

322
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,720
So, now we had facilities.

323
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,880
We had the VJ room where you could watch all the videos, prepare for your show.

324
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,640
We had research there, and that's where you'd sit with your associate producer and get ready

325
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,560
for your segments, and decide on what you're going to say in each segment.

326
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
We had a schedule.

327
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,280
So, we know, okay, I'm coming out of commercials going into, let me see, of course,

328
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,360
some new kids on the block.

329
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:46,400
I got to play some new kids on the block, I'm Choneson.

330
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,600
And then you sit there and you do segment after segment after segment, and so you'd pretend

331
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,320
that you had seen what just played, and you'd pretend that you were about to watch

332
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,600
what was coming up.

333
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:03,000
And we had an internal video system, so basically we'd schedule it in order, so if I

334
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,800
happen to be doing the afternoons, I'd come in, probably around 11 a.m., and I could

335
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:16,680
watch Julie Brown, or China, Canton, or Kevin Seale, or someone else, do their segments.

336
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,560
And so we definitely were able to watch each other.

337
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,200
We did a lot of that.

338
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,160
And then when I went home, of course, I turned it on.

339
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,680
It was back in the day when it was kind of like wallpaper, so of course, of course.

340
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,560
And then we had our new music Tuesdays, and when the new videos would come out, and

341
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,560
we'd all kind of huddle around, and we'd look at all the cool new clips when it was still

342
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,920
cool to go back in the room, and say, hey, man, I got the new aerosmith video, and we'd

343
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,960
all marvel over it, and the record company executive, where the promo guy or gal would

344
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,440
be there and be all proud, and we'd be excited.

345
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:57,760
So yeah, that's one of the things I've really enjoyed about the plus, is there's music

346
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,360
videos on there that don't just, that aren't just there because they're great songs,

347
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,720
but they're innovative and great videos as well.

348
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:14,880
So a grand experiment, so far so good.

349
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,160
My name's Matt, this is Game's Weasel, and on this week's show, the two biggest titles of

350
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,160
the year for the 360 and the PS3 go head-to-head, that's right, and Heavenly Sword is

351
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,920
taking on Halo 3.

352
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,720
Listen to what I thought of both of those at gamesweasel.btpodjo.com.

353
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:35,400
Hey Adam, I'm just listening to the DSC669, and I've got to tell you, mate, it sounds like

354
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,960
you're blue pillinous. I'm listening to your show, and it's like, you have that big

355
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,080
and of these awards, man, and big at P.U.A., it's always like a very big time to get

356
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,480
UK people to call up. So it worked, I'm calling you, blue pillinous.

357
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,800
Of course I'm blue pillinous. I do that all the time, are you nuts? I appreciate

358
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:04,440
it, man. Okay, so Friday, I believe I asked you to follow the money as your home work for

359
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,080
over the weekend, and of course I added a Monday there for you just to help out a little bit.

360
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:17,160
And really, you know, I'm trying to figure out how best to approach this subject, but what we

361
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:23,160
really need is people who are experts in finance and world governance, and well, like a

362
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:30,360
comicster blogger helps us out with the EU. There are some very interesting things going on

363
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,920
in the stock market. Gold is at a record high, yet being written about in mainstream

364
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:46,200
press as a bad investment. See what else is going on? Well, of course it's now $1.40 to a Euro,

365
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:54,120
which is just an outrageous, outrageous difference to just weeks ago, it seems.

366
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:02,840
You know, could this have to do with keeping the dollar the most attractive monetary unit for

367
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,600
for oil? I mean, there's so many different questions that come up, but there is a much bigger,

368
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:15,880
much bigger picture I believe. And Madeland did his homework, and he plucked a couple of audio

369
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:23,480
excerpts from Michael Moore's sicko, which I have not seen. I think I heard of it somewhere,

370
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,880
but I really don't know too much about it. I presume it's very similar to his previous projects,

371
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,040
but there is a great excerpt here that I want to play. Listen to this very, very carefully.

372
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,560
This is about following the money and how you can enslave people through debt.

373
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,320
I think democracy is the most revolutionary thing in the world, far more revolutionary than

374
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,880
socialist ideas, anybody else's idea, because if you have power, you use it to meet the needs

375
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,840
of you and your community. And this idea of choice, which capital talks about over time,

376
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,640
you've got to have a choice, choice depends on the freedom to choose. And if you're shackled with debt,

377
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,000
you don't have a freedom to choose. It seems that it benefits the system if the average working person

378
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,400
is shackled with debt. And people in debt become hopeless and hopeless people don't vote.

379
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:20,360
She'll say, you should ever answer vote, but I think if the poor in Britain or the United States

380
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,480
turned out and voted for people who represented their interests, it would be a real democratic

381
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,480
revolution. Now, I just want to stop that for a second, right there. Did you hear that?

382
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,200
When people get into debt, they become hopeless. Hopeless people don't vote.

383
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:44,680
Poor people don't vote. And I think the poverty line in this case is not about being able to eat,

384
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:51,880
just despair. Middle class, I would have to say, you can't just doesn't vote because they're

385
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:59,400
hopeless. They've given up. And I've said it time and time again. We have to use our system,

386
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,160
which I'll talk about in a minute, because the American system works in a very particular way.

387
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,280
I don't want it to happen. So keeping people hopeless and pessimistic. So I think there are two ways

388
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:14,120
in which people are controlled. First of all, frightened people and secondly, demoralize them.

389
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,840
An educated, healthy and confident nation is harder to govern. And I think there's an element

390
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,880
in the thinking of some people. We don't want people to be educated, healthy and confident,

391
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,560
because they would get out of control. The top one percent of the world's population

392
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,440
80 percent of the world's wealth. It's incredible that people put up with it. But they're poor,

393
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,080
they're demoralized, they're frightened. And therefore they think perhaps the safest thing to do is take

394
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:50,680
orders and hope for the best. There you go. It's been used time and time again. And I would have to say

395
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:57,800
the times we live in today look very similar to previous instances of using that type of strategy.

396
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,240
But of course, we're not really demoralized and depressed. We're fucking alive. Aren't we?

397
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,360
You open up your eyes. You've got another day. Even today where it's just raining down in buckets

398
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,360
from the heavens above. You've got to be positive. You've got to be hopeful. You've got to be

399
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,840
ready to take on the world and make a change. Every single one of you try and make a change. And

400
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:27,720
we clearly have a wonderful alternative media source to do this. So if I can get close to a

401
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,480
million people to tune in to some form of entertainment over the course of three days, I'm pretty

402
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:43,320
sure that we can start messaging people, appropriate world, if not life, if not world saving ideas.

403
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:50,840
So I certainly intend to do that on the daily source code. Now I don't get a million people a day,

404
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:59,800
but it's enough I think that can make some form of difference. Let me see. Where do we start?

405
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,720
All right. First thing, I'm starting to follow the the presidential race a little bit closer.

406
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,640
This is taking place now in the states. There's a great website. I'd like you to take a look at

407
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:18,840
opensecrets.org. You can find out for opensecrets.org exactly who has donated to each presidential

408
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,840
candidate and how much money. Of course, there are legal capsist to how much you can donate to a

409
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:31,880
campaign. I think it's just under $10,000 like $9,200 to $9,600. Now go to Hillary Clinton

410
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,480
and take a look at who's donating. And just do anything over $1,000 because the list will be too long

411
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:45,480
otherwise. And you'll see it's like 50 people from Morgan Stanley. It's all bankers. It's all

412
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,120
bad. The list just goes on and on and on and on. Which of course, to me means like, okay, Morgan Stanley

413
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:58,680
is basically backing Hillary Clinton and they're using either friendly employees or you know,

414
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:05,560
you could construct all kinds of conspiracies around why so many Morgan Stanley employees. It's listed

415
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:13,960
that way. Why they're donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Now let's go straight back to

416
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:22,040
look at the state of the dollar. Look at I'll just have to call it a bailout or semi bailout if you

417
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:28,200
look at the interest rate and how that's been working of banks on the credit crunch. It's obvious.

418
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,440
Now in the United States, you need money to become president. Hillary Clinton has already raised

419
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:41,400
75 million dollars. She projects to have $100 million by the end of the year. That's almost a

420
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:53,080
full year before the election. What is it used for? Advertising. Advertising. It's a marketing

421
00:31:53,080 --> 00:32:00,200
exercise. It is about marketing the new candidate. You know Barack Obama falling behind, you know,

422
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,320
that his campaign isn't quite, isn't quite firing in all cylinders. Why? Well, because he only

423
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:15,080
has $45 million. So I know through the power of the power of numbers, if we needed to raise

424
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,280
that kind of money for a candidate. I'm pretty sure we could if we all got behind a candidate.

425
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,960
So I believe I have to endorse a candidate for the U.S. presidential elections. I'm not quite sure

426
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,240
who yet, but I'm going to be following it very closely. Interesting that Mitt Romney

427
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,600
has put in so much of his own money. And what's up with that? I mean, he doesn't know how to

428
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:46,120
raise the money or no one believes in him. I just want you to understand that the American president

429
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:51,560
is chosen thanks to advertising. It's how we buy our washing powder. It's how we make decisions

430
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:57,960
about buying our cars. It is how we decide who will be the next president. And in effect,

431
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:04,680
still I believe, um, leader of the free world hate to say that, but it just seems to be a fact.

432
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,840
Ah, fuck it. Don't even don't even get back to me on that. That's probably not true anymore.

433
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,840
So we have to continue to follow the money. I'm going to be looking at opensecrets.org

434
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,360
to look at these donations. By the way, Barack Obama, all like individual small people,

435
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,440
interesting enough, a lot of people who have no occupation homemaker.

436
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:34,520
You just got to wonder about this stuff what that means. So as a part of keeping us in control

437
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:41,960
by terrifying us, the TSA, and I have to say airport security around the globe, apparently,

438
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:51,720
as it is in the in the United Kingdom and in Europe or Germany, is just as fucking useless as TSA

439
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:58,360
in America. Hi, and I'm hits Thomas from Arizona. On that sad story of the woman who died,

440
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,720
just a little fax to back up what. All right, well, let me just put some contacts in this if you

441
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,880
haven't heard about it. This is the woman who died in, I think, Phoenix Airport. She missed her

442
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:15,800
plane. She got really angry. She was detained. I thought by TSA employees, but it turns out it was,

443
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,400
well, you hear, it was actually Phoenix Police. And within like 15 or 20 minutes, and this is just

444
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:28,200
according to the fax that I have, she died by suffocation in her cell. Very, very strange circumstances.

445
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,800
Background to the story. It was actually the Phoenix Police who had her in custody, not TSA.

446
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,480
So, well, you can go on about your TSA related brands. It really was a separate agency who had

447
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,360
her under custody and whose responsibility it was. The other one point would be that she was actually

448
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:52,840
on her way to Arizona for drug treatment because of at least she was addicted to substance.

449
00:34:52,840 --> 00:35:00,680
Hey, let me ask you a question. Why do the Phoenix Police have a holding cell at the airport?

450
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:07,000
That's kind of interesting. It's what the local media has been saying, and that's why she was flying

451
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,240
out. But her family didn't have someone along with her if she was in such trouble, you know,

452
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,840
that kind of didn't make sense to my family and everyone who had heard the story around here was,

453
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,360
you know, how do you send somebody who's in that kind of messed up shape on a plane flag without

454
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,000
somebody along to keep an eye on them. And you know, if your family member or friend just kind of

455
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,520
seemed a little sad all the way around. Yeah. Take care. Yeah, I've been following that story

456
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,920
in the I too have read this. I think that's just the distraction away from the real question.

457
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,960
Yeah, sure. Okay. So mentally unstable on drugs, whatever. You know, the family should have been

458
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:51,400
responsible. Bullshit. I watched cops almost twice a week. I see it somewhere on TV. I see

459
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,800
drunken drugged out motherfuckers thrown into holding cells for 48 hours. You don't hear about a

460
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,720
lot of them suffocating all by themselves because of their handcuffs. Okay. Certainly not women.

461
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:10,520
So I just really did that that whole thing really, really reeks. You know, TSA did

462
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,960
did completely fuck up my bag again. Did I tell you that? It's unbelievable. They're able to break

463
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:25,400
a a supposedly indestructible to me bag. Oh, yeah. I've got my TSA lock on it. It says TSA lock

464
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:34,760
and they snip it right off. Oh, man. I really pissed me off. Luckily, I'm not alone.

465
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,960
Hey, Adam is direct from Sinia Australia. My friend just came back from Germany and while she was there

466
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,880
and Paris and a couple other places in Eastern Europe. While she was there, she sent this email

467
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,840
just before she came back about how pissed off she was at the airport security. And it's just

468
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,200
subject to the email is if you don't like a abusive language, you should probably get a church after

469
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,960
this. So I'll just read, I'll try and, you know, refrain from tuning F words and it's, you know,

470
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:08,120
capital letters and all kinds of crazy stuff here. But she's really pissed off because she just

471
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:15,400
heads the airport because and she just wants to explode. Her luggage was 51 kilos and that's when

472
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:23,080
killer over what you're allowed. So she's like, oh my god, what a big deal. But I do. Are you

473
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,680
in the bathroom taking a leak while you're recording this list? That sounds like there's water

474
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:34,040
dripping in the background. They had to pay $600 Australian just to send one of them, one of the

475
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,960
luggage, one of their suitcases back and it's going to take almost two weeks because they have to

476
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,840
send it back rather than because they're not allowed on the plane. It's freaking ridiculous.

477
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:53,080
Her mum, she writes, when they're in Germany, in the airport, they bought 125 mil bottle of

478
00:37:53,080 --> 00:38:01,560
perfume, which got 70 US dollars and you're only allowed 100 mil liquid of anything on the plane.

479
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,800
So they basically just had to throw it away and it's just, it's a power trip thing. It's just like

480
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,760
the guys just like, yeah, fuck this, we can do whatever the hell we want. Yeah, um, don't

481
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,440
fucking care what it is, whatever. And it just doesn't make sense that you buy it in the airport and

482
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:25,080
you can't figure it on the plane. Freaks. Yeah, right on to that man. So we took easy jet, right?

483
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:35,400
And leaving London, the airport has determined how big your carry on can be. And basically it's

484
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:41,160
the size of a lunch box. And ladies, please don't think you can have a carry on and a purse. All right,

485
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,960
it's for Boughton. So I had to check it. I mean, of course, I'm going for one night, right? I've got

486
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,840
my hand luggage and like, oh fuck, all this crap. It doesn't fit in the nice little rack. I mean,

487
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:59,240
I've got a sizeable carry on bag, but it fits perfectly in the overhead of every type of aircraft

488
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:05,160
that that I've flown. And I guess really it's just the inconsistency that really erks me. So

489
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,080
here we go. We're going through UK security. So I'm not allowed to take this big bag. So I take a smaller bag.

490
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:17,000
Now, all of a sudden, it's take off your shoes and the line next to me. I see people don't have to take off

491
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,680
their shoes. That would, uh, prove me to say the least coming back from, uh, from Germany, from Berlin.

492
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,360
Easy jet said, oh, no problem. Uh, you can, uh, you can put that through. That's, uh, that's a good size.

493
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:37,160
It's just one piece, right? Yeah, one piece. And he liquids. Yes, all 100 milliliters. I came prepared.

494
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:43,960
And I have them in a fucking plastic bag. So of course, uh, I have to open up my bag.

495
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:52,120
And, um, the German security officer is pulling everything out and just looking at, uh, looking

496
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,680
at all the sizes. Even the hairspray, 100 milliliters. And I said, I'm making a joke, right?

497
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,400
Said, isn't that just a troche? It's 100, look at my hair. How can I get buying 100 milliliters a day?

498
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,680
I need at least twice that amount. All done. You can take two, uh, two hair sprays of 100. Yeah.

499
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:12,360
Thank you very much. I understand. So it's 100 milliliters. She pulls out my, uh, my, my colon.

500
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,640
And on, on it, it's 150 milliliters. But it's half full. I said, look, it's only half full.

501
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,680
Oh, okay. Now, that really pissed her off. Because then she looked at my deodorant once again.

502
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:28,280
Uh, but this is 150 milliliters. It doesn't come in a smaller container. And it's a little aerosol,

503
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,880
links, right, which is acts in the US. No, you can't take that. And even worse, I had to go back

504
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,760
out to the other side of security, throw it into a, especially marked bin, which, of course,

505
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,160
these cock suckers probably empty at the end of the day and take my shit home.

506
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:51,960
Had to go through security again, just to get on the plane. Oh, by the way, didn't have to take

507
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:59,080
my shoes off. Could we at least get some consistency in this story? It's really fucking pissing me off.

508
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:06,840
It is so incredibly stupid. Consistency will make a believer out of me that you're serious about

509
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:12,760
security. I'm about to start smuggling illegal shit on the plane, just to prove that I can do it.

510
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:19,240
Because I know I can do it. I know I, I, I, I, I'm going to start doing this. I just have to because

511
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:26,760
it is making the absolutely fucking crazy. This is not making us say for it is making us a

512
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:34,280
afraid. We're in debt. We're afraid. We're being managed. We don't fucking vote. Wake up people.

513
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,800
You've been, um, and she's like, it tells me to stand pretty much soon. We're not going to

514
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,640
bring computers on planes. Because it's got numbers and letters on it. And then we were being

515
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,920
bringing a hand luggage. And in fact, you can't even bring your bones on the plane.

516
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,280
All right. I got to stop because he's just going to make me crazy. That's right. We need to come.

517
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,640
We really need to start protesting this shit. And I don't care what any politician says.

518
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:04,040
Let's do a job review of the TSA. Let's call for that. I would really like a job review.

519
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,680
Is that okay? We pay these cock suckers. We pay, and you know what? And it's not the people

520
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,720
individually. I'm sure everyone gets up in the morning. Goes to work and thinks, okay. I got a job

521
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,840
to do. I want to do my job. I want to do the best I can. But the supervision of it is so shit.

522
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:26,920
It is so inconsistent that it cannot be safer for us to travel this way. And by the way,

523
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,520
why don't we have that same shit on the train? Did they not blow up a fucking train in Madrid?

524
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:37,480
Did they not blow up buses and tube stations in the UK? Why no security there?

525
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,240
Where actual terrorism took place? Why? Because you're full of shit!

526
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:51,160
Hey Adam, Jason Sandiego. Comment on your clairvoyant. As always, curious on why clairvoyant

527
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,920
never talked to Jesus. And people think they're crazy already for talking to dead people.

528
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,880
I just want to go out with the bang and talk to Jesus, or if you want to go that eye, you know,

529
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:09,960
those are Abraham, uh, bunch of pilots, these are anyone of those guys.

530
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,120
I forget I'd like to talk to one of them. Any who.

531
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,160
Many who. All right, so what? Thank you. Thank you for changing the topic because I was

532
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,360
getting really out of control there. You're referring to Gordon Smith, spirit messenger. We're launching

533
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:30,600
his show, um, hopefully either this Sunday or next Sunday, but at least in the next two weeks,

534
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:38,760
we've already shot the pilot the first episode. And this is bone chilling. Now Gordon Smith is not

535
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:45,880
a clairvoyant, okay? He calls himself a grief counselor, but he does literally speak to the dead.

536
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:52,520
And when you see this show, it's fucking bone chilling. I'm telling you. How good he is at,

537
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:59,000
um, you know, not only passing on messages, but describing this person's personality,

538
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,480
just a lot of information without any prior knowledge, of course.

539
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,360
And I have to say that if it's really possible, this guy is doing it.

540
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:16,680
Uh, it's certainly very convincing to me. Gordon is subject of a lot of discussion right now in the

541
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,000
in the UK. And this is quite interesting the way this came together. You know, I've been talking

542
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:27,640
about Gordon Smith for, uh, if not several probably even two months now. And he's a subject of a

543
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:33,240
lot of discussion in the UK, particularly in the press because the McCain family, uh, have apparently

544
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,560
reached out to him, asked him if he would like to see if he can get in touch with, with, with Madeline,

545
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:44,920
with Maddie. Um, and he says, well, look, you know, if, if she's really dead, uh, and the parents

546
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,000
come and visit me, uh, she'll tell me exactly what happened and where she is. I know I can do that.

547
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:54,760
No problem. Boy, wouldn't that solve a lot, huh? So I'm presuming that they're actually going to do this.

548
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,960
Uh, you know, I'm presuming these parents are innocent, um, before proven guilty, obviously.

549
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:07,960
Um, so why doesn't he talk to Jesus? Well, I think there's two reasons. One is it's very hard,

550
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,920
you know, there's no, there's no other party involved. There's no one who actually knew Jesus at the

551
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,120
time, uh, and can, uh, and can say, yeah, you're right. And, you know, this is his personality. That's,

552
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:23,480
that's a good description. Um, same goes for any of the other people you mentioned. So it would be kind

553
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:31,240
of unbelievable anyway, but quite honestly, quite honestly, uh, isn't the whole point of Jesus that we

554
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:37,560
can't talk to him because he came back from the dead and he's not actually dead. Get him a question

555
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,560
for another show, perhaps. All right. One more song from the pod save music network before I head out

556
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:48,200
here, got to go to London today. I heard this one on the Jersey Todd show. And the director.

557
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:56,360
It's going to be a bit of TSA energy out there. Crash a bit, baby, baby, baby.

558
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:20,520
All the way you say, but Joe stopped recording until, month beat, huh, you want

559
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:28,200
to stop. Stop doing that week. Don't stop. Take it all the way.

560
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:39,720
Baby, baby, baby, come out and show me what you got baby!

561
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:51,560
Oh no, I don't cry.

562
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:59,560
Oh no, I don't cry.

563
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,560
This is so good.

564
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,560
I want to take it off.

565
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,560
Yes, we're scared, I'll open my bed.

566
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,560
I want to penetrate, but don't stop.

567
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,560
No, no, no, no, no, no.

568
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,560
Tell me how you want me to stop.

569
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,560
No, no, no, no.

570
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,560
Take it all the way.

571
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:29,560
Baby, baby, baby.

572
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,560
Come on, and show me what you got.

573
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,560
Baby, baby, baby.

574
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,560
Come on, and show me what you got.

575
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,560
Don't stop, honey.

576
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,560
Red or spring, and I'm trying to create it all alone.

577
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,560
Tell me just what turns you on.

578
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,560
What did you want?

579
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,560
What did you want?

580
00:47:51,560 --> 00:48:01,560
What did you want?

581
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,560
What did you want?

582
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,560
What did you want?

583
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,560
What did you want?

584
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,560
Baby, baby, baby.

585
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:26,560
Come out and show them what you got made there, made there, made there

586
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,560
Come out and show them what you got

587
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,560
Don't stop honey, what I don't promise

588
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,560
I'll try new places, I'll let it all

589
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:41,560
Tell me just what you do, what you do, what you do

590
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:48,560
Come out and show them what you do

591
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,560
Take that stick, that new TSA crack pipe

592
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:12,560
100 milliliters of bond water

593
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,560
It's good to be alive when you hear something like this

594
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:36,560
I don't hear that shit on the radio

595
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Go tuning your top 40 station for that

596
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,560
And never after

597
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,560
Before I cut out just one more TSA comment because it's so wonderful

598
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:51,560
You know I feel completely stupid right now

599
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,560
I feel like I completed it

600
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,560
And this is Scott by the way from the Alaska pod show

601
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,560
And it's I'm really tired right now

602
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,560
So just bear with me here

603
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,560
But if I just been this stupid this long

604
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,560
If I just been taking it and just completely brainwashed

605
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,560
Because you know I'm listening to this TSA stuff

606
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,560
I'm listening to raise conversations in the stories

607
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,560
You know and we're coming back from this from this shoot

608
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,560
Down in Southeast Alaska and I'm going through TSA and they make this big deal

609
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,560
About this 4.3 ounce bottle of lens clear camera lens cleaner

610
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,560
$7.99 since plus shipping and handling it's my blast bottle

611
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,560
And then we'll let me bring it on a plane

612
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,560
I can't even begin to convince them to let me keep it

613
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,560
This is a joke, it's a joke, it's refined bullshit

614
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,560
This is good as it gets

615
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,560
You know because I'm flying it at cruising altitude

616
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:52,560
And in first class and this is the first time I've flown in first class in a long time

617
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,560
Since 9.11 it's been a long time

618
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,560
Oh man how do you survive

619
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,560
And I'm flying along and I'm just like I'm really hungry

620
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,560
I get smaller food and they bring the food in front of me

621
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,560
And I'm getting a couple bites and then I look down at my hands

622
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,560
I'm like my god

623
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,560
I've got a metal fork in knife in my hand

624
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,560
And real dishes ceramic

625
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,560
Sitting right in front of me

626
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,560
I don't think I need to explain it much more here

627
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,560
But can't these be used as weapons?

628
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:24,560
And didn't they just make a big deal about my 4 ounce bottle of lens cleaner?

629
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,560
Oh man I just feel like it completed it

630
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,560
How do I go on?

631
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,560
It's a human being

632
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,560
Just to think that they think that I'm this gullible

633
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,560
I don't know

634
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,560
Hey I miss my daily daily search goods

635
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,560
But and I know you're busy man

636
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,560
Gotta pay the bills

637
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,560
I gotta pay the bills

638
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,560
So I look forward to the shows all the time and the brain food

639
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,560
And man

640
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,560
Something's gotta be done here

641
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,560
This is ridiculous

642
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,560
Take care guys

643
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,560
Bye

644
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,560
Scott man

645
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,560
You totally made my day with that

646
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,560
And I like that processing by the way

647
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,560
You sound a great on that

648
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,560
That's right

649
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,560
We're all fucking stupid

650
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,560
They're laughing at us

651
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,560
Someone is laughing very loudly at us

652
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,560
My friends

653
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,560
Follow the money

654
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,560
And we'll talk tomorrow

655
