00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
The Port City PD, the number one online police drama series, is now available.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,720
The pod father had a cameo in the season 1 finale, who will be making cameo appearances

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:20,240
in season 2, you, me, get in on the action, portcity.podshow.com.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,320
This is Bob Locksworth and we're here at the location of the UFO's sighting with Mr.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,720
William Henry.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,640
Mr. Henry was apparently taken into the spaceship and able to capture some audio of the

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
aliens.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,640
Mr. Henry.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,640
What did you find?

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,200
Well, I was abducted, and this is what they said.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:50,240
Well, I'm glad they didn't see six horns.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,240
It's dazzling, startling indeed, oh my, that is audio from the UFO.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,240
Almost for Hensley.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,240
You said that they proved you, where, where, where did they take you?

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
Where did they probe you?

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,240
Uh, up to butt, up.

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,240
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,240
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,240
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
Just take hits from the head and carry.

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
Are you crazy?

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240

I'm calling for your phone.

72
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm party party party party tonight

73
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Oh, there's no chance in time, but I can't find my food

74
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,240
Oh, now got so desperate that I sent a rocket to them

75
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,240
No, you're serious, I'm upset they saw you standing with me

76
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,240
But you're not a man, I'm not a man, they look like you

77
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,240
All the keeps on you now, this feeling's much too strong

78
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,240
My heart is ringing and I'm singing, it's fine for you

79
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Because of like you, you're like you

80
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,240
And feel it so broken in your eyes

81
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,240
You're like you, you're like you

82
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
And feel it

83
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Party party party party tonight

84
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Party party party party

85
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Cell party, I'm party party party

86
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Cell party, I'm party party party

87
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Cell party, I'm party party party tonight

88
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Jesus, thank you for sending this money to me

89
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,240
That's a way to kick off a hum day, a short skirt

90
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
No, I'm the seat-o

91
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
I'm party, I'm party, I'm party

92
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Party is a daddy

93
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,240
As we heard, the sympathy for the devil

94
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,240
And Danny Warhol's matchup a couple days ago

95
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
He said, Adam, you gotta try this one out

96
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,240
I'm pretty sure I've played this, I'll probably back at the cottage

97
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
But wow, you're here now

98
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Delta Sierra Charlie

99
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Number 640, everybody, how you doing?

100
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,240
No rain yet, my prediction still kind of holds true

101
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
It was beautiful this morning, nice and sunny

102
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,240
As I went into the second of several diva appointments

103
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,240
So that I have with my dental surgeon

104
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Yeah, I'm getting everything rebuilt

105
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,240
One last, I think, you know, I was like, I'm halfway through my life

106
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
I hope if I'm lucky

107
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,240
So I might as well fix what I can now

108
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,240
I still have money and still give a shit

109
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,240
So when I die, I'll be nothing but just some beautiful teeth left over

110
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Oh man, hey, it's good to be here with you guys

111
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Thank you for tuning in once again

112
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Yesterday, I feel really great for a number of reasons

113
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,240
We had a guy in the office yesterday in the London office

114
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
The UK Crashpad BT Pod Show

115
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,240
His name is Michael Bradford, he's an American living in the United Kingdom

116
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,240
And he works with people's energy

117
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,240
And obviously there's some interest here

118
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,240
We're looking at creating some programming with him

119
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,240
And he said, oh, Adam, do you mind if I just take a look at your energy

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
And he whipped out this

121
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Some kind of like, divining rod device

122
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,240
It was beautiful actually, he was like beautifully crafted

123
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,240
Kind of very shiny bronze like

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,240
And it looked kind of, it had, you know, like, coils on it and stuff

125
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
And it looked a bit like a divining rod

126
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,240
He said, okay, well, all right, you only have one leak in your energy

127
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Your crown chakra is blocked at 250 feet

128
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,240
And I said, oh, wow

129
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Maybe that's why I feel so good when I'm flying

130
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Because I'm above the 250 foot mark

131
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,240
And my block chakra is down there

132
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
He said, no, no, no, it's still 250 feet above you

133
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,240
I wish, of course, technically means it's illegally in the Heathrow TMA

134
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,240
That was for pilots, okay?

135
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
But he cleared me and I've got to tell you

136
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
I feel great, I went to the dentist today

137
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
And I knew I had to have some novocaine and stuff

138
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
It was in the morning, like 10 a.m. appointment

139
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
I don't, I'm not, why did I do that?

140
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
I was hating myself

141
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,240
But actually, I got in the car and I felt kind of good

142
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,240
And I went in and boom, you know, she started and did everything

143
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
And I just feel good, I feel really energized

144
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
So there's probably something to it

145
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
And that wasn't the only exciting thing yesterday

146
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Yesterday was the full blown first day iPhone test

147
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
To see how it performed

148
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,240
I was most worried about the battery performance

149
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Well, let me tell you, by its internal measurement

150
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
It actually has an internal clock

151
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,240
That starts ticking the minute it has completely charged

152
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
In fact, the minute it's charged, it stops charging

153
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,240
And then the standby time starts to roll

154
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,240
I got almost like seven hours and 50 minutes

155
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Almost eight hours of pure usage time

156
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
That was a lot of it was on the phone

157
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,240
A lot of it was spent using the Wi-Fi

158
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Wi-Fi is continuously on, of course, always searching for signals

159
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,240
I used a little bit of the quote edge network

160
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
The GPS stuff, I try to stay away from it

161
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Because of the cost, lots of text messaging

162
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
And really, it lasted throughout, you know, my day

163
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Is definitely longer than eight hours

164
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,240
But a lot of it is spent on the phone and using the phone

165
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Using the browser at least

166
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
And yesterday was a particularly heavy text message

167
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Candyman Luke, man

168
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,240
You know, it's like he knows I'm using the iPhone

169
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
And he likes to send, instead of emails

170
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
He sends me text messages

171
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,240
But they're so long they come in like five different chunks

172
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
And so beyond the phone with someone

173
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,240
Like the iPhones of vibrating against your head

174
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
So very pleased with that

175
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,240
The spelling correction, the opt-out spelling correction

176
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Is absolutely killing me

177
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,240
This is, I do not understand why they make it an opt

178
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Yeah, I understand when you're only doing English

179
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
But even then, you know, it's like

180
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Who writes the Queen's English these days anymore

181
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,240
And we all use abbreviations and stuff

182
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,240
It's a pain in the ass

183
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
That's really dumb

184
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,240
But it did kind of make me realize

185
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,240
There's a lot of falsehoods that were running around

186
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,240
About the iPod, all these so-called experts

187
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
And, you know, like, and gadget

188
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,240
And, you know, everyone who was supposed to know exactly

189
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
What was going on all the information

190
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
And one of the things was, oh, the battery life will suck

191
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Sorry, it doesn't, it's fine

192
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,240
It's certainly comparable to my E61 eye

193
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
They said it was either going to be huge

194
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Because they had a male model with big hands

195
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
And, you know, it's a great size

196
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,240
And I even heard Steve Gilmore say that, you know, the UI

197
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
And how beautiful and selected looked that was bullshit

198
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Because it was done, you know, it was television editing

199
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
And when Steve Jobs demoted it had a wire

200
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Coming out of it, of course, it had a wire

201
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
And needed some kind of video output

202
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,240
So I'd say everyone was pretty much wrong about it

203
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Now, there are, obviously, some things that I'm not too happy about

204
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
Now, I use the mobile version of Google's calendar

205
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
But I have gone through the pain

206
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,240
of setting up outlook to sync with my Google calendar

207
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,240
And then that the sync with my iPhone

208
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
And actually, that does work pretty well

209
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,240
But it's not handy because, you know, I don't want to take my laptop

210
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Everywhere I go, so I'm not getting the most updated information

211
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
My calendar does change regularly

212
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
So that's kind of a bummer

213
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
But it sounds like some other Charlie heads out there

214
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Have their iPhones and a test in them as well

215
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
So let's do a little check-in

216
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Hey, I have a message from Bucket

217
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
At Bucketpottest.com

218
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Hey, Jen

219
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
I'm calling you from my iPhone

220
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
To talk about your iPhone

221
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
And I'm wondering if you found what I find

222
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,240
To be the most annoying missing feature on the internet

223
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
You know what, Jen?

224
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
I think you should drop by one day

225
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
And we'll talk about iPhones

226
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Firephones

227
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
I found at the end of the day

228
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
When someone tried to

229
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
I'm going to say text message

230
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
A picture to me

231
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
It's not SMS, really

232
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
It's MMS

233
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Multi-medium messaging

234
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
And I got this weird little message

235
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
But I had to go to ViewMyMessage.com

236
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,240
And put in a bunch of incomprehensible codes

237
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Which I found to be seriously annoying

238
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Because here I am with what supposed to be the slickest smartphone on the market right now

239
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,240
And I can't get a multi-medium message to my phone

240
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,240
So I mean, I know you can go into email and everything

241
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
And you can email pictures

242
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,240
I haven't figured out how to view email attachments yet in like Gmail

243
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,240
But I just, I found that to be a serious lack

244
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
So that's my biggest beef with the iPhone so far

245
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Other than that, I'm actually really, really loving it

246
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,240
So if one of those is running into that, let me know

247
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
All right, bye

248
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Yeah Jen, actually I think that was predocumented before the phone came out

249
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
We knew that it wouldn't do MMS

250
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,240
And I believe that, well that has, it's the very carrier dependent

251
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
But the MMS is all fucked up anyway

252
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,240
I know that Patricia tries to send pictures to Christina

253
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
And that's incompatible

254
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
And it's a mess, it really is

255
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Here's what I do with pictures

256
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,240
I, you can do as you can email a picture

257
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,240
So what I found is it's really easy to set up an email address at flicker

258
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
That will accept pictures

259
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
In fact, you can even have two email addresses

260
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
You can send it to a different email address

261
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,240
And you know, put the subject line in there

262
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
You can even add some tags

263
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
And you can even create a blog post

264
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,240
And it'll close to right on the blog of your choice

265
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,240
So that's become a pretty simple operation

266
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Whereas like I take a picture

267
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
And then I hit the action button

268
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
And I can email it

269
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
I email it into flicker and I forget about it

270
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,240
What is disappointing is that you can set it up to sync with a folder

271
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
Your pictures and that is a way to get pictures onto your phone

272
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,240
So I synced it with my pictures in my windows set up here

273
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,240
And if I drop a picture into my pictures

274
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
It syncs to the iPhone

275
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,240
But pictures that are on the iPhone don't sync back to my pictures

276
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
That I find weird

277
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
That just makes no sense

278
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,240
So literally the only way you can now get your pictures off

279
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Is by emailing it out

280
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
It just doesn't sit right with me

281
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
But you know, at the end of the day

282
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
It's really the phone, the text messaging

283
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
And the browsing that I need

284
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Hello Adam, this is Dr. San Diego

285
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,240
I hear you got your iPhone

286
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Congratulations

287
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
I don't know if you've heard yet or not

288
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,240
But there's apparently a security leak

289
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,240
So when you are surfing on Wi-Fi

290
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Hackers have been able to hack

291
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Into the iPhone

292
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
And the phone and execute commands

293
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
Still your context

294
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
Or spam your context

295
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Yes, why?

296
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
I

297
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Yaman

298
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
Yeah, a lot of people told me about that yesterday

299
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Hey man, it's not secure

300
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
Like what the fuck

301
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
So I think what has to happen

302
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Is first that have to log into a particular access point

303
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
That is set up for this hack

304
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Then it have to go to a particular webpage

305
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,240
So there's a lot of getting me to do things

306
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,240
And I think I've heard of this hack

307
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
With the Macbook Pro is before

308
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
And yeah, sure, whatever

309
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
So I have nothing of interest

310
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
Really, I don't

311
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
And then people in my contact

312
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Well, it would be kind of interesting

313
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
I have a pretty good address book

314
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
I say I must say

315
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
And I have painfully

316
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Painfully

317
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Excuse me, hon, I'm in the middle of the show

318
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Yes?

319
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
What?

320
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Hold on a second

321
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Come up here

322
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
What are you talking about?

323
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
I'm in the middle of the show

324
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
You have no fucking manners

325
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
What?

326
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Come up here

327
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
What?

328
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
What is the pill that you gave to?

329
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,240
That's the ibuprofen

330
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
I've never seen it like this

331
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
Hold on a second

332
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
I'll show you exactly

333
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
What does that say?

334
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
And that's what was in it?

335
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
That's what was in it, yes

336
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
It's ibuprofen

337
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Oh, I've never seen it with little poles in it

338
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
No, could you?

339
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
No, tiny poles

340
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
What do you say?

341
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
I apologize

342
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
My goodness

343
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
Pardon me

344
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
And you know what I was talking about anymore

345
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,240
You have no respect

346
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
I get no respect

347
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
You don't listen to the show

348
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
You just break into the show

349
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
You're seeing it just came up to you here

350
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
No, I went downstairs and gave that to her

351
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Oh, okay

352
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Myself, personally

353
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
As you told me to do

354
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
Yeah

355
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Well

356
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Hello this nurse

357
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Good morning

358
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
And you know what I was saying anymore

359
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Ah

360
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
Yeah, yeah, goodbye

361
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Rooting my show

362
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
I'm at work

365
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
So I couldn't phone in the comment

366
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
But I figured I'd email it instead

367
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Throughout the promotion

368
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240

90 free iTunes songs

372
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,240
Mainly by getting everyone at work to collect their codes for me

373
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Plus

374
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
I won the iPod

375
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
And 10 free songs to go with that

376
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
So

377
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
For me

378
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
100 DRM free songs

379
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240

380
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
200 bucks

381
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Plus 230 pounds

382
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Which is about 500 bucks

383
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
For a new 80 gigabyte iPod

384
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
I got about

385
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,240
$665 worth out of this promotion

386
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240

388
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240

390
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240

At Liam cool

393
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
I told you

394
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
People really do win

395
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
That shit really does work

396
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
You just got to pay a little bit of attention to it

397
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Yeah

398
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
I'm out of it

399
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
I probably had some awesome thread going

400
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
That I've not completely forgotten

401
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
When I listen back to the show

402
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
I'll say oh shit

403
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
That's where Patricia came in

404
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
Let's do something different

405
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Damn

406
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
It's anti-B

407
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
I just wanted to share the good news with you

408
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
I just heard

409
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
That the chill cast

410
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
The anti-B

411
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
Is nominated

412
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
For

413
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Best produce

414
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Podsafe Music podcast

415
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
For the People's Choice podcast

416
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
I'm totally stoked

417
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
I guess the voting opens

418
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
On the 28th

419
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
So we'll see how it goes

420
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
Wish me luck

421
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
Oh yeah

422
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Also

423
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,240
You've been talking so much about your channels lately

424
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
I noticed that you have not yet added

425
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
The anti-Bvid cast

426
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
You should do it dude

427
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
And tell me how it looks on the iPhone

428
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Alright

429
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Hope to talk to you soon

430
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
Bye, baby

431
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Oh baby

432
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Congratulations

433
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
I can't

434
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
I'm thinking of coming to PMA

435
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
PME this year

436
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
If only to just hug Angie

437
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Ah

438
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Pacifico's Hellway

439
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Also nominated for an award in the comedy category

440
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Congratulations

441
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Mark

442
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
George Martin M. Cough

443
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
I never get nominated anymore

444
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
That's why I hate awards

445
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Cause I never win any

446
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
Never get fucking nominated

447
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
Something wrong with that

448
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Yeah, maybe just people aid me

449
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
Adam

450
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Allison here from Craftcast

451
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Okay, okay, I take that back

452
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Not everyone hates me

453
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Hey, just want you to know

454
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
I'm listening

455
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Listen in every day I'm out here

456
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
You are wonderful

457
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Bedside Companion

458
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
As I was recovering from a little

459
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Sheldir Surgery

460
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
So thank you

461
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Very much

462
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Learned a lot

463
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Had some time to play and look at channels

464
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
And learn all that

465
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
All VDBD exciting

466
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,240
I also put into the email here a link to yesterday's article

467
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
In the Times and the Technology section

468
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
All about how to figure out

469
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
How advertisers are going to

470
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Spend their money

471
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
How to figure out what to charge

472
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,240
And what software is in place for all that, et cetera, et cetera

473
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Anyway, it's all very exciting when you see that

474
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
For me

475
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Who's very interested in this

476
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
New media

477
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
Content

478
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Arena

479
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
To see all that happening on the front page of the times

480
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Business section

481
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
So and what else?

482
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
So I have a technical question

483
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
How do I get

484
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
My ad

485
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
In front of my show

486
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
So that no matter what show you click on any of the archives

487
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
That ad runs through

488
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
Where is that place?

489
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
Help girl out here

490
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Who's trying to learn everything from bullshit?

491
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
I'm not trying to understand what you're saying there

492
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
What are you asking for?

493
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Hold on, listen again

494
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
My ad

495
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
In front of my show

496
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,240
So that no matter what show you click on any of the archives

497
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
That ad runs through

498
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Where is that place?

499
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Help girl out here

500
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Who's trying to learn everything

501
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
So you want your ad

502
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Give me like a promo for your show

503
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Or an ad that just goes

504
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
You have to explain now

505
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
I'm sorry

506
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
It's not quite sure what you mean

507
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
If you want control over what goes in front of your show

508
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
That is something that we plan on surfacing

509
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
I think that's what you mean

510
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
But I'm not sure

511
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
I'm both in boards and reading and you my darling

512
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Anyway

513
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Just wanted you to know

514
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
I'm out here listening

515
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
And

516
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
At least someone is

517
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
I was well

518
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
And that

519
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Oh, the iPhone

520
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Yes, love it

521
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
I'm jealous

522
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
I have to tell you something funny though

523
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Eric, my son got one

524
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
So we're doing our normal video

525
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
I chats

526
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
And he wants to show me the phone

527
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
So he brings it up

528
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
To the computer to show me on I chats

529
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,240
And of course it causes major

530
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
Electronic mayhem

531
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
And everything crashes

532
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
So

533
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Anyway, I thought that was pretty funny

534
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
The

535
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
The iPhone is not user-friendly

536
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Right next to the

537
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
laptop

538
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
So

539
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Anyway, hi

540
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Big hugs

541
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
And I always look forward to hearing you

542
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Bye, honey

543
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Alright, how's it?

544
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Thank you

545
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Yeah, I've heard some other interesting things about the iPhone

546
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
If you put it into

547
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
If you put it into like a

548
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
What was I hearing?

549
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Was that on Twitter maybe that I heard

550
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,240
Someone say they had an alarm clock

551
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
With an iPhone

552
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Adapter on top

553
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
Or an iPod Adapter

554
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Of course the iPhone fits in it

555
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,240
But then the iPhone has so much RF frequency

556
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
Going on with its

557
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
Yeah, with its telephone

558
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
Built in

559
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
It turns on the alarm

560
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
That's editing

561
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
And all hours of the night

562
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Ah yes

563
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Shit does happen

564
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
I'm exact the most man

565
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
And I'm on episode 75

566
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
Of the Rock and Roll

567
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Keep Indicast

568
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
Check it out

569
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
Because you do an interview show

570
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
I'm thinking like a parody of your interview show

571
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
Like you said you do like

572
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,240
Confrontational interviews

573
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
I am Adam Curry and I'm on your show

574
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
Let's hear it

575
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,240
Let's hear it

576
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
I have with me from the popular

577
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Show of the Daily source code

578
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
And also co-founder of pod show

579
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Adam Curry

580
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Welcome to the show

581
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Oh thanks

582
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Come on

583
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
Come on

584
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Yes, but you got to get some

585
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
What do you think started?

586
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Do you do drugs?

587
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Yeah, you go

588
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
You know I do that's part of my

589
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,240
That's one of the things me

590
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
And Patricia do best

591
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
Yes

592
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
That's it

593
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Um

594
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Okay, good bye

595
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
And I'm right

596
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
No

597
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Nice

598
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
No, that's no

599
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
That's exactly how the interview should go

600
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
You should call

601
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
You should ask him one question

602
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
And say okay bye

603
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
That would floor him

604
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
He's never been done before

605
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
That would be a brilliant interview

606
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
Zach

607
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
It's okay

608
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
Bye

609
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
That would be a brilliant interview

610
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
Do you do drugs?

611
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
Okay, bye

612
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
That would destroy his ego

613
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
Man

614
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
This hair would fall out

615
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
Dude, that's the worst

616
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Oh, that's brilliant

617
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Brilliant

618
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
That's episode 75

619
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240

Michael

622
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
That's your broodus

623
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
I was that saying my hair would fall out

624
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
It's usually bald guys

625
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,240
Hello Adam here's Martin Judy from Judy's by size bonus

626
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,240
You've been talking a lot of news show about her deception on TV and radio and things in the past

627
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,240
And you asked us to confess our lot

628
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
Well, I do have a confession to make

629
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Way back in the early 80s I worked on a regional radio station in the north west of England

630
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,240
And every somewhere we used to do the roadshow

631
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,240
We're used to go out and meet and greet the people

632
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Different events throughout the north west

633
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Knowing them days as you're well know we didn't tell things like

634
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Sats like connections to the studio

635
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Just far too expensive for a small station to afford

636
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,240
So what we used to do is we used to park the shumabiel

637
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
Near a telegraph pole

638
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
You know one of those telephones

639
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,240
And then an engineer used to come on from telephone company

640
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,240
And basically hook up our broadcaster equipment to the telephone line

641
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
It then dial out to the studio

642
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,240
And stay connected all the time that we were on the shumabiel

643
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,240
To the studio so we have a live connection if you if you will

644
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
So during the show time on the shumabiel

645
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Which lasted for about three hours

646
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
I used to do five or six talk bags to the studio

647
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Reports on what was going on the show

648
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,240
Advertising everything obviously you know trying to get people down there

649
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,240
Which are on quizzes and competitions with the crowd that was there

650
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,240
And this artwork's really well, okay

651
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Once the twice we did plant the winners of the competition

652
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,240
And actually part of the production crew

653
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,240
If we can't find anything suitable really to go on the air

654
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
But it was always done live

655
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
And directly to the studio

656
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
So we used to have to mind our peace and cues

657
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
No swearing and things like this

658
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
But one particular show

659
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
We sat at the largest show we did in the summer

660
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,240
We was up to show ground called the Saint Helens Show

661
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,240
This is a big big show

662
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
In the north-west of England

663
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
Out Saint Helens like the name suggests it

664
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,240
And probably it's a couple of million people pass through the show ground

665
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Over the two days of sits on

666
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
So we then were our show reveal

667
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
All set up and it's about seven o'clock in the morning

668
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
When we suddenly realised

669
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,240
That there's no telegraph pole by the show reveal

670
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,240
We've been given the wrong plot

671
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Some sort of mad panic

672
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
We can't move anything

673
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
Because everyone else stands for all sets up now

674
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
We've got this 60 foot

675
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Our show reveal is stuck with no tractor unit to move it anywhere

676
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
So we're stuck there

677
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,240
That we know way of communicating with the studio

678
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
One of the senior producers who was on the show reveal

679
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,240
suggested that I pre-record everything

680
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,240
My interviews were the crowd

681
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
And things like that

682
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Using one of the journalists

683
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Handheld real-to-reel reporting machines

684
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
I don't know if you remember these things

685
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Used to sit at sort of they used to be strung across the show

686
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Oh yeah

687
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
And now you're at real-to-reel

688
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
I remember my phone

689
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
So that's basically what I did

690
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
So as the show was going

691
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
I was walking out of the back of the show

692
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
And we were grabbing people there

693
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,240
And we called in the pieces

694
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,240
The tape was then given to all the sectors

695
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,240
Who ran down to the main gate of the show ground

696
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,240
Which is probably about half a mile from where we were

697
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Jumped in a taxi

698
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Took that back to the radio station

699
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,240
Where they played it as life

700
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
It worked fantastic

701
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
There had never been any of the difference

702
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
All the interviews were done

703
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
All the competitions were run at the show ground

704
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Taking back to the studio by taxi and played as life

705
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
While you're well imagine

706
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
It was great to get that over and done with them

707
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
But

708
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,240
The guy that helped us purse strings at the studio

709
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
He suddenly said

710
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Must have cost us a small farting for all these taxis

711
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Back was in forwards

712
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
But when he actually worked out when it cost

713
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
It was cheaper than in that way

714
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Then it was used in the telephone lines

715
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
So of course

716
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
From there on in

717
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Every time we did a live show

718
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,240
From the show reveal

719
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
This was the method we used

720
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Every time anyone heard anything

721
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Live from the show reveal on the radio

722
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
It actually had been pre-recorded

723
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
Pulling an hour before

724
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
Taxed back to the radio station

725
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
And played there

726
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
That's my confession

727
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
Just a bit of kid oldie

728
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,240
And let's not fool ourselves though Adam

729
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Podcasts

730
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
We're no completely innocent

731
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
We all tried to fool the public

732
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
One way or another

733
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,240
We and I have one major confession

734
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,240
If only switch the effects button on my mixer off

735
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,240
You'll see that I'm actually a woman

736
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Like this

737
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,240
If you tell me exactly I'll get out my toy

738
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Your voice is so sexy

739
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,240
I get wet when I hear you die

740
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,240
This has been GD confessing all

741
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
On Adam Kelly's daily source code

742
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
Catch me five days a week

743
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
From Monday through to Friday

744
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
And by sizeburners.potgeo.com

745
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,240
See Adam

746
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
You make me so juicy

747
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
I'm going to slide right off the chair

748
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
GD

749
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Out of control man

750
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Yeah

751
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
Yeah

752
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
That's a great example

753
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
And oh man

754
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
Has the word live been overused

755
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
And incorrectly and used in deception

756
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
Really

757
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
And the thing is because it's not such a big deal

758
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,240
And you know it seems like kind of a harmless little thing

759
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
And it doesn't really make any difference to people

760
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,240
You know that builds upon builds upon things and things

761
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
And then you get to the level of where it doesn't really matter

762
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
If people enter the competition

763
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,240
But no had to had absolutely no chance of winning

764
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,240
Does it?

765
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
You know it's like an MTV

766
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
We do spring break

767
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Or any location shooter

768
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
MTV

769
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
But spring break is such an excellent example

770
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
You can literally watch it happen

771
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,240
It seems like everyone's all party and excited

772
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
And all ready to go

773
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
But all that shit's all set up

774
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
So here's an example

775
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
I'm at the pool

776
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,240
I have you know I've got to introduce a video

777
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,240
And so there's everyone's behind me

778
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,240
And the producers yelling at everyone

779
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Okay get ready for the big belly flop

780
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
And so got some guys supposed to be

781
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
You know the huge belly supposed to do a belly flop

782
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,240
And they'll count us in

783
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
And five, four, three, two

784
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,240
And then I start my

785
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
You know I start my rap and then

786
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
And then everyone goes

787
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,240
Woo!

788
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
And they're all excited

789
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
And the producers waving off camera going

790
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Yeah!

791
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
And it's all being excited

792
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
We're crazy it's spring break

793
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,240
You know it's not that it wasn't crazy

794
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,240
But it just wasn't that crazy

795
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
So yeah

796
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
Trickery

797
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
Trickery my friends

798
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
Anyway

799
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,240
From the moment you started the daily source code today

800
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,240
You probably could already smell the cheese

801
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
Because it is time

802
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
My friends

803
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,240
Cheddar by the time

804
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
You hear the show should be out

805
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
And available

806
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
It's releasing this morning

807
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
We had a couple of delay

808
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
Well actually

809
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
Why am I even giving you the update

810
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,240
But I'm bumming other day

811
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
At the office

812
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
But I'm bumming just saying hello

813
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
But I'm bumming

814
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
To the game from HQ

815
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
But I'm bumming

816
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
And pod shot

817
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Hey Adam

818
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
It's Andrew here

819
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,240
And joining me is Paulina Lue

820
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Hello

821
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
And

822
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Paulina Lue

823
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Give all of your listeners an update

824
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
On what is happening with Cheddar

825
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
I'm sure they are eagerly waiting

826
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
It's

827
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
This is Andrew Gromad

828
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,240
And Paulina

829
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,240
Why do I think I have a met Paulina

830
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Hmm

831
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Sounds hot

832
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Here it's on our

833
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,240
www.podshow.com

834
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,240
And we had

835
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
The best of intentions of getting

836
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
It live this afternoon

837
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
And

838
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
We're running a little bit late

839
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,240
We've had some very interesting issues

840
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
With the power

841
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
This has to do with

842
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Which you all may have read about

843
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,240
I think the rumor is that

844
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,240
Some drunk employee went nuts

845
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
And kept unplugging

846
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
And replugging the

847
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Powerswitch

848
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
Which isn't Paulina man

849
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,240
There's talent in the engineering department

850
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
I don't know about

851
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
It sounds better than those

852
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Those witches over at scene

853
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
That's for sure

854
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
Nice Paulina

855
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
Welcome

856
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
For Cisco

857
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Yeah

858
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
It's a great image

859
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,240
It's kind of an interesting

860
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Each time the power went

861
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Ah, you would hear these grow

862
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,240
And from the office

863
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
And it would be back on again

864
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,240
And off for five minutes

865
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
But we cannot fully blame

866
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,240
The fine city of San Francisco

867
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,240
We encountered a number of bugs

868
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,240
You know, not major deep issues with the system

869
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
But small things

870
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Inevitable

871
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,240
Bugs that

872
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,240
Come up when you merge code

873
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,240
Between several different developers

874
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
And also lots of little finesse

875
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
As you saw

876
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,240
We lovely

877
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
White on orange

878
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
XML buttons

879
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,240
That appeared

880
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
So late in the game

881
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
Thanks to Paulina

882
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,240
So

883
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,240
So we also spent a good chunk of the day

884
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
When we did have power

885
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Squashing out those last bugs

886
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
So the current status

887
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
Which I'm sure you've all been waiting for

888
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
As of today

889
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,240
We're just looking over the issues

890
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
There are a couple of

891
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
Essentially

892
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Display level

893
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Styling issues

894
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,240
That we're trying to get really finesse

895
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
And working across all the browsers

896
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
And the nice consistent way

897
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
But we are hoping

898
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
I just sent out an email

899
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
Which you probably saw at

900
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
I just sent out an email

901
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,240
Identifying the last couple of nagging issues

902
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,240
Pitching that we have our

903
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Go-no-go meeting

904
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
That is just kind of a final say

905
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,240
On the status and stability of the build

906
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,240
And once we have that meeting

907
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
I think should slow up

908
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,240
So we're open for some time tomorrow morning

909
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,240
And I would just ask everyone

910
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,240
To keep their eyes on the site

911
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,240
And we're getting it up

912
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,240
As quickly as we can

913
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Anything to add to that, Paulina

914
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Nope

915
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,240
We're just trying to work out

916
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
All of the

917
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
There's always

918
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
There's always some problems between

919
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,240
The IE and the PC and FireFox

920
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
And that's kind of what we're running

921
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,240
That's kind of what we're running

922
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,240
IE

923
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,240
IE

924
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
And it's always just like that

925
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
IE

926
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
I've actually threatened

927
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,240
To people complain too much about the style

928
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
Issues and IE have actually threatened to

929
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,240
Make them work on a five year old

930
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
10 pound

931
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Windows laptop

932
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
I've done it

933
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,240
And you're never going to make me do that again

934
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,240
You'll pry this pretty little neck out of my cold dead fingers

935
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,240
Okay

936
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,240
So don't even try

937
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,240
That update from HQ

938
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
We're like I said, we're going to push forward

939
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
And try and get this thing out

940
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,240
And a nice clean polished way

941
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,240
For everybody to get their hot little hands on

942
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
Sometimes tomorrow that would be

943
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Wednesday

944
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
July 25th

945
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Day to mark in history

946
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
So

947
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Is that day to get their food

948
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
That's right

949
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
What was it?

950
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240
What were we saying?

951
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
The cheddar was flowing like

952
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Moulton lava

953
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
That's right

954
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,240
It makes your pot experience flow

955
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,240
Your pot experience

956
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Oh

957
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
All right guys.

958
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Signing off then

959
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
I will be listening to the show

960
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
And eager to hear everyone's feedback

961
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Thanks

962
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,240
Thank you

963
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Andrew Paulina

964
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
Two hot geeks high on cheddar

965
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,240
You know the you guys got to show there

966
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
Andrew you your your your

967
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Your modulations a little low

968
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
Paulina you've got a fantastic voice

969
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
And you guys could talk geek

970
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,240
Paulina you could talk geeky stuff in my year all day long

971
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
But I'm bummer the day at the office

972
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,240
But I'm bummer just say hello

973
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,240
But I'm bummer to the game from HQ

974
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,240
But I'm bummer and pod show

975
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Yeah, you thought that's always get from pod show

976
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
No, no, no, no because apparently

977
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,240
And this is pretty interesting

978
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,240
These guys I guess signed off on

979
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,240
On on the engineering and then it goes to something called

980
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,240
QA the QA department quality assurance

981
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
I presume

982
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
Headed up by shriek hunt now shriek

983
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
You got to kind of reset your ears because shriek hunt

984
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
Speak with an accent

985
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
But I love this

986
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,240
I love what he sent in

987
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
It's awesome shriek hunt you're up man

988
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,240
Hello Adam this is shriek hunt

989
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
QA got a pod show

990
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,240
Today we need Andrew mention that you want audio comments

991
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,240
For chatter from engineering

992
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,240
And Andrew chose me to do that

993
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Which I think was a very long choice

994
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Because you cannot get QA guy to talk good about anything

995
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
But I will try to

996
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,240
So this new feature we call it channel editor

997
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,240
Also term as pre-dater or chatter

998
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Is a really cool feature

999
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,240
This feature enhances user experience

1000
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,240
For channel creation and manipulation

1001
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,240
That's it right there

1002
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,240
It increases user experience for channel creation and manipulation

1003
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,240
Spoken like a true QA god

1004
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,240
A new channel will enable users to create new channel

1005
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Mentor items in the channel

1006
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,240
Rear the items in the channel with ease and in a very user-friendly manner

1007
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,240
User can just drag and drop the items from the collection

1008
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,240
Out to 24 items into the channel

1009
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,240
And they will get the instant channel

1010
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,240
User can also define the depth of the playback

1011
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,240
For episodic shows in the channel

1012
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,240
The user can decide whether they want to play only

1013
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Let us episode or last two episode or last three episode

1014
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,240
Or they can even decide to skip the show

1015
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,240
From the channel without playing any episode

1016
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Nice

1017
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,240
Okay, so that was a speech

1018
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Now I'm going to put my cue hat

1019
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,240
And

1020
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
Now comes the QA hat

1021
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,240
Now he's going to tell us all the shit that doesn't work right with

1022
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,240
Cheddar because I'm crude behind the lies

1023
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,240
So this feature is not yet fully cooked

1024
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,240
And still need few enhancements

1025
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,240
First of all, we can handle only up to 24 items in the channel

1026
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Which means if user create a new channel

1027
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,240
They can have only up to 24 items in the channel

1028
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,240
Okay, let me just make sure I got this

1029
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
So I have seen this

1030
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
So when you're creating a new channel

1031
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
You can put up to 24 items

1032
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
That could be 24 shows

1033
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
So I think it's going to be sufficient just for us to get started with

1034
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,240
No idea why the limit

1035
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Certainly no idea why the limit is 24

1036
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
But it doesn't matter

1037
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
That's what tree contest for it

1038
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
Point to point that out

1039
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
Thank you

1040
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
QA god

1041
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Well then that

1042
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,240
Second

1043
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,240
To the order of the item

1044
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
In the old channel

1045
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,240
Which are not edited using this new feature

1046
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,240
And if the user tries to play the channel

1047
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
From edit my channel GUI

1048
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,240
Then the playback order of the items in the channel

1049
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,240
We'll not be the same as it appears in the GUI

1050
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,240
Okay, I got it

1051
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,240
So if you already have channels in Pod Show

1052
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,240
Their behaviour will not be affected by this cheddar release

1053
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
I presume not until you've actually edited the channel

1054
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,240
And to work around this issue

1055
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
What user has to do is

1056
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
Then it to open the old channel

1057
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,240
Using new edit my channel GUI

1058
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,240
Either we order or add new item to the channel

1059
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,240
Which will force the channel to say

1060
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,240
And then the items in your old channel

1061
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,240
We'll also play in collect order

1062
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Right

1063
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
So over the other two

1064
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
So basically all you have to do

1065
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,240
If you want to convert your old channels to new

1066
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,240
Cheterize the channels with molten cheddar cheese

1067
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Then you have to go in and edit your channel

1068
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,240
And presumably maybe just change an order or something

1069
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Or click on a depth setting

1070
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Or just do one little change it will save automatically

1071
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,240
And of course then all your channels will have the default

1072
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
Depsetting of one

1073
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,240
All the shows in the channel

1074
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
I think

1075
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
Channel

1076
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,240
We'll also play in collect order

1077
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,240
So overall this feature is great

1078
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,240
And thanks to Andrew and his team for putting this together

1079
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,240
And also I would like to thank my Q8 team members

1080
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
For doing such a great job

1081
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
Thanks

1082
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,240
No, thank you guys

1083
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,240
It should be savanche recont

1084
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
That's it

1085
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Because you guys truly are savants

1086
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
I can't wait

1087
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
I can't wait

1088
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
You guys will be having your weedies

1089
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240
And I'll be sitting here waiting for the cheddar to come out

1090
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,240
So it's happening today

1091
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,240
I think we'll have plenty of time to be playing with that tonight

1092
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
And talking about it tomorrow

1093
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
Hey Adam

1094
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,240
I'm the guy who called in today's go about the channels

1095
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,240
And I just heard your reply

1096
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,240
And whatever, my name is Steve

1097
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,240
I don't have a really awesome handle

1098
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
I don't know

1099
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
Anyway

1100
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,240
Yeah you do your savanche Steve of course

1101
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,240
The action is I've got a stop calling in when I'm fascinated

1102
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,240
I sound like a smack touch

1103
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,240
Maybe you like that

1104
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
You know my problem is that I'm still using juice

1105
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,240
Maybe I'm just my issue

1106
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,240
As I got to go back over to iTunes and use that as the pod catcher

1107
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,240
I had a bad experience when they first released the pod

1108
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,240
Podcast catching feature

1109
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,240
I think it blew away but you might

1110
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,240
I don't know

1111
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,240
You did something bad

1112
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
Stop using it

1113
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,240
Went back to juice works

1114
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
But it sounds to me like

1115
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
That's my issue

1116
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Well of course

1117
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,240
That seems to show that I

1118
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
A couple days ago when I actually left the message

1119
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,240
I kept listening to the show and you actually were talking about

1120
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,240
The iPhone or the listening live and I suddenly realized

1121
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,240
Well

1122
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,240
Yeah that's it

1123
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
It's just

1124
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Kering things around in a hard disk

1125
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
Come on I pod

1126
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
I think a lot of sense

1127
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,240
If you could connect it to that full time

1128
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Then the roots of the whole issue

1129
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
Yeah eventually

1130
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,240
That's really the future here

1131
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,240
That we're getting toward

1132
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Anyway

1133
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,240
Later

1134
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,240
Yeah I think we definitely will get there

1135
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
Always on always connected

1136
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
Wirelessly all the time

1137
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
So you'll know that cheddar has been released

1138
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,240
If you go to atom.podshow.com

1139
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
You'll see my channel module right there

1140
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
Front and Center in the page

1141
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
And if it has a little

1142
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,240
New drop down box that says

1143
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,240
Choose player

1144
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,240
And from that you can choose multiple players

1145
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,240
There's also a put it on my iPod option

1146
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
And you'll actually see a little

1147
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,240
White and orange RSS button

1148
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
That'll work for juice

1149
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,240
Just copy that link right into juice

1150
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
And your channel will work in juice

1151
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
No problem whatsoever

1152
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
Satisfaction guaranteed

1153
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,240
If you and you can do that without a pod show account

1154
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
If you do have a pod show.com account

1155
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,240
Then you'll be able to go to your profile

1156
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Click on edit channels on your edit

1157
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
On your channel module

1158
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,240
Or in the master control

1159
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
And you'll be able to edit your channels

1160
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,240
Create new ones

1161
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
And I would say let the fun begin

1162
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,240
Out of a steal again

1163
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,240
I just had an idea

1164
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
And I'm wondering if you guys have thought about this

1165
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
It's a long commute

1166
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,240
I just sit here and think

1167
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
Um

1168
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
Do you plan to make it so that

1169
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
You inspire

1170
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,240
Importing somebody else's channel

1171
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
Or going, hey, I like that channel

1172
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
I want to subscribe to it

1173
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
What if you made a template

1174
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Somebody else's channel

1175
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
Used it as a starting point

1176
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,240
Somebody getting into this

1177
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
Might

1178
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
Take a look at a channel

1179
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
Take those shows

1180
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
Look appealing or I heard this one already

1181
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,240
If this is the rest, look at your single

1182
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,240
I'd like to try that one

1183
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
And then later me want to customize it

1184
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
Is there?

1185
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,240
I didn't hear it

1186
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
I'd not heard you talk about that

1187
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,240
To me that scene is like

1188
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
A pretty likely way

1189
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Somebody might use it

1190
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,240
So just to find

1191
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,240
Yeah, Steve, you know

1192
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
Brilliant minds think alike

1193
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,240
I can't say that I'm one of the brilliant

1194
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
Minds in this case

1195
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,240
That will be a part of the get channel

1196
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
Functionality

1197
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Which a lot of it is already working

1198
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,240
But we're going to hold off on that

1199
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
And first we're going to just

1200
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
Get through editing and creating new channels

1201
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Seeing how that works

1202
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,240
You know I have no idea how it's going to work for everybody across the board

1203
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,240
So let's take it in little incremental steps

1204
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
What will release right after that

1205
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
Or maybe two weeks from now

1206
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
Depends on when we feel it's right

1207
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,240
Is the ability to get a channel

1208
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,240
So you can subscribe to someone's channel

1209
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
And you'll be able to do three things with it

1210
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,240
One is you'll say just

1211
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Get this channel

1212
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
And put it into my collection

1213
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,240
So you can drag it into another channel

1214
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,240
Set a depth and treat it just like a show

1215
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,240
That'll be one way

1216
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
There's another way

1217
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,240
We can say get this channel

1218
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,240
But don't get the channel

1219
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,240
Please just explode the contents of that channel

1220
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
Into my collection

1221
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,240
So I'm subscribed to them

1222
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,240
And I can put them into other channels

1223
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Individually

1224
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
And the third which is what you're talking about

1225
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
Is

1226
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
Subscribe to this channel

1227
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
So it will actually show up

1228
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
As a template

1229
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
In your channels

1230
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,240
With the name and everything that

1231
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
Was the original template of that channel

1232
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,240
It's in fact exactly what you're talking about

1233
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Steve

1234
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
I have a couple of questions about that

1235
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
Because I'd like to have two versions of it

1236
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,240
Both versions need to have attribution towards the

1237
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
To the creator

1238
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
Whoever created the channel

1239
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,240
I mean you want to be able to find that person

1240
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
That should be trackable

1241
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
And the other one is

1242
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
I'd like to be able

1243
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,240
To subscribe to that channel as it is

1244
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Have it in my channel module

1245
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
But have someone else

1246
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
You know the originator be controlling it

1247
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
So I don't have a copy of it

1248
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,240
A template or a clone

1249
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,240
It's really just like an alias or symbolic link

1250
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,240
That is just sitting there

1251
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,240
And that will change

1252
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,240
Even if someone takes it

1253
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,240
If the creator takes a show out

1254
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
That will be reflected in my version of the channel

1255
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,240
So that's all coming

1256
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,240
That's all part of the get channel functionality

1257
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,240
Baby steps my friends

1258
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
Let's just start off with the big steps first

1259
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,240
All right

1260
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,240
40 minutes

1261
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,240
On the long side today

1262
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,240
But had a lot to go through

1263
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,240
I got a wonderful

1264
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
iTunes gift certificate today

1265
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,240
In the email

1266
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,240
From Brian Know

1267
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
50% of the production guys

1268
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,240
He MPed up

1269
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
Are the production guys Adam

1270
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
And here comes a quote

1271
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,240
I get the news I need on the weather report

1272
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
A song about a pilot

1273
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,240
For the next time you're an NYC

1274
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,240
From the society

1275
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
For the preservation of the soundtrack

1276
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
To our lives

1277
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,240
Thanks man, I appreciate the present

1278
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,240
It's a play that I'm done

1279
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,240
But I know you're part of the more fun

1280
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
For the next time you're an NYC

1281
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,240

For the next time you're an NYC

1285
