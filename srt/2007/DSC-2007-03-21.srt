1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
Time shifting is so cool, you right now are listening to the DSC 566.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,160
The show may be recorded at night, in the morning, in the afternoon, it doesn't matter.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,240
It could be recorded in San Francisco, New York, the UK, anywhere across Europe, even

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,480
in a plane going across the Atlantic, doesn't matter to you, you're consuming it in

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,880
your present.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,720
It's recorded live, it's a live person talking live into a mic and you're listening

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,720
to it live.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,520
So it's pretty live.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,480
But you know, it's just time shifting is cool, podcasting is cool.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,520
So enjoy the DSC 566 and if you are listening to this honor before March 22nd, bum

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,080
rush the charts.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,120
By the black lab song on iTunes, make a go to number one and show what podcast you can

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
do.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,120
Again, enjoy your time shifting.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,640
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,240
radio content in my ears.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,040
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:10,040
You're hanging around the club, baby, every night.

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,440
She was thinking a little bite, got you knowing right, you're like a baby, you're

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,440
all around.

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,480
You know, if I can hear it, you're like put you down.

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,040
I teach you real life, I can keep you flat as fast, but you do, you're chasing all

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
the outside.

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,720
Where the fuck are babies they can't see, you'll see the teacher, mama, oh, you're cheating

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
on me.

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,800
Oh, baby, oh, we're gonna keep you, we're gonna keep you, we're gonna keep slow, you're

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,320
got a repaid and a broken heart, you're looking a little mama, but you're

28
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,920
ain't you smart, you're like a house, you're like a little woman, I know, you're

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,560
like put me up in the future, get your best show.

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,760
Oh, easy, easy.

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,100
You're gonna be my joke and you're sweet, you're you mama, oh, you're cheating on me.

32
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,120
Oh, I make a cheating game.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,800
Oh, baby, oh, we're gonna keep you.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:27,780
Oh, baby, oh, we're gonna keep you, we're gonna keep you, we're gonna keep you.

35
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:57,780
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:27,780
You, yeah, you always stay, you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love love you, I love you, I love you, I love your

37
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,620
You know, you just don't hear enough of that kind of music on the radio.

38
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,260
That's why I played for you.

39
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,620
Mark LaFourmei, I'm going to guess.

40
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,060
Two true mama from the Pod Save Music Network.

41
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,580
You know, I'm just scouring around, looking at the top 10 most pod plays of the week,

42
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,460
and that showed up, I'm like, okay, okay, off to the playing it is then.

43
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,460
Everybody, how you doing?

44
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:53,620
It's a daily source code 566 for Wednesday, the 21st of March 2007.

45
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,020
Technically, we're into Wednesday, the 21st, although it's actually still Tuesday night.

46
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,420
I was in the city all day.

47
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,260
If you remember from yesterday's show, I kind of hurried the lady Patricia along.

48
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,020
So I could run off to my meeting with Gavin.

49
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,460
So it's still Tuesday in the US when I'm doing this.

50
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,820
It's Wednesday in the UK, and I think it's April 18th in Australia.

51
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,700
Something like that.

52
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,020
It's guys are always ahead.

53
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,340
I can never figure it out.

54
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,700
So anyway, rushed off to the city, do my meeting, which was great.

55
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,300
It's always fun to catch up with Gavin.

56
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,140
It's kind of weird though, you know, and now I've been to his house, so I have like a personal

57
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,580
relationship with the same time and professional relationship.

58
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
Whoa.

59
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,980
Oh, man.

60
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,220
It was, you know what I mean?

61
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,980
It's like one of those things.

62
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,180
I shit he's younger than I am with the hell of my talking about.

63
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,820
So that was, you know, actually, there's something that we haven't talked about.

64
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,940
Have I ever talked about Pod Show TV because that's something that is really ramping

65
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,740
up pretty quickly.

66
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:05,980
And it's a whole new way of looking at Pod Show and how you interact with media, how

67
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,220
you collect things.

68
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,420
Of course, it's all done through a remote control.

69
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,380
And the cool thing about this is, you know what, IP, IP TV, you hear about it all over

70
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,380
the place.

71
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:21,620
It's kind of like, it's almost a ubiquitous name for watching television coming over

72
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,900
tubes, a series of tubes, better known as the interwebs.

73
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,180
Now British telecom actually has an IP TV product in the market.

74
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,780
I think they've got, you know, a couple thousand people now in the first stages of the test.

75
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,980
And it really is a set top box is what it is, except instead of the television signals

76
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,380
coming through the cable, it's literally coming through the other wire that comes into

77
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,380
your house.

78
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,420
Pretty interesting stuff is now you see companies like British telecom competing with

79
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:54,940
companies like Comcast or in the UK, we'd say NTL, which of course is NTL, but it's

80
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,500
kind of a joke because they suck so bad.

81
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,420
Actually, that's virgin media now, I should say.

82
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,460
Oh, man, I don't want to go off on that.

83
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,580
We'll talk about that tomorrow, but virgin media.

84
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,180
Anyway, so this poncho TV, it works on a couple different platforms.

85
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:19,500
So the set top boxes, they run, I think, a version of Windows CE, but the interface

86
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,580
is very similar, if not almost precisely the same as the basic interface on Windows Media

87
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,580
Center Edition.

88
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,460
You may have a PC that already has media center edition.

89
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,500
It's very much like the iTunes 10-foot interface, what are they called front row?

90
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,780
Where you have a menu system and here's the stuff you can choose from, you know, pictures,

91
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,860
music, bloody, bloody, bloody, bloody, and you hook it up to your TV and you have some kind

92
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,780
of Microsoft version of an experience.

93
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,980
So we built an interface that goes right on top of that.

94
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:55,180
And so this fits not just on the CE-based IPTV platform, but we're probably going to roll

95
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,900
it out first as something that you actually download and install and then works right with

96
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,620
your Windows Media Center Edition.

97
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:08,020
It's extremely cool shit because you can essentially be programming your channels from

98
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,020
anywhere, you know, from the office or anywhere you are that you have a web browser so

99
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,060
that could be in a mobile as well.

100
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,300
I've got to verb something awesome, but it's still not happening at the wrong time.

101
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,300
I kind of like doing this stuff at a different time.

102
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,300
You get into a very different mode, so particularly after a day like today, so it was very,

103
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:37,740
it was very exciting to talk about some of that and I think that within, I'm going to say

104
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,660
a couple of months, we might be able to release something that you could just download

105
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,700
and install and run on your Windows Media Center Edition, it's pretty cool stuff.

106
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,740
Let's see, there was a reason I was saying that, oh, I know.

107
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,980
So along with all of this development in the United Kingdom as we continue to move forward

108
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:05,220
with our partner British telecom, I said this before, it looks like we're going to be doing

109
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,660
something in Germany and it was pretty funny.

110
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:16,500
There was a meeting that took place last Friday at Seabit and that's in Hanover in Germany.

111
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,660
Germany and since we were kind of stretched between multiple places, we had all the

112
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:28,100
sales stuff we're doing in New York, Ron and Head Sales Weasel, Chris Jacob went over to

113
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:34,300
Hanover, they did the meeting and I think I did mention this on the show actually because

114
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,500
a comic strip blogger sent me a note and he said, hey, it's just a hop skip and a jump

115
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,100
from me to head and over to Hanover and interview Ron Bloom and we were like, yeah, cool.

116
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,820
Well, you could definitely interview Ron.

117
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,260
I don't think it worked out because of timing, it was all messed up.

118
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,620
There was actually no hotel left in Hanover, so Ron was like taking the train back

119
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,300
and forth and Berlin, whatever.

120
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,340
So that didn't work out as too bad because, you know, one of these days, we will eventually

121
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,420
actually get to meet the infamous comic strip blogger.

122
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,300
I'm so looking forward to it.

123
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,900
So the reason why I'm taping the show tonight is because we have an agency presentation

124
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:16,260
tomorrow because all of a sudden it's heating up now in the UK and we have an awesome opportunity

125
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,740
to present to McCann Erickson.

126
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,980
We've already been doing a lot of work with them.

127
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,740
They are the agency for a lot of the Johnson & Johnson brands in the state, so being

128
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,180
you know, explained as one of theirs, obviously.

129
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,060
So being doing some work with them and so the UK side should be pretty interesting.

130
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,900
And then tomorrow afternoon, it's really it's full days here.

131
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:43,820
Tomorrow afternoon we have, I think a whole bunch of producers slash podcasters who are

132
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:50,580
on the network on btpodshow.com, on the bt side, the UK side, even, I think our buddy

133
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:56,820
from Germany is coming in and does the tips from the top floor, somehow he's signed

134
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,820
through the UK division, you must like those pounds, I don't know, and so it's going

135
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,820
to be cool.

136
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,860
We're going to have a pretty big meeting and we're going to talk about some campaigns that

137
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,060
are coming up and the stuff that we learned about how to promote shows and how to promote

138
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,940
cross network and that's going to be exciting, but so there you go, that's the reason why

139
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,300
I'm up at, you know, past midnight, way past my beauty sleep bedtime, bringing you the

140
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,300
show.

141
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,540
Then we got some cool stuff to listen to and to talk about.

142
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,260
Let me just see, this is something I, I caught through a blog post that Andrew Grummit

143
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,260
had made on his weblog.

144
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,940
Now, I'll put a link to Andrew's blog and also a link to this particular piece.

145
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:42,740
I believe it's, of course, I forgot the page that I got it on, now I should have put

146
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,940
it in the show notes.

147
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,700
I think it was at Stanford University and so it's my partner, co-founder and CEO of

148
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:56,180
Pacho Ron Blue, in a question and answer session with one of our members of the board

149
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,260
of directors Ray Lane who was also a partner at Clienter Perkins.

150
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,220
So what's nice about this, and it's about an hour, so I listened to half of it on the

151
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,380
way and half it on the way back, it's a moderated session and it's really about the

152
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:21,100
relationship between an investor and a company or someone who took investment, how we

153
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,020
came together, what decision making process went through both parties to take investment,

154
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,820
to make investment, what the ongoing relationship is like and it's really great because

155
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,340
the setting was so calm and relaxed and both Ron and Ray are really, you know, I was

156
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:42,340
listening to it in smiling because I'm like, yeah, this is exactly it, this is really right.

157
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:48,100
So if you want to know more about the people, kind of the silent partners, if you will,

158
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,940
of Pacho and how they're thinking and what they believe in, you definitely should listen

159
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:58,180
to this and it's kind of funny because I want to play a little bit of it because you hear what

160
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,700
was the question, I think, oh, it's background, how did you get from wherever you started to

161
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,100
hear? And I'm actually going to play the piece where Ray Lane talks about his background and

162
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:17,780
how he went from a kid in Pittsburgh to one of the arguably most powerful men in the venture

163
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:25,620
capital business and then Ron will also give his background and then Ray does something really

164
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,420
interesting and I'm not quite sure what his point was, but I know he listens to the show.

165
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:36,580
So let's try and figure out what he was trying to do in this piece. I'll give you the piece of

166
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,220
the moderator first. It's good listening and if you're not interested, fast forward.

167
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,580
You both have had really interesting and exciting careers and instead of my introducing you and

168
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,100
sort of telling a story that probably isn't so accurate, I'd love each of you to tell a little

169
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:59,940
bit of background of how you went it up on this stage here. How long do you have? As long as you

170
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:08,180
want. Yeah, I'm going to go first. So I've spent my entire career in technology.

171
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:15,060
Born and raised in the East Coast grew up in Pittsburgh, educated in Pittsburgh and West Virginia

172
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,540
went to West Virginia University in Carnegie Mellon. I still have an association with Carnegie

173
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:26,180
Mellon today, I'm on their board of trustees. So I'm a router for Carnegie Mellon.

174
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,300
By the way, Ray. Ray, dude. We've got to do something about the bio, man. I mean, that's kind of

175
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,620
bland sounding. West Virginia, man. That's like there's a lot going on in West Virginia.

176
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,580
You know, we've got to sex it up a little bit. No. And stand for partnerships. If we can

177
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:51,220
generate them. Yeah, yes, I played James Bond for a couple of seasons. But focused early on computer

178
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:58,100
science technology, IBM, EDS, spent 12 years with Booz Allen as a senior partner. Hey, you got to

179
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,100
spend spend years boozing with Allen. That's good. Now you're sexin it up. That's good.

180
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:08,500
They're running the information technology practice and then I spent eight years as president of

181
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:16,900
Oracle. And I left Oracle in 2000 and joined the Cliner Perkins and have been for the last six

182
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:24,500
and a half years investing in startup companies in information technology software primarily

183
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:32,420
services and in clean tech. So it's an interesting new area for the venture industry

184
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:40,020
and in Cliner Perkins is in the last several years really focused on that say 40% of our resources

185
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:48,260
and now focused on clean tech. Making investments in solar companies and electricity generation

186
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:55,460
and storage in biofuels. And then I'm on a board of a coal gasification company that produces

187
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:01,380
natural gas to the pipeline by gasifying coal and a single step. So yeah, it's really interesting.

188
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:08,260
When when we met Ray, I'll just interject here for a second. He was like, yeah, you know, an

189
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:16,260
Oprah and Robin Williams and Bono's investment and Rob Reiner, not Rob Reiner. Yeah, Rob Reiner,

190
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,540
you know, it's like all these celebrity names, you know, and I was like coal gasification, Ray.

191
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:28,260
That's the shortest I can do it for that amount of time. Great. So Ron,

192
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:37,700
about 180 degrees opposite of Ray, I was raised in Atlanta and tended Georgia State University,

193
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:44,820
the study philosophy, but my early career was as a musician, written and produced over 300 songs

194
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:50,580
that have been published, played on over 2000 albums and began to get interested in technology.

195
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,660
After building a couple of recordings, studios, my last one, I built with Chuck Norris as a partner

196
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:01,700
Los Angeles and building that studio. I came upon this technology called Fast Fourier Analysis,

197
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,940
which is now called Sampling through the uninitiated and Fast Fourier Analysis.

198
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,980
Isn't Fast Fourier Analysis a show at a pod tech.net?

199
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,580
And realize that we could use the internet to exchange files as we were trying to develop this software

200
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:20,180
and I discovered what software was as a musician and that I needed it as to help me with my tools.

201
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:28,260
I sold my studio. I heard about this thing called the internet and decided to create a concept called

202
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:35,300
CybroKass and the idea of a CybroKass came from a thought that I had that somehow the internet television

203
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,340
and radio could work together to create information and entertainment rather than one displaced the other.

204
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:47,540
This was in 1994. I needed a project in order to demonstrate how a CybroKass might work so I

205
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:53,060
had worked on some Grammy projects as an artist. I convinced the guy who fell around the

206
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,820
Grammys at that time, my green to go ahead and give me the license to create a CybroKass for the Grammys.

207
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,940
Asked around if anyone else knew what the internet was and you'd be surprised in 1994.

208
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:10,180
How many people said no? I found the guy who had just left MTV as name was Adam Curry, VJ.

209
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:15,300
No, no, no, hold on a second. I want you to hear what listen to what happens next.

210
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,580
Now, Ray is going to do something that I just don't understand what he's trying to prove.

211
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,860
But have a listen. Yeah, and a VJ and a guitar player put together a company to CybroKass the Grammys in

212
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:32,500
94. Just for fun. Yes, for fun. How many of you have heard of Adam Curry?

213
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,060
I was hoping to be none of you. Yeah, see, see a whole bunch of hands went up. That's what happened,

214
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,020
Ray. And then, and then what?

215
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:51,140
Even he's getting too old for this population. Oh, okay. I get it. It's he's trying to show

216
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,300
that all these young people don't know me. And then I'm over the hill. Is that it, Ray?

217
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,380
Round again. We get reused like that bio energy.

218
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,180
This might be just an interesting question. All right anyway. So you should take I have no idea what Ray was doing.

219
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,900
I think he was just trying to mess with me. So the next board meeting, he like pull out this tape and go,

220
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,620
or this recording, go, ah, ah, you think you're all that shit. You're nothing.

221
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,580
So as venture capitalist man, they'll do that to you time and time. Again, got to watch your back.

222
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,100
So definitely check out the show. No, it's really interesting. It goes on and on. That's about an hour.

223
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,340
But yeah, you might want to try it out on the weekend or something.

224
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:42,820
Okay. Let me see. Did all that? Did all that? Ah, of course I have to mention today sponsors.

225
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:48,180
Unwind is the new show that Angie B is put together. It truly is a show to unwind by. It's brought

226
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:53,220
to you by Tylenol PM, which soon will have an endorsement from the lady Patricia on this product.

227
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:00,580
I hope if she wakes up from it. And of course by Folger's Coffee, you want to try out the gourmet

228
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:06,900
blends. I had a like a flash of doneness on my way into the city today. I was like, you know,

229
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,740
this is really stupid. I love Senseo. You know, but the Folger's thing is what's happening right now.

230
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,100
So I said, I got to get me one of those kits. So I couldn't, you know, using a Senseo machine,

231
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,660
has nothing to do with their coffee. So I can't wait. I mean, check out this, this like mega

232
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,460
mega combo of God going on here. So we're going to get the Senseo machine. Well, I have the

233
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,340
machine. I'm going to get the kit to make my own pouches, my own pads, pods whenever the

234
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,740
hell they're called. And I'm going to put Folger's gourmet blend in there. And then I'm going to

235
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:43,780
top it off with some splenda. I love it. How we're grouping advertisers. That's really nice.

236
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,340
It's working. You just watch they're going to be they're going to be auditioning before too soon.

237
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,420
Now talking about money or following the money. I was actually I was listening to the

238
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,980
most recent tweet. I think episode 91. I wish I would have been on that show. It was a lot of

239
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,500
really good guests. And they were talking about Google and YouTube. And you know, you know, a show

240
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,820
was really good when when you start yelling back at the show, you know, you're listening to it and

241
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,660
like, what are you talking about? You know, I was like, oh, I can't hear me. You know, this was

242
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,420
recorded on Friday. But you know, that something is really resonating. I really wish I had been

243
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,940
a part of that. Actually, a comment came in regarding the same topic. Let's just get this started

244
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:32,180
with this. Adam, it's Andrew Terry. Listen up from the Midlands in the UK. Just listening to the show

245
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:38,260
that you did on the 19th. Kind of the number when you're talking about the Viacom versus Gucci

246
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,660
lawsuit. And that you're kind of making the point that Viacom have a right to sue

247
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:52,420
YouTube because it's copyrighted material that people are posting. I don't profess to be an expert

248
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:59,220
and I did have a thought that you have several pod-safe music artists, code in and say that

249
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,740
when they hear when when their music is played on the daily source code, they see a jump

250
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:12,580
in in sales that can be directly attributed to being played on the SC now. I'm just wondering

251
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:20,500
if that translates across to YouTube. So some of you posts a clip from a Viacom show. Do they

252
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:27,780
see an increase in viewing figures or does it drive more viewers to go watch the whole program?

253
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:33,860
I don't know, but just like I think the Viacom might be killing the goose that lays the gold

254
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,460
necks a little bit, but there you go. Not the show. It's still a folder. Bye.

255
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,580
All right. Thank you very much. You know, from the Midlands, no less.

256
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,860
Yeah. You know, we've got to distill this down a little bit because there's a couple of pieces

257
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,700
of the puzzle that you have to really understand to really know what's going on. And the number one

258
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:02,820
part is the money. It's all about, it's fuck copyrights. I truly believe that, you know, of course

259
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:09,300
there are lots of really ancient, tried, and tested laws that go along with mainstream media. So

260
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,060
you know, these, of course, do not necessarily apply to the internet. So that's kind of where the

261
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,020
the whole conundrum is of how things work or how things should work or shouldn't work. But when it

262
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:24,900
comes to money, you know, these guys are all about monetizing. So whether it's ABC or CBS or Viacom,

263
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:31,700
the parent company or GE or MTV networks, they're all about monetizing what they do. And, you know,

264
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:38,020
they understand promotion very, very well. But there's a lot of things that happen when you

265
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:45,540
don't control the flow of money. Oh, there it is. Excuse me. So when you don't control the flow of

266
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:52,660
money, it's very, very frightening. How you're going to, you know, how you're going to manage

267
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:59,380
what is going on. And obviously there's, there's part of a copyright conversation where look,

268
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,660
if some, if you want to actually do anything against copyright infringement in the future,

269
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,260
you, you have to pretty much show the history that you've always been right on top of it.

270
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:13,140
You haven't just let this go. So that, that's part one. I mean, the real issue here is that they

271
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,500
couldn't come to terms about the money, because the way Google operates is, you know, they

272
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,540
have seen these deals before. They pay money upfront and they say, okay, we're going to do

273
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:33,140
X amount of ad revenue for you. And, and here, the terms of our deal. Now, the advertising business

274
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:39,620
of YouTube is so uncertain. It is so unpredictable that I think they really are afraid to put a

275
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:46,020
real number out there, which is, which would be meaningful enough, because obviously the way

276
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,180
juice is set up, you know, they cut a deal with Viacom, no problem. You know, of course,

277
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,340
there's control there. There's, you know, access to who sees what and how. And that's all with,

278
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:00,420
it is done with digital rights management. And, you know, YouTube just really doesn't have that.

279
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:05,220
And also, you know, juice is being programmed. It's not going to be a happy go lucky thing,

280
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,660
upload anything you want. It's, it's going to be a controlled environment. You can see there the

281
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,700
Viacom is very happy to jump on board. You know, I'm really sorry if you're listening to this

282
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,180
on serious stars 102, because we're just about to get to the good stuff. So, of course, you've got

283
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:23,460
a whole line up this evening for you. But if you go to dailysourcecode.com, you can download the rest.

284
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:31,540
So, um, so clearly Google couldn't make an offer that Viacom, you know, found acceptable

285
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,860
and just, you may be the realm or other deals that they've done understood. Here's the thing that I

286
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,300
believe is starting to get a little bit dangerous. Um, and it really dawned on me listening to

287
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:50,980
the episode 91 of Twitter. Let's stop telling them how fucking awesome it is online. Okay,

288
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,260
everyone's talking about the promotional value and how, you know, ever since these clips have been

289
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,700
up on YouTube that these shows, the daily show and late night with David Letterman that viewership has

290
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:07,540
gone up, stop telling them that. Stop using that as an argument. If we ever want any of our shows,

291
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:12,900
to get through all the clutter, look at iTunes for Christ's sake. It's not easy, you know, to get

292
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:18,900
into rotation on iTunes. It's very hard, you know, to, to be one of the gems of independently

293
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,260
produced media that, you know, audience are out there trying to pick out from, from anything that's,

294
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,140
you know, that's displayed on the homepage. It's all NPR and mainstream stuff. So, stop telling them

295
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:35,700
how to do it. Please, stop telling them how good it really is. What are you trying to convince them

296
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,140
to do? You know, I, I say, go around them. Please, and, you know, that's exactly what we're doing

297
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,420
with bum rush the charts. And I, I, I, I really, really like this initiative. I have nothing to do with

298
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:53,220
it personally other than I'm on board. I'm on it and I totally want this to work on the 22nd.

299
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:59,700
So, that's tomorrow, the Thursday, March 22nd. We would like as many audience members as we can

300
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,020
put together and I have no idea how many shows are actually participating in this at this point.

301
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:13,140
But I did see an article on, um, where is it? The article was in Billboard magazine,

302
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:20,580
checked this out, written by Anthony Bruno, a grassroots group, a grassroots group of podcasting

303
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:26,020
official nodos. Oh, yes, official nodos. You hear that Chris Penn, financial aid podcast,

304
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:31,380
you're an official nodo? Are hoping to catapult an indie artist to the top of the iTunes

305
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,540
digital track chart this week. In initiative called bum rush the charts with the hyperlink

306
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:40,820
there. Very nice. The group is running promotional videos on YouTube and other sites as well as

307
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:47,060
in various podcasts of participating broadcasters. Interesting choice of words there to encourage

308
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:53,060
music fans to buy the song, mine again by the band Black Lab on March 22nd, home on a second.

309
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:59,620
Did they just say, YouTube? Oh, here it is. Oh, excellent. If you go to bum rush the chart

310
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:05,140
start calm. Oh, this is awesome. It's a YouTube video of Natalie Delcante. Oh, let me see what she says.

311
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:12,020
Oh, she's got one of those low cut dresses, not the like the two top. I want to encourage you to

312
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:20,020
please bum rush the charts. Yes, Natalie. I'll bum rush anything for you. Now, bum rush is about

313
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,380
the power of organic music discovery. We need big record labels to tell us what's good music

314
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,540
talking about the internet connection ourselves. Let's show big music what the little people

315
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,460
can do and take a song to number one on iTunes. On March 22nd, download mine again

316
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,140
a new song from Black Lab and every commission. This is pretty awesome. Made will be donated

317
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:48,260
to college scholarships around the country. You know, this I'm glad that she participated in this.

318
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,860
Let me see if she winks at the end bum rush. Come on. Give me a call to action, Natalie.

319
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:58,580
Set a calendar reminder, tie a string on a string around my finger finger, set your cell phone to

320
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,700
go off whatever. Just don't forget because we're bum rushing the chart.

321
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:10,180
A nice smile. Okay. I should put that in my show notes as well. That's pretty cool.

322
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:15,220
So I think I'm going to post the the link today because you know, a lot of people don't get this

323
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,420
until a day later. So you know, since we're on such a time shift is exactly how we started the show off.

324
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:28,180
I'm going to start plugging it now. So the point is think about what's going to happen. Think

325
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:33,540
about the message we send. Well, all this turmoil is going on and all we're doing, you know,

326
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:40,500
and you remember, you know, my speech, my saliliqui, about doers and and talkers. So a lot of

327
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:46,100
people talking about via com and YouTube and big big media and big record companies. Now we can

328
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:51,780
do something and you don't have to be a podcast or please, it's it's it's really about the audience.

329
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:57,460
You guys listening to this. Let's show them. I mean, you'd listen to some of the pod safe songs.

330
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,980
You know, I'm sure you listen to a couple of podcasts if you're listening to my, you've got to.

331
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,820
And I'm sure I don't think many people only listen to my show. I hope not.

332
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:15,700
So it's really up to you. It would be so nice if we can make this happen. The ink is out there.

333
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,260
If we make it work, the ink is going to come flowing in. We're going to have a lot of people who can

334
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,700
take credit for it, which is really, really nice. This is not a pod show initiative.

335
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,860
Yeah, there's some pod show, aficionados, but it's not a pod show initiative.

336
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,220
This is not like some kind of fucking pyramid scheme. The money is going to scholarships.

337
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,540
Black lab chosen because they were dropped by a major label. We'd like to, you know, for them,

338
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:48,820
yes, it's a big FU, which is very cool. And I know that this is going to be very exciting.

339
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:54,500
Already I've been contacted by two record labels. One of the large labels as, you know,

340
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,460
a small division of one of the four large labels. And by a large independent label,

341
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,340
both already saying this is what I found interesting. Hey, we really like this idea that you've got

342
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:10,580
going on there. You know, can we do a bum rush to charts with the one of our artists? Well,

343
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:16,420
isn't that interesting? So the answer, of course, is no because it doesn't work that way.

344
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,660
But if you jump into the middle, you join the pod safe music network. You start promoting

345
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,580
your shit like everybody else. You know, you start doing interviews. You start working it.

346
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,180
You know, you become involved. It's going to happen by itself. We're only showing the power.

347
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,740
The power is going to be within anyone who wants to harness it and wants to utilize it

348
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,700
and wants to join in with what we're doing. It really, really make the new revolution happen.

349
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,820
Let's see what Mark, Mark sent something new in about this. This is Mark Yoshimoto,

350
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,580
Namcoff, author of the podcast novel Shadow Falls Badlands.

351
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,940
Bum rush the charts on March 22nd is almost upon us. And I've heard some people grumbling about

352
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,660
what iTunes and I hate DRM, so I'm not going to do it. That's funny. That's exactly the way

353
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,860
podcast pickle sounds to me as well. And podcast alley for that matter. Well, I think these folks

354
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:11,380
are missing the point. Digital rights management is another issue entirely that has nothing to do

355
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:17,460
with Bum rush, duh. I mean, it's basically like saying, I won't give blood because I hate needles.

356
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:23,220
As to the question of why iTunes? Well, I'll tell you why. Because for the last two years,

357
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,980
iTunes has been one of the top 10 music retailers in the US, beating out other top tenors

358
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:34,900
like tower records, borders, and Sam Goodie. And when a conservative minded company like Walmart

359
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,580
is the number one music retailer in the country, you can see why corporate media chooses to push

360
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,180
water down bullshit like Nickelback, Clay, Aiken, and Justin Timberlake. Think about it.

361
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:53,300
Entertainment is being dumbed down to pander to the lowest common denominator. And this is exactly

362
00:31:53,300 --> 00:32:00,260
why we need to bummer us the charts on March 22nd to at least begin to show that independent music

363
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,980
and entertainment is a choice that people are making. You know, what's that old saying? Stand

364
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:10,580
up and be counted? Well, bummer us is just that. It's a role call for all of us taking part in

365
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:16,660
creating and consuming new media that understand that the power of any social movement is the ability

366
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:22,500
to make people at least consider that there are alternatives out there other than what society tells

367
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,420
you. And if you're willing, just sit on your couch and settle because it's easier. Well,

368
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,900
then traditional media will provide you with the problem you're looking for. But if you,

369
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:38,100
like me and millions of others who consume new media every day, want to make a statement that says,

370
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:43,220
I'm making my own choices for what entertainment I want. Then you'll go check out bummer us the

371
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:50,260
charts.com and see what we're doing on Thursday, March 22nd. Traditional media's networks are

372
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:56,820
groups held together by corporate and financial agendas. New media's social networks are groups

373
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:02,500
held together by people who enjoy creating relationships and communities and by taking two minutes

374
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:08,580
of your time and 99 cents to bummer us the charts with us on March 22nd. You're saying,

375
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:14,980
you want to be part of a community that values independent media. For more information, go to

376
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:23,620
bummer us the charts.com. All right, Mark. So while Mark was in his, uh,

377
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:29,140
in his little speech there, I was looking at bummer us the charts.com. I was looking for the link for

378
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:34,740
the affiliate link. But I guess the page actually changes on March 22nd. So I'm just going to put

379
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:40,740
the bad job. Because because all we have to do is put the put the I'm in bummer us the charts.com,

380
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,980
logo in our show notes. And then you'll click on that on the 22nd you'll be able to go and buy it.

381
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,020
And I guess it'll stay up from that moment on. So I really don't expect any results until

382
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,260
probably the 23rd, maybe the 24th. I don't know. It could be surprising. And of course, we have

383
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,060
no idea how the charts work on Apple side, uh, someone could totally be gaming it. It could be that

384
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:07,220
someone writes it down. I don't know. And for the same reason, we could have some friends over

385
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:12,580
Apple keep their eye on it and, uh, and give it a nudge. But either way, if we could actually

386
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:18,740
pull this off, think about how exciting that's going to be. That is going to change the rules dramatically.

387
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,940
I promise you, because it's all about the money. How many times have artists called in and said,

388
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,900
dude, you played the song on the show, other podcasts, there's played the song, uh, all of a

389
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,140
sudden, we're we're selling stuff. The right tunes were selling full CDs through CD Baby,

390
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:39,700
attendance at gigs is up. Merch sales goes up. It works. It just works. And this is how we work together.

391
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:45,620
You know, podshow takes no money. I take no money. I'm not interested in shaving pennies off of

392
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,620
an artist's sales. I'm just not interested. That's not my business. I want to help you because

393
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:54,820
you're giving me content in in four to five minutes chunks every single time. I love you for it.

394
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:04,420
Okay, a black lab. Mine again is the song you want to buy. And there's so much of good black

395
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,620
lab stuff on the PMN. I picked this one up again. See the sun.

396
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:55,860
I can't feel you. I can't feel you. I can't feel you. I can't feel you. I can't feel you.

397
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:05,060
I can't be on your mind. You're my side. I feel fine.

398
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:24,420
Are you my lovely show? Are you the answer to my question? Have I wasted my time now?

399
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:31,020
Cause if I feel this feeling, but you crawl out of your foot

400
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,460
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm crying the night when you shine

401
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,020
Will you be in my life?

402
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:46,700
Cause I can't see the sun, I can't feel it

403
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:54,540
Crying more, I can't see the sun, I can't see the sun

404
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:59,900
Will I don't run in your blood my side?

405
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,900
I feel fine

406
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,220
I feel fine

407
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
I feel fine

408
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:27,060
I feel fine, I can't see the sun, I can't see the sun

409
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:32,060
Will I don't run in your blood my side?

410
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,900
I feel fine

411
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,660
Crying more, I can't see the sun, I can't see the sun

412
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,700
Will I don't run in your blood my side?

413
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:46,700
I can't see the sun, I can't see the sun

414
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Will I don't run in your blood my side?

415
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,700
I can't see the sun, I can't see the sun

416
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,700
Will I don't run in your blood my side?

417
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:13,700
I can't see the sun, I can't feel it Crying more

418
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,700
I can't see the sun, I can't see the sun

419
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Will I don't run in your blood my side?

420
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
I feel fine

421
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:49,700
Crying more, I can't see the sun, I can't see the sun

422
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:55,700
I feel fine, I can't see the sun

423
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:02,700
I'm looking for that darn link

424
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,700
The Stanford thing

425
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,700
I got it through Google Reader

426
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,700
And it had a whole set of different links from Andrew's blog

427
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,700
Okay, so at least another half hour of getting all that crap done

428
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,700
And then off to Betty by

429
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
Tomorrow I'll be back remember

430
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,700
Get ready to bum rest the charts, click on the link, go to the page
