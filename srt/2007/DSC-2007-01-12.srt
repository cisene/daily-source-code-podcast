00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
Well, hello everybody. Welcome to Camp Curry, third floor in my inner sanctum. This is the

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,760
daily source code episode number 525. How you doing everybody? It's been two days since

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,360
I've posted a show and I apologize profusely, of course, I'm behind on my best of

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,960
Charlie's but, no worries, because I'm just going to carry on throughout the weekend.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,880
I have not been able to build the studio, as you can hear, I'm not on my regular setup right

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:39,360
now, I'm just on the Sony Vio using my sound blaster PCM PCM CIA card, Jack the wireless

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,640
microphone into it, so I'm going straight in old school, you know, the mobile setup, essentially.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,520
San seo, excuse me. Oh, by the way, since seo with a little bit of splendor, I heard the guys

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,360
just renewed their contracts another three months of splendor on the network, happy to have them

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,720
aboard for another 90 days. The girls are gone, Christina's at school, Patricia is at the other house

11
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,200
working with the cleanup crew at the cottage, of course, and I would have to say we're just about

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,720
moved in. That doesn't mean that anything's unpacked and there are some problems we've run into.

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,200
The biggest problem being that the podcast console, essentially the piece of furniture my father

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,160
and law, my 81-year-old father-in-law made for me, doesn't fit. It does not fit up the staircase

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:41,520
to the third floor in her sanctum, and it really can't take it apart. It would be a real shame to

16
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,960
saw it up. I'm just completely in limbo over what I'm going to do with that. I really didn't have

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,000
one second of time to even build up a temporary setup. We were just really, really, but if you've

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,720
moved, you know what it's like. Now, of course, we just have tons and tons of shit. And Monday,

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,560
believe they're not, there's more stuff coming from, there's a truck coming from storage,

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,480
and there will be a truck going back with stuff from storage, but Patricia's doing some kind of swap

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,560
out. Anyway, really like in the new place. Still sounds a little bit hollow. I'll tell you what,

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm going to stick the microphone out the window for a second so you can just listen to the nature

23
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:31,280
here on the west side of Gilford. Actually, here's some, oops, hold on. Don't want to lose my

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:40,960
microphone clip. Well, you can actually hear the road when you amplify with the mic.

25
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,520
Trying to get you a good sound scene tour here. I forgot about it.

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,040
Anyway, oh, before I forget, I promised I'd play a promo, and I'll tell you why right after it rolls.

27
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,400
I'm Andrew. I'm Andrew. We do a podcast call just one more book.

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,560
A podcast about the children's books we love, and why we love them. Because we're crazy about

29
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,080
kids' books. Three times a week, we go to a coffee shop in our neighborhood, and we bring

30
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
a children's book that we love from our own collection. The amazing style, the way she puts her

31
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,080
words together. We talk about why we love the book and how our daughters experience that book.

32
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,240
And they just show themselves nothing, and they're just in total suspense, and it's a complete

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,480
page turner. We interview authors and illustrators. Hey, this is E.B. McKenley.

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,680
Lee Edward Foley. Shane Evans. Sheriffette. E. Wipe out. Played listener, submitted reviews.

35
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,720
My favorite book. Talk about how and where to find great books. One of the big secrets to our

36
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,360
gorgeous book collection. The great book Shamina of Hurt of the ones that aren't prominently displayed

37
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,680
at big box stores are on Amazon.com. They were just so in love with this book. Oh, yeah.

38
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,240
We're just hanging off every word. And all the characters. Oh, yeah. You can find our podcast at

39
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:06,000
just one more book.com. Julian Smith asked me to play that promo. And I'm happy to oblige.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,480
He tried to get it into the show the best of Charlie today, which I guess you forgot.

41
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,360
And today's best of Charlie is from Julian Smith from inovierhead.net. He worked

42
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,280
kind of payment in the last minute, but worked really hard on putting this together. And I'm

43
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,200
completely chuffed about this particular best of Charlie because he really went back in the

44
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,200
archives. And if you want to hear when we discover Don and Drew together, when we discovered

45
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,320
Michael Butler together and much, much more. Even before it was called the Daily Source Code,

46
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,120
I believe. And I haven't listened to the whole thing. I listened to the first half and I said,

47
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,840
oh shit, I got to stop. I want to listen to this fresh. And I want to be surprised. I don't want

48
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,800
to get anything away while I'm introwing it. I'm really, really pleased. And I think you will be

49
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,160
as well. It's a bit of podcast history. Today, of course, is the 12th of January. Let me just double

50
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,000
check. Yes, 12th of January. The day that stomped the yard, the brand new movie opens up. If you

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,680
want to know all about that movie, go to stompedthepodcast.com. Tony Costa will be more than

52
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,160
happy to tell you all about it. He's got a couple of episodes. I think he even has some interviews

53
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,600
with some of the stars, or at least they're coming up, perhaps. So this will be the

54
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,760
Fubar Friday edition. And it's quite fitting because everything my friends is Fubar.

55
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,880
I'm going to take a couple of snaps of all the boxes and what it looks like up here. And maybe a

56
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,240
couple of shots around the house were really, really happy. Thanks for all the nice emails and words

57
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,080
of encouragement that you send. I mean, it's not like the end of the world, but yeah, it has been

58
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:53,440
quite a bit of work, I'll say. When we moved to the cottage two years ago, it was like a pick-up

59
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,960
and move. We just want to get out of the, get off the continent, come over to the island. And we

60
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,000
stuffed a lot of stuff in a lot of places. And now it was really the time to go back and say,

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,400
all right, what is this stuff? Or is it shit? And can we get rid of it? And actually we have,

62
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,480
I'm still still getting my stuff together for the big eBay sale. That's gonna be fun.

63
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,720
All right, I'm going to shut up now. I want you to enjoy this best of Charlie. I think you're really

64
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,840
really going to like it. Once again, thanks to Julian Smith in over your head.net. And I'll talk to you

65
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,800
guys over the weekend. Enjoy. I have recorded this intro so many times that it is, I am becoming

66
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,440
almost obsessive-compulsive with this best of Charlie that we're producing here. Hello,

67
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,400
good evening. Good morning. Good night. This is Julian from In Over Your Head. I produce a podcast.

68
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,160
Well, I just told you what the podcast was. So I'm not going to say it again. But today,

69
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,800
I've got a little bit of a treat for you. Old podcast, man. Old podcast. I went digging in the

70
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,960
crates and man that I ever go digging. I was up to four on the morning yesterday. I listened to

71
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,600
about 20 daily source codes in the past three days. And so I think I've got some really cool gems for you.

72
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,680
Mostly podcasts from 2004. Times when I started listening to podcasts, when things were different,

73
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:22,160
everybody knew who each other were. There were dozens, maybe hundreds of podcasts and not tens of

74
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,960
thousands like there are now. There was a very different world from what it is that we're experiencing

75
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,160
these days with podcasting in 2007. So I'm just going to let my clips talk for me, man. I've got

76
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,760
some really cool stuff. You know, all sorts of stuff. They speak for themselves. And I hope that

77
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,840
you enjoy what it is that I found. Because for me, this is a golden age of podcasting. This got me

78
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,920
started. So check it out. Daily source code best of Charlie number eight. One of you are listening.

79
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,760
If you want to check it out, my website in over your head.net. And I'm sure you'll find some good stuff

80
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,600
there. So that's pretty much it. Let's start off with a track. And then afterwards, we're just going to

81
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,280
go on with the clips. Tell the end. All right. I'll see you there. So I want you to hear the song

82
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,560
and tell me what you think about it. Because I like it. But I was just blown away by, and this is maybe

83
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,520
just 2% of all the stuff that people were sending about this particular song. Deathcab for QD.

84
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,760
Title and Registration, please.

85
00:08:45,520 --> 00:09:00,160
There's nothing to keep my fingers down and all my fun. I've seen the mirrors from better times

86
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:13,120
before the clip of your tail lights fading. To find yourself a better life.

87
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:37,120
I was searching for some legal document. It's the main beat down on the hood.

88
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:55,760
When I stumbled upon the issues I tried to forget. And that's how this idea is drilled into my head.

89
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:17,120
Because it's 2M more time to stay the way it's been. There's no way how our love did slowly fade

90
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:27,360
and now it's gone. It's like it wasn't there at all. And here I was just like the disappointment

91
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:13,120
and I'm regretting that I was just like it wasn't there at all. And here I was just like the disappointment and I'm regretting that I was crying.

92
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm regretting that I was just like it was a shame.

93
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:25,040
When I'm lying, I'm regretting that I was just like it was a shame.

94
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:33,920
Wait, think. That's not your style. I know.

95
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,640
Well, we got to comment from Holland Hunt. Oh. Yeah, it's cool.

96
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,280
Dear Adam and Patricia. This is Ray from Holland. Adam, you know, I'm a big fan of yours.

97
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:53,200
Although I'm not in the situation to listen every day. I really love to hear you on the Charlie and especially

98
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,000
the shows with Patricia. You're to really make it you're the complete. Anyway, last Wednesday,

99
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,480
you were talking about all the burping and the senseo. Actually, you blamed it on the senseo,

100
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,800
but come on, Adam, you know better than that. Really dear Charlie, friends, way back in the 80s,

101
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,640
even before the workoffing machines, Adam hosted a radio show in Holland on Friday night with.

102
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,280
Do you remember this? I remember this. I remember the moment. Okay, I'll let you tell the moment

103
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,200
after he plays the segment. Well, I think three million listeners. He was already doing these

104
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,840
things on air. It's not new. He's just a boy with a big mouth burping on air. When it

105
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:43,760
was a dream, you had an Amsterdam. You're doing it. You're doing it, you're doing it, you're doing it.

106
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,760
I was even better with the senseo. I was the one who came out of the house and didn't find it.

107
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,560
That was the four, four, four. Yeah, M. C. It was the M. C. It's the midday. Yeah, I don't know.

108
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:05,440
That was bad in these days. So this was 1984, I think, or 85. And on Friday, there was only one

109
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,400
popular radio station that was legal. We both come this, do they do that on the BBC right now?

110
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,680
Burping? Yeah, can they? Yeah. Can Terry Burp? I don't think that doesn't fit with Terry. But

111
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,000
Chris Moiles, I'm sure, I'm sure would do that. But in 84, I mean, there's just no way. No way.

112
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,680
And so this was my co-host who was reading a story and then he couldn't find the words and all

113
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,280
and I just, I remember, I had this big gulp of coke and I went, and then I immediately blamed him.

114
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it sounded like he did it. Yeah, and I remember, I was in the car.

115
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,080
Because we were having a secret affair at the time, right? I know, I was driving to you to your house already.

116
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,200
Like 180 in your poor. In my purse, I had to park the car. I was in shock.

117
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,920
I was in shock. I had to park the car and I was thinking, did I hear that well?

118
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:58,640
God, he was burping. I couldn't believe it because that was, that was no, not done. Not done at all.

119
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,200
No. No, I've never, and it was my, the first time I heard it from him. I'm such a visionary, aren't I?

120
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,800
You are the first with everything.

121
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,880
In my boss at the time, Lex Harding was on a boat. Right, but he was on a boat when he heard it. And he

122
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,760
almost fell overboard. But it was called you, right? Yeah, yeah, right in your heart, you sure? Yeah.

123
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,720
Yeah, he said, dude. The red telephone dude. Not only can you not do that, but you almost got me really

124
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,960
wet. But that was it. It was no problem. This one, you might want to sit down for.

125
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,600
So I listened to some really good shows. And obviously, I was able to start the sniffing

126
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,760
to tears song. And I probably can do the, uh, I probably can do the theme song at the end of the show with a

127
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,240
little too much to be cruising through segments and pulling out bits today. But I do have my,

128
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,480
my iPod handy. And what I'll do is I just want to talk about a few of these podcast

129
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,080
because it's just, oh, lovely. And then when I get home, I'll, I'll edit it in just a couple of

130
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:01,040
bits so you can, so you can hear what's up. So it's almost live. It's, uh, well, it's live on tape, right?

131
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,360
So, uh, first there's the Don and Drew Show, a husband and wife teen, which just cracked me up.

132
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,960
Um, and it's good to hear a woman's voice on, uh, on a podcast. And so far it's been, uh, men, men,

133
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,760
men, men, men. Um, and so they're just kind of shoot the breeze, uh, but they're funny together.

134
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,360
You know, when, when you have a husband and wife teen, that, um, have known each other for a while,

135
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,840
when they talk, they kind of fill in the blanks and they can also rank on each other a bit from the

136
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,360
Don and Drew Show. Welcome to the Don and Drew Show. I'm Don Micelli. And I'm Drew Donkis.

137
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,280
And this is, I show. That's right. So listen up, bitches. Enjoy.

138
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,160
For this evening, the role of Drew Donkis will be played by James.

139
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,120
Welcome to the Don and Drew Show. I am Drew Donkis. And broadcasting live from the

140
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,880
satellite of love. That's right. I'm Don Micelli. For this evening, the role of Don Micelli

141
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,040
will be played by Chris Moore. The Don and Drew Show, and if you want to subscribe to that podcast,

142
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,640
really easy, just go to iPod.org. Go into the download and shows directory. And, uh, you can find it

143
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,880
right there. And the way I'm doing it now, though, I'm going to start to split up into different categories.

144
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,360
Is every single time, as a new, uh, new show added to the directory. It'll be listed on top.

145
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,920
So it's kind of reverse chronological order. Oops. I just, I'm going to leave this. I just

146
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,720
remember that I have to make a pit stop in between here and home. So basically, I'm driving from

147
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:36,240
Amsterdam via Rotterdam to Belgium. It's one straight line. But I have to stop off about three

148
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,520
quarters of the way in Brida. That's where, if you ever in Brida, be our EDA in the Netherlands,

149
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:50,640
Brida, lovely town. There's a coffee shop there called Purple Rain. That's where my, my Moroccan

150
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:58,800
buddies are. And, uh, well, it's time for another refill. Moving on with some cool podcasts.

151
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,000
Um, I found, uh, oh, I didn't just find it. Of course, you know, every single one I

152
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,640
add to the directory. I pretty much subscribed to it, at least to get the show in and listen to it.

153
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:19,040
The rock and roll, uh, geek show. Now, this is hosted by, uh, Michael Butler. And Michael Butler is

154
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,080
the base player for a band, uh, which I don't, I think I might have heard them before. American

155
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,160
heartbreak. They've been around for about seven years. And when I liked about this podcast,

156
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,800
is what Michael's doing, uh, and by the way, what is it with base players who are named Butler?

157
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:40,080
You know, every year of geyser Butler? Black Sabbath. So, um, Michael is doing it a little bit

158
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,040
differently. Instead of recording a complete show, he records little bits and they'll just pick it

159
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:50,320
up. So it's kind of like a diary. And, um, well, uh, here's, here's a bit of him, uh, in the morning,

160
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,720
after, um, after, uh, he went to a show the night before for the New York Dolls. And here's how

161
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:06,640
he was feeling. It's Tuesday morning, the day after the New York Dolls show. I am so tired.

162
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,600
I'm on my way to work and I do not want to be here. Now, of course, always not lost. Uh,

163
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,040
he might have felt really crappy. But he also got a great ID for the show. And when we talk

164
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,840
about IDs in the radio business, that basically means, hi, I'm fill on the blank celebrity name.

165
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,160
You're listening to fill on the blank radio program name. And our buddy Michael got one from David

166
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:39,040
Gioyance, and the New York Dolls. This is David Gioyance, and then you're listening to unfortunately

167
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:46,480
the record roll geek show. The only thing that was, that was missing from that is he should have

168
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,280
said you're listening to the, uh, the rock and roll geek podcast, but all right, close enough. So

169
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,160
anyway, so Michael really does this whole thing. And I don't know what it is with him and his wife,

170
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,320
but he keeps threatening that, you know, his wife, uh, who he says doesn't understand what he's

171
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,400
doing and why doesn't agree what he's doing. He's taping it all in his bedroom. Whenever she comes in,

172
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,880
they start nagging each other and he keeps threatening to record all session. So we still have

173
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:20,240
that to look forward to. But really nice was a bit that he added onto the show, which was a recording

174
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,840
of him and a couple of the band members on KSFU, which is a college radio station, promoting a show

175
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,400
that they were doing. And also played a couple of songs from their album, which I think they're

176
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,640
at, they may be on some independent labels, uh, in Europe, they've toured Europe, um, here's the

177
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,320
traffic jam I'm already seeing that we're slowing down to a crawl. That's good. I'll get me some, uh,

178
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,080
maybe some time to queue up some stuff even if we really come to a standstill. What was nice about

179
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,360
hearing the college radio show interview was that all of a sudden that hit me, you know,

180
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,040
do you remember, and many of you will, back in the 80s, certainly at MTV, and at MTV,

181
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,560
primarily college radio was always cool, you know, the buzz. It's, you know, college radio is playing

182
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,800
this. This is up and coming. And college radio is cool to listen to because it's, you know, it's

183
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,480
on, uh, it's basically almost unsensored. It's, you know, it's non-commercial. It's just kids haven't

184
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,360
fun and people, uh, saying the truth and playing the hard out. And, uh, hey, it's someone,

185
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,920
someone's holding up his iPod. Hold on, roll down your window.

186
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,920
Eggs, you didn't think you opened the name, uh, here, come here. Who hate you?

187
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:39,280
It ain't on boards, but ain't on boards, okay dude. Yeah, what? Dude, we checked out a guy just drove

188
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,800
up next to me, and he's honking his horn and he's holding his iPod off. And he's saying,

189
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,600
I'm listening to the podcast. God damn, and I said, uh, I'm recording one right now. So,

190
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,080
Raymond, buddy. Oh, that's very cool. See, this is what I mean. This is what it's all about.

191
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,480
Oh, that gives me a boost of energy. That's fucking great.

192
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,800
Started singing before her lips arrived in the position to match the words of the song.

193
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,040
So she's lung off stage and said her bed played it wrong.

194
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,920
57% of Americans have sex outdoors. 51% and sex on the first date.

195
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,280
48% they don't get them, but they're not horse. 12% and sex and work. They couldn't wait.

196
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,440
Halloween has been canceled out of Washington State School, because it takes time from their

197
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,560
studies and the scientists just so cool dirt the feelings of real life, which is it makes them sad

198
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,080
to sing up some lead and pointy hats and noses cackling at high pitches, state tune for late

199
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:17,920
Viking Pop Dates. That's the tap dance and podcast. I guess maybe one of the things that you

200
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,880
need to know about all these cliffs is that they maybe out of context, it may not be as significant

201
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:30,080
as to somebody who who maybe has been following progression of podcasting for a very long time.

202
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,320
All these are clips from early daily source codes dating back from 2004. The clip that you just

203
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,560
heard before that was the first time that Adam ever mentioned the Dawn and Drew show on his podcast.

204
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,160
And obviously the first time he had also mentioned Michael Butler. Like I was saying at the time,

205
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:52,480
you know what I mean? It was just you could go ahead and you could just find whatever podcast you

206
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,640
wanted on on director. He said, you know what I mean? They weren't so overwhelming as they are now.

207
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:07,920
And before that clips from Adam burping on on Dutch radio in 1984. And the tap dancing is

208
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:15,280
another clip. I mean just one after the other. These are just amazing bits that I probably amongst

209
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,760
other people thought was lost. And so I guess one of the last things that I want to play right now

210
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:27,200
because there's so little time is the clip that really got me into podcasting. And that is,

211
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,400
I remember I was sitting in a cafe on a rainy day. I think it was even a Friday night and I

212
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,560
felt like kind of a loser for not hanging out with my friends or whatever. And what ended up happening

213
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:43,600
was I listened to this daily source code where Patricia talks about her affair with, well I

214
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,400
wouldn't call it an affair, her encounter with David Bowie. And I remember sitting there,

215
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,560
I was sitting at a loan at a table and just listening to this clip blew my mind.

216
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,120
And I was like this, I have to do this. I have to get involved in this podcasting thing. This thing

217
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:07,200
is going to be huge, it's going to be incredible. And I started my podcast like probably days after that.

218
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,080
And so that's it. So I mean I found this clip. It was one of the first clips that I found.

219
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,760
And I'm going to play as much as I can over the next couple of minutes. So you guys get an idea

220
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,200
of, uh, I guess really what podcasting was like in its heyday. There is so much more that I

221
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,840
wish I could share with you guys. And I'm trying not to go over the 24 minutes. We'll see how it goes.

222
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,680
All right. If I don't, I'll see you guys maybe soon. See you later. Peace.

223
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,880
I didn't think he was sexy at all. He didn't look sexy at all. He was very strange. He was he was

224
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:49,920
his guitar was hanging around his neck the whole day. And he was playing it. And so everybody said,

225
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,280
oh can you please tell the guy to stop? What was he playing? What was he playing? Oh,

226
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,400
sort of things. And he was always saying, um, so we went to the, I remember when we went to

227
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,680
for a walk on the beach. And he was singing songs from me because he was making,

228
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,240
one is a good, a good, a good, a good, a good, a good, a good, a good, a good, a good. He was trying to make

229
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:16,080
an impression. And we was quite boring. And what song was he playing? He was playing, um, I remember

230
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,480
he said, do you like this song? Listen, I'm going to play. And I thought I heard it already, but

231
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:29,600
okay. And he played ground control to major time. And I, and I thought, oh man, and it never ended.

232
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,760
And he was based on it. Yeah, and he said, and he said, and he said, and we don't

233
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,800
you think I sound like John Lennon? Oh, really? Yeah, he thought he sounded like John Lennon.

234
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,800
That's what he was his big idol. Yeah, he was a sound like it. But that was based on it. And

235
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,840
but for him, he wasn't a star yet, but he was actually, I think they sent it because I thought

236
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,040
there is something going on, but we don't know what to do for color eyes. So, and he said, I just got

237
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,400
a record deal. And that's probably going to record this song. And I thought, man, I hated already.

238
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,720
It sounded horrible. And you had to see him because he was, he was not wearing swimming

239
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:17,360
trunks or anything. He was wearing diapers. He had sort of, you know, he wanted to be different.

240
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,400
And that's, you know, he still was wearing diaper. He was so different from the rest. He was wearing

241
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,840
a sort of, you know, what you see when Jesus in, you know, he's seen the Bible there.

242
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,680
Like a joint cloth? Yeah, a joint cloth. Yeah. Really? So, it looked like a diaper.

243
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,720
Like a Roman thing or just nothing on. He was very skinny, very pale.

244
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,600
To like it, it turned his eyes off. He needed to slide it up, you know. He was so white.

245
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,920
And he was singing, and proud, and proud, and controlled the whole day. And I thought, man,

246
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:56,560
just shut the fuck up. So, and he tried, and of course, he tried to kiss me, you know,

247
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,640
these things. Wait, what was it? Did he have the orange hair? Was that the Ziggy hair?

248
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,240
No, no, just blonde hair, nothing, nothing. He said, no, he was not attractive at all.

249
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,600
Okay, and he had the two different color eyes, one brown and one blue. Yeah, green and one blue.

250
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,280
No, he always had. And it's teeth were like horrible. Horrible. Horrible. One, two, three.

251
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,960
You were even, you were even considering kissing that mouth? Well, I kissed a little, but I thought,

252
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,240
geez, no. And you could feel like the jagged edges against your tongue. Yeah, I guess so. I guess so.

253
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,120
And then I remember his girlfriend. He said, yeah, my American girlfriend is coming over,

254
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:40,720
and like, she's very nice, and we could have... We could get together. And maybe have a trio,

255
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:46,000
or maybe she's so much. Yeah, and I thought, geez, and I saw her coming, I thought, oh, no, no,

256
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,360
not Barbara Streisand. So they were trying and trying with nothing happens. So, but years later,

257
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,760
when I was really, really famous, well, you skipped, well, that was that. It was the song festival,

258
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,000
and he didn't win, I didn't win, I don't know, it's enough for that. No, no, he was not,

259
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:11,680
you kissed it. He tried. And he was actually trying at the whole time that I was there.

260
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,040
Yeah, he was more. I was way too pretty for him. And he was the star, and he had a shitty song.

261
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,400
No, no, he was the star. So what happened was after that, it was really a hit.

262
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,320
Yeah, he was like, you came in, he's not the star, he was like, geez, I thought, that's a song.

263
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:35,040
That's a fucking song that I heard. So a couple of years later, after he had a couple of hits,

264
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,640
there was the... Is that a question you had when he had his first hit, you think?

265
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,640
Yeah, I should have done him. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

266
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:51,200
but then then he had, after one, he had that red hair, and he started, he came out and everything,

267
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:58,160
and I had to do a big event that is, that was every year, that's called Kangala Dudes.

268
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,680
Kangala Dudes? Yeah, it's a great gala, no, it's an Amsterdam, and it was very famous,

269
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:12,160
Barry White was there, Dobby Gray, the three degrees. So this was like 74, 75, maybe?

270
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:19,280
Yeah, I see, so no, 74, 74, and the gangala Dudes, and they asked me and my sister because

271
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,560
we were also doing a lot of backing vocals because we were in the best backing vocals you can get,

272
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,520
to back up, to back up some some ex from America. You guys were cute. And we were very cute,

273
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:38,240
and so we did, there was a big orchestra there, and Barry White, we had to do the backing vocals

274
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,320
for Barry White, his backing vocals, but they couldn't sing that well, so we were behind the

275
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:53,040
curtains, doing them, and we backed up, he had to be backing up them, and we did some backing

276
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,840
vocals for the three degrees, just to make it a little bit fuller, because when they, you know,

277
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,440
on the record, it sounds better. But that was like a reo honor, because that was cool, because

278
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,840
you were, we thought it was a good gig, yeah, and it was fun, it was very musical, and you know,

279
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,840
you were your own star. Yeah, sure. And then I was standing, we had to do a couple of things in front

280
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:19,920
of the, the solo stage of the, the audience could see us, and I knew I heard that David Bowie

281
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:27,040
came in, because he was one of the guests too. He was performing on the show. Now he was performing

282
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:33,280
somewhere now, Amsterdam, but he was a guest in the audience, and with his wife. You sure you don't want

283
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,120
to drink a water? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You want to take a sip of coffee? Yeah, it's okay.

284
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,520
It's good. You've never told us. Oh, you're dribbling. You're so excited about David.

285
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:50,320
No, yeah, I am. No, so I was working, and he probably saw me standing there and said to Angie,

286
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:57,200
isn't that, Patricia, we met a couple of years ago. She thinks he's lesbian, but she's just stuck

287
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,920
out for me. Let's, let's go snobber. So afterwards, there was drink, of course, with all the,

288
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:11,520
all the stars. And this was still a seven. And I was walking around there, and, and I bumped into him,

289
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:18,160
and he said, I thought he was you. How are you? Oh, it's so good to see you, and you look so pretty,

290
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,360
and even pretty, and he didn't have, what did he fix? It's very hot, very hot. Because he was, you know,

291
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,840
he was Ziggy Stardis with his suit. So he had the orange hair, right here. And he had this little thing

292
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,560
over his head. He had that out of the party. Yes. No way. Because you know why, because he told me

293
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,960
later, because he had a, and he's no one of his, you know, one of his eyes had a, uh, cataract,

294
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,720
yeah, something, something, because one of the, you know, they're the different color. The different

295
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,560
color, there was something going on. Cool. So that wasn't just a thing. And he had a sort of an infection.

296
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,160
So it was not even, but it looked so, of course, cool. And his teeth were also still fucked up, right?

297
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,440
Yeah, teeth were still crooked. Not anymore. I've seen. Yeah. But it's in white. Yeah.

298
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,600
Yeah. Yeah. That's why it's. I think she demanded to do. Yeah. He said, dude, I'm not going to run

299
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:13,760
on a high degree. I think this is the time to fix your teeth. So, um, uh, someone, we, we met each other

300
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,600
and he said, you would, you'd like to come to the hotel and have a drink with me. So we, it down

301
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,120
says we had a drink in the lobby. And Angie was there too. But in the meanwhile, I heard, and I've

302
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,360
seen a little bit of it, uh, he had quite a fight with the Angie downstairs. She was very drunk.

303
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:36,560
As she said, I'm so pissed. I'm so pissed. And, uh, she was right. Yeah. Yeah, I'm pissed. I'm pissed.

304
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:44,000
Now pissed drunk. And she behaved horribly, because she's, she's a rough lady. And he was very

305
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,080
ashamed of her. And that's why he wants to go back to the hotel and he said, would you like to

306
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,040
come with me in the limo? And, uh, I said, well, I actually have to go home, but, you know,

307
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,520
I haven't seen you for a long time. So, that might be nice. So, I went for a drink.

308
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:03,120
Oh, and you didn't think of that moment? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I didn't know. I mean, I

309
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,200
had to slay thee with him. So, um, I'm a decent girl. Of course not. So, we went upstairs and I had

310
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,920
a lovely, uh, talk about it during your, in his room, you know. Yeah, it was, it was in a big,

311
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,440
the biggest sweets in the am store hotel. And we had a drink and we were talking about the

312
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,440
early days, because what happened in the meanwhile, and I was telling you, did you tell him that

313
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,240
fucking son can't believe it? Oh, yeah, I told him that he had to kind of believe it. Really,

314
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:39,440
you were right. It was it. And, um, and did he say, yeah, told you so? And he was really sweet.

315
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,280
And he was smoking really his head off. You know, cigarettes?

316
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,000
A joints, of course. He was an Amsterdam's, uh, problem. And you're ready to just get

317
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,040
high just for being in the room. A little bit with him. Oh, no, no, no, I smoked. And he, of course,

318
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,720
he loved that. So, it was just, it was very romantic. And he started to, you know,

319
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,520
just touch my hair, my, my, my shoulders, my, you know, my whole body. And I thought, boy,

320
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:15,120
okay, his fame is now. And that was nice. I know he's much nicer. I mean, I thought he is David Bowie,

321
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:20,640
of course, you know. And I said, if I tell my sister, I walked away and I didn't do it.

322
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:27,680
She'll never say, are you crazy? So I went along and we, and he's a great lover. I have to say,

323
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,240
Anna. Really? Yeah, don't want to hear that. But he's a great lover. He has a lot of,

324
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:41,200
so full of the girls that are done and done, done, done this. Are you listening? He is a great

325
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:48,800
lover. He's unbelievable patient. And he wants to give you everything you want. He led you from

326
00:34:48,800 --> 00:35:01,200
me to you to your head. He's not afraid, not at all. His penis size is medium. Not, not, not

327
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,800
that. Thank you for answering that question. So my speaker, Dave Bowie. Oh, absolutely. Boy,

328
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,400
I think he's calling. That's right. Hi, David. I'm sorry. We're going to finish the penis size

329
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,320
conversation. I have to say nothing special. Nothing else matters. Nothing special.

330
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:26,400
Very nice, nicely shaped, but nothing. Is he circumcised? No. No. I remember that. Yeah.

331
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:40,160
No, no, no. Just a normal English dick. And it was nice. He went, oh, and he went on and went for a second time.

332
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,760
There he is calling again. He was going to say it was actually three times.

333
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:53,600
Yeah, yeah, I remember that. And after that, I brushed my teeth with his toothbrush because

334
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:59,600
I always liked brushing my teeth afterwards. And then, you know, when I know that you hate to hear

335
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,640
this, I know that. No, because knowing that my penis is bigger makes a world of difference. Oh, okay,

336
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,720
no, no, no, no. Another pod show podcast. Stick it in your ear.
