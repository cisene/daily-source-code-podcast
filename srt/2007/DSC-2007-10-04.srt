Roll out the red carpet and strike up the band.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's time for Adam Curry and the DSC 669.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Six hundred million dollars worth of airplane striatci my ass.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,800
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,000
I like to think I'm trying to be short.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm casting this out of curry.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go on, I'm taking out the trash.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And once you get them out, tell them not to come back again.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Go!

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That cat in the gym.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To what he said.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
To everything you did.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You had a figure out a wild ago.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And I know it's not exactly breakin' news.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But it's all in a little like a trial for you.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And a bunch of time and won't make it true.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll come on, go!

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why not take out the trash.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And once you get them out, tell them not to come back again.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No, why not give them this land.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Get them to get straight.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Get them to go get them to go home.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So play that.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He's just making it up.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And he's still a little got you coming back for all more.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why never ever thinkin' breakin' it up.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Tell me what the bad dude is gonna close that up.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll come on, go!

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why not take out the trash.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And once you get them out, tell them not to come back again.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, why not give them this land.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Get them to get straight.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Get them to go get them to go home.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm not sitting on the floor.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, why not take out the trash.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And once you get them out, tell them not to come back again.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No, why not take out the trash.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes, there's like every work is still.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why not take out the trash?

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's Friday.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You know it's trash.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Full bar is full of fact on the drier.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why not take my big Giants.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
God, that's a great song.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I do like it.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Daily Short Code 6-6-9 coming to you from the Curry Manor on the west side of

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Utah and Gilford in the Apple and South of Missouri.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I am so tired.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Are you feeling alright?

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Are you just about ready to wrap up your week?

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Cause I sure am.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
My goodness.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's going to be kind of a maximum mashup Friday today.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Some great stuff came out over at mashuptown.com.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I just couldn't choose one.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So I chose two or three.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, my goodness.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let me tell you.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I feel like a working stiff.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I've been working every single day.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I mean, not that I don't work every day, but like going to London.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And man, we had the big digital musical awards on Tuesday.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Of course, we last spoke on crap.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Or was it Monday?

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Another great two-show week.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes, we're doing fantastic.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Sorry.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hitting the microphone out of frustration.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't know if you had a chance to check out the plus, plus TV, which we launched in conjunction

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
with our backstage past coverage of the digital musical awards.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Quite a few people actually did check it out.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm just looking at the numbers here.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And the reason I'm looking at is because, of course,

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
is a press release being prepared about this.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is great mainstream love this shit.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We had over a million uniques to the homepage for the plus TV and or dma.podshow.com.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And over 700,000 unique streams served during the actual coverage itself,

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
average viewing time, peak to about 23 minutes.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now, you have to understand that this, to me, is it just blows me away.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, I knew that, you know, people would watch this stream.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Of course, what we really were doing was creating just lots of segments,

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
stuff that you can get from dma.podshow.com.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You can look at it after the fact that it's downloadable.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's not streaming.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Maybe it's embedded on my question.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I got to check that.

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We knew that, you know, we'd have Dr. Cockney there.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No Jay and Joe Lawrence and Natalie Delcante.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And everyone was creating segments for their regular shows.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But I had no idea so many people would look at the stream.

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And so I'd say we're getting somewhere with this.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We've kind of backed into something beautiful,

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the kind of happened.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, not entirely, not that it wasn't by design,

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
but I just didn't expect it to pop this.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
There's early this heavily, in fact,

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
when we changed all the redirects to send everyone back to the plus TV.com.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The page basically crashed.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So much traffic coming to it.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And I believe actually tonight,

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
at what it's somewhere after midnight,

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
the digital music awards airs on channel 4 here in the UK.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
From what I understand from last year,

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
we will, if not rival,

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
we may even exceed viewership numbers with what we saw online.

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then what people will watch tonight on channel 4 on publicly available broadcast television.

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This is a tipping point for me.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, I'm really, really big.

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So I want to just say thanks again to the entire team.

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So many people worked on this.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Besides, I hear my mouth here.

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's dark, not blond.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Our UK crew, of course,

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
under expert leadership of James Bedford and Woody Glaskow.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But, you know, everyone pitched in and worked so hard.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We had five people with editing stations.

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We had five people doing camera.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Of course, we had all our hosts.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We had everyone from the office pitching in.

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
However, they could doing anything,

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
carrying crosses, serving drinks,

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
grabbing sea liberties,

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and deal liberties to bring them down to our party.

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It was great.

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And, of course, in San Francisco,

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
quite a big crew working on keeping the streams up,

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
including the good folks over at Akamai,

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
who at one point did have some issues.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I think we had eight or nine thousand concurrent viewers,

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and they had to switch some stuff,

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
because I don't think they were expecting that kind of traffic either from us.

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
At least Aaron's, of course,

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
who has really brought this project to life.

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If you haven't seen it yet,

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
check out theplustv.com.

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Just a taste of where some of the things are headed

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
to some interface stuff.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And, of course, November December,

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
as when we're going to see a whole brand new podshow.com.

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I telling you, we're working stiffs.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We're actually working for singing for our supper these days.

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Now, I do have a small beef folks in the UK.

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So I haven't done a show for the past one, two, three days.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Three days, no show.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And when I check into the voicemail,

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
not a single call from the UK.

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Shame on you.

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Plus, four, four, two, seven,

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three,

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
plus four, four, two, seven,

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three.

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hey, it being maximum music,

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
maximum mashup music,

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
full bar Friday.

173
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's jump right into the goodness with a young palette hit-off.

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
One girl in casting with Adam Curry.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hey, Adam, are you ready to be stopped?

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm ready.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm ready.

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm ready.

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm ready.

180
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm ready.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Adam, it's just a hit-off number 90,

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and this is in-drawn number one.

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh, y'all don't do this to me.

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I think the way to deal with that is.

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm a whole note to me, the other two.

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Level 42.

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We're there.

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Living without you, something like that?

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Level 42 for sure.

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay.

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I've got one going there.

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And this is number three.

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Buffalo.

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's easy.

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Huh.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
A nanacherry.

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Buffalo stance.

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think number one was hollow notes, but I'm not sure.

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let me hear the answers, young.

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And times up in detail, the answers.

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
From 1985, yeah, hall and notes, and out of touch.

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Tap, tap.

204
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
She's getting up is all men with no.

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You think the body of this week.

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh, yeah.

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you ride a touch?

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're not a touch.

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're not a touch.

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're not a touch.

211
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're not a touch.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You're not a touch.

213
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You're not a touch.

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're not a touch.

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You're not a touch.

216
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Nice work.

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Nice work.

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And you're not a row.

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Answer number one, hall and notes.

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes.

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And this is answer number two from 1986.

222
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Level 42 and something about you.

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
How can it be?

224
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Better love.

225
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Come, better can't reach.

226
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Be kind of like something about you.

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Baby.

228
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So ride.

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I couldn't leave.

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Level 42 and answer number two.

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And this is answer number three.

232
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes.

233
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And then it's Harry.

234
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
From 1989.

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes.

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Who's that fellow?

237
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We're dancing.

238
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We're dancing.

239
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We're not a touch.

240
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's sweet.

241
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We are singing a photo of those stamps.

242
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We can dance.

243
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And you love baby night, man.

244
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I need nothing left in chance.

245
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So don't leave.

246
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Fresh with me.

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Buffalo stands for Manicherry's.

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Answer number three.

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And that concludes hit tests number 90.

250
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
10 more to go, man.

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The iTunes links can be found at hittest.partshow.com.

253
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:01,000
show.com. And next week I'll be back for hit test number 91. So, until next time, take care.

254
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And bye-bye.

255
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
A young sent a little accompanying note with today's hit test saying,

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I had my compressor wasn't working. I hope it doesn't suck too bad.

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yon, it's still the wall of sound man, no matter what you do.

258
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Good tracks. Definitely good tracks. Oh man, it was so funny to see Christina at the digital

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
musical awards. And because she knows a lot of these bands. She was very disappointed.

260
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Of course, the block party wasn't there. I think they won like four awards.

261
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I've very own Jill Mills, by the way, won an award for the block party video podcast,

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
which she produces, congratulations to Jill. Nice to see that her loose-site award was stolen.

263
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This is very same night of the awards. She was busy doing segments for the plus.

264
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And someone stole it. Nice.

265
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Christina was basically trying to get the guys from Hadoogan,

266
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
which turns out is a local gulfard band.

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We have some kick-ass tunes. We're playing the video on the plus right now.

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The plus TV.com. She was like, hey, why don't you guys go get me a drink from the bar?

269
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
She was making the band get her drinks. Oh, it was too funny.

270
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And then I think she got an offer to be driven home by lethal visual,

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
which she respectfully declined. And she was hanging out with the guy from the guys from the rakes.

272
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And she knew all these guys. She's seen him perform.

273
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I saw them like two months ago with the back line.

274
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So she's totally into it and was totally in her element. And of course,

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
looked totally mini-me. She was completely like the lady Patricia,

276
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
who was there in her beautiful red dress.

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Somewhere there was an interview I think that Amanda Davies did.

278
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They were both about Amanda. We brought her in. She works typically.

279
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
She works for BBC Sports.

280
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But she's a producer and man, she did a great job on a lot of this music stuff.

281
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Speaking of awards, just a quicker rewind back to the podcast new media,

282
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
new media. The podcast, the new media expo.

283
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The new media expo in Ontario, Canada.

284
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I was a bit disappointed myself with the actual awards ceremonies,

285
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and such a, to do was made about it in the potto sphere.

286
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Hey, Adam Curry. This is Nick Jackson from the Bay Area in California.

287
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm just calm to give a little bit of feedback.

288
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
One, I just listened to Father Rodger on the daily breakfast.

289
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He actually recorded some of the award ceremony for the podcast awards.

290
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And I got a green and a pretty random award show.

291
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I was hoping for a lot of time to give some good speeches.

292
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Really thankful listeners talk about community interpreters.

293
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Twenty-second blurb to give the...

294
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah, like we had network news to hit at the top of the hour.

295
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
We only limited it to speak for 20 seconds.

296
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Side of your podcast, which was pretty weak, but anyway.

297
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Let's do that right next year, guys.

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
If it's going to be in Vegas, let's do a big extravagant Vegas award show.

300
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Do real awards.

301
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
By the way, I got to look for that email.

302
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I mean, I can find it.

303
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I was asked.

304
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
There's someone setting up new awards.

305
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And I just wanted to give my opinion on that.

306
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Let me see if I can find it.

307
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, here we go.

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I guess it's...

309
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
P-dilled.

310
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So I guess it's podcast pickle.

311
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He and Brian A bit from Coverville are starting a new awards for podcasters.

312
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And they're compiling a panel of 50 judges to help decide who wins.

313
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So they've got a lot of people on me.

314
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You know what?

315
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Here's my thing about awards.

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't want to judge anyone's show.

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Because that's basically what we're trying to move away from.

318
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I think.

319
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Who's to say that my show is no good.

320
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If I only have 10 people and I have crappy production.

321
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And I can barely speak.

322
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's good for those 10 people.

323
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So it just doesn't make any sense to have an award show.

324
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Because we don't have a limited channel space or shelf space or anything like that.

325
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm just against it.

326
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And it's the same thing like podcast user magazine.

327
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Does reviews and rates shows.

328
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
By saying, well, this show sucks.

329
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Production is no good.

330
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Guy talks stupid.

331
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You know, who is anyone to criticize any type of podcast?

332
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Whatever.

333
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It just seems like it's not encouraging to me.

334
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And a lot of the same people will always be winning because the way these awards are set up with.

335
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You know, basically the bigger audience.

336
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's not the same audience voting.

337
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's everyone's individual audience.

338
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And so the biggest audience is by default going to win.

339
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I saw what was it.

340
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I got a business week.

341
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Best of the web.

342
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Manchin.

343
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I wasn't really an award for the daily source code.

344
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That was nice.

345
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I appreciate that.

346
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I have no idea how that came to be or who determines that.

347
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Hopefully, just the business week and editors.

348
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
No, no, no, no, no.

349
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Awards.

350
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And even a PR company's love this shit.

351
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, man.

352
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The times that our PR firms who have come and gone.

353
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I might say, you've said, no, you've got to do an award show.

354
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm like, no, it's fucking stupid.

355
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I hate award shows.

356
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah, but the press loves it.

357
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It said, well, then tough shit.

358
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Then we just don't do any press.

359
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It don't like doing award shows.

360
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I think it's degrading and silly.

361
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
More important things to talk about.

362
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I also wanted to give a little bit of.

363
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I wanted to give you a couple of little red pills that you could drop.

364
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm reading on the board's dilemma by Michael Polin right now.

365
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And this thing has just been now read.

366
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm looking right right at me.

367
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And I'm just going to read you a little bit of.

368
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
A little excerpt from the book.

369
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
All right.

370
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We've been studying the journal of the medical association.

371
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
predict that a child born in 2000 has a one and three chance of developing diabetes.

372
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
African American child chances are two and five.

373
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Because of diabetes and all the other health problems that a company will be for these days.

374
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Obviously today's children may turn out to be the first generation of American who's like expecting

375
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
see will actually be shorter than their parents.

376
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Because of over nutrition.

377
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I think is what it is.

378
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm not limited to America.

379
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The United Nations reported that in 2000.

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The number of people suffering from over nutrition.

381
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
A billion.

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Can you believe that shit over nutrition is not amazing.

383
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And that's what has become.

384
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
My goodness.

385
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Crazy.

386
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The world is crazy.

387
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Look this more shit.

388
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's crazy.

389
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Check this out.

390
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Hi.

391
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
My name is Rebecca Nay from Traini Recradio and the rights of my community are under attack.

392
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives have decided to strip protections for transgender people

393
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
from the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.

394
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Also known as Enda.

395
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Due to fears that it would likely be defeated if it included a transgender provision.

396
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This action by our Democratic leaders has the potential to divide the LGBT community.

397
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
This is ultimately what our opponents want and we can't let this happen.

398
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Call or email your representative now and urge them to oppose

399
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
a non-inclusive end-up bill.

400
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I appreciate your support.

401
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You can let me up.

402
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And Patricia heard this promo and she said,

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Adam, you've definitely got to play that.

404
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What kind of messed up shit is that?

405
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So there you go.

If you want a whole shit load of mashups to drop onto your MP3 player,

413
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
you'll dig it, including this one from the club tour.

414
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's all the same.

415
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Only the names will change everyday.

416
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It seems we'll waste it in a way.

417
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
We're in the place where the baits is also cold.

418
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000

I've seen a million faces and I've rocked him off as I'm a cowboy on a steel house that I ride

471
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:33,660
That's messed up different brightening the UK they are the best of booty

472
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:41,660
2006 CD to club tones, careless or dead von Joey versus George Michael it's almost perfect

473
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,100
Unbelievable how the club tones got this to fit and what's so messed up about this is

474
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:55,100
You know how I talk about the soundtrack to our lives and of course I know exactly where I was when I first heard George Michael's careless whisper as

475
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,380
I do know for dead or alive from Bond Joey and

476
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,140
It's like

477
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:08,060
It's a memory mashup in my head and it's really conflicting because I remember the girlfriend I was with during careless whisper yet

478
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,460
Dead or alive was

479
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:16,380
Early MTV days for me and that's very two two very different periods of my life

480
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,020
So mashup memories live more from that best of booty

481
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:26,620
2006 CD which you're just going to love everything is downloadable again link in the show notes

482
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:32,860
Speaking of the soundtrack to our lives hey Adam it's Bernie and I just had the perfect storm of podcasting in my ear

483
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:41,020
But I'm driving down around 17 and you know where that is and I'm listening to the end of your podcast and you start playing the load out

484
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
I got to tell you

485
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,780
Yeah, it just made it all very special for me at that time knowing I'm in your home state

486
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,580
Listen into you play one of your favorite tunes. It's one of mine too for anybody who's ever done a show

487
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,980
Or fit on the road or been on that dark stage looking at into that house with house

488
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:02,700
It's a great time. So thanks for sharing another piece of the soundtrack for your life and of mine

489
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,780
Appreciate it. Oh, man. Can I just imagine driving down route 17 listening to that? Yes, I can

490
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
Awesome to thank you

491
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:19,580
You know, I've told you about the the McCains. This is the young like three or four-year-old

492
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,900
Madeline McCain who was allegedly abducted from their vacation

493
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:31,740
bungalow or a apartment in Portugal and this thing has been a world news

494
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,620
Now talk about your perfect storm

495
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,500
So about two months ago. I think I mentioned this who hooked up with

496
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,460
With the guy named Gordon Smith. He is the spirit messenger

497
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,260
This is a guy who does grief counseling. He literally

498
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:54,380
Speaks to the dead and let me tell you this guy is for all intents and purposes as far as I'm concerned this guy is the real deal

499
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,900
And who was talking so loudly down there? Who on a second? I can't get into my vibe

500
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,980
All right, I'm back in the vibe now

501
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:12,620
So this guy who used to be known as the psychic barber, which I think he's trying to get away from

502
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:20,220
That's not exactly the kind of business that he's that he's in. I mean, he literally he actually he won't take money for a reading

503
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,220
He gives a

504
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,860
Symposium and conferences and he writes lots of books and very very famous in the UK

505
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,340
But what has happened is

506
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:34,620
And this is an every single newspaper in the UK. It's been this way for the past week

507
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:41,500
That the McCain's apparently have approached him to do a reading to see if they can find out what happened to Maddie

508
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,860
And can you believe that we actually just shot our first series of shows with Gordon Smith

509
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,860
Which are supposed to start running. I think

510
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,220
Not this coming Sunday, but the Sunday after next

511
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,860
So yeah, and let's go in like 10 days from now or less yet 10 days from now

512
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:03,900
And it would be of course phenomenal if we got the McCain's on the show. I don't know if that's gonna happen, but

513
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:11,260
It's phenomenal this guy when you see his show when you see what he does and he did he does that for regular people, right?

514
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,460
So not for for celebrities not for any again. He doesn't charge any money for it

515
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,420
He's purely doing this to try and help people when you see this show. It's it's gonna freak you out

516
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,340
But it's also just gonna give you goosebumps because he does really help people

517
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,900
Feel much better after they have had some sort of communication with with the deceased

518
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,900
Spirit messenger Gordon Smith be on a lookout for him

519
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,140
Exclusively on pod show amazing amazing. Amazing how that shit just came together

520
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,780
Ah, so so much coming up. I told you until the end of the year. It's just gonna be crazy busy

521
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,300
And I'm gonna be lacking on shows and running all over the world and just trying to make stuff better

522
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,500
Make it all work for you. Here's the question that came in that I definitely want to answer again

523
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,380
Hi, this is Wayne. I'm a listener from the US

524
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,260
I had a comment in a question. I've got an awesome and I was listening to

525
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,980
John C. DeVorac this tech five report and I was looking at it all my

526
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:11,420
His new seed his DeVorac and censored new seed on my iPhone and that's where I saw the tech five report

527
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,340
Well when I access the web page like on a computer. I get a flash player to play the episode

528
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:24,460
But on my iPhone he put like a quick time link so that I can listen to the show on my iPhone and I thought that was really like cool

529
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,940
So then I tried going to pod show to see if maybe I could do the same thing with a

530
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,220
A channel I created but I wasn't able to figure out how to do that

531
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,100
Maybe it's not even possible

532
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,300
Oops, sorry forgot to open the mic. Yeah, first of all, let me say

533
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,380
We have an undocumented feature which we have not released publicly yet John and I I think it the only ones who are using it

534
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,780
When you upload a show

535
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,780
to pod show

536
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:57,500
You can configure it again. It's it's not documented. It's not publicly released yet, but it can be configured so it will automatically crosspost

537
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,020
To a WordPress blog so if you look at curie dot com you'll see it's the exact same show notes

538
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,660
What is added is a download link a direct download link to the mp3 file

539
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,740
Which is probably what you're what you're hitting off of DeVorac dot org slash blog

540
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,380
And it also will add in a link to

541
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,620
for comments to the actual

542
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,300
Episode archive page on pod show dot com so that's what you're seeing there so that is

543
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,620
Indeed something that is a little special and has not been released publicly

544
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,660
I know a lot of people have been asking for it a lot of people want it so it will it will surface

545
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,420
With you know with do time we're just gonna make sure it's scalable and then everything works perfectly because

546
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:44,540
Shit does happen from time to time when you're talking from one server to another one and the two aren't really related other than this

547
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,980
You know minor connection that it's making so that's what you're seeing there

548
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,940
Yeah, if I could create a channel and listen to it on my eyes and that would be like really great

549
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
um

550
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

551
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,900
All right, so I know what happened you so if you haven't used the channel editor at podshow.com

552
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,140
You really should because this thing is fantastic it gives you the opportunity to create channels

553
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,740
Of as many shows if you want but also to determine how many episodes will actually surface in your feed

554
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,660
So you can already kind of automatically manage how much information is coming in

555
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,820
You can even put single episodes in there that just stay

556
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,540
You know if you just want to have one episode that's in there or if we want to create a a feed of

557
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:30,780
Individual episodes for someone else you can just create that if nothing will update it'll change until you change it

558
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,220
And we had to make some choices because you'll you'll see that you know if you want to subscribe to a channel

559
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,420
There's a number of ways to do it and one of them is put this on my iPod

560
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,300
So that is kind of typically what you use to put it on to your iPhone however

561
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,580
I've found before I I bricked my

562
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,580
Brick my iPhone by drowning it in the toilet

563
00:30:52,220 --> 00:31:00,300
I found that if you click on the RSS icon or if you just ask for the raw XML when you when you configure it so make your channel

564
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,460
Right then zoom in with your little pinch move there zoom in and

565
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:12,860
And click on the RSS icon which is that little orange and white kind of like a transmitter icon emitting thing

566
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:19,180
The way the iPhone is set up it will actually give you a page a bookmarkable page of

567
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,060
Your channel and from there you can just click it and it'll automatically

568
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,380
Open up the file it'll start streaming it in it works great for video

569
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,820
It does fantastic for audio of course. You can't actually save this to the device

570
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:37,500
But you can play it in real times if you've created a channel and you want to see it on your iPhone to

571
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,300
Go to your channel zoom in click on the RSS icon and

572
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,740
Automatically a page that you can bookmark will appear on your iPhone that then you can use in perpetuity

573
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,500
I use it every single day back when the ship was still working

574
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,260
Behind all my DSC yet. I say it's if you've covered this. It's okay, but part of the reason is is that my

575
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,900
ISP wonly allow me

576
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,980
150 megabytes oh no for our period so no when I knock out it like

577
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:11,740
You know cut off my computer for 24 hours so it's really kind of a crappy deal

578
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,300
But it's the only choice I've got living in the country here

579
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,860
So you know

580
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:22,140
Anything that could help would be a great so okay. You got it there's anything I can do with pot show

581
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,140
Yeah, it's done

582
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,100
Hello, hello

583
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,900
Oh

584
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,900
Hang up I guess

585
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,700
So that's it. It's real simple. Hey, we're supposed to go to Germany

586
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,660
Either Sunday or Monday or perhaps Tuesday. Not quite sure

587
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:43,980
And in case it wasn't clear it definitely looks like Paul's Dom is going to be

588
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,620
The new home of PSG which would be pod so pod show pod show Germany

589
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:56,220
I could not be more excited particularly on a day like today when I'm thinking yeah

590
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,220
It'd be nice to fly over to Berlin

591
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,300
And you're right. I'm more slowly teased you all through the payment. Yeah, I admit it

592
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,940
I noticed what it is about you. It makes me want to tease you

593
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,060
But I heard what you said about my sticky lip gloss you brat and I heard

594
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:24,780
Are you sure it was lips either lip gloss lips lob lip gloss? You gossiping about me with Don and Drew

595
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,740
Notty naughty boy and

596
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,060
And you also stole my butt plug joke. What a brat

597
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Anyways

598
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,660
Song for you and it's not love spirals although there are plenty of those up on

599
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,820
PMN right now, but I was song that I think fits

600
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,940
This weekend very well because I know some secrets about you that you may not think I know

601
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,700
What you did or tried to do at the expo you naughty man

602
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,860
And so this song is by bittersweet and it's called dirty laundry

603
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,780
Singe the link

604
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:07,100
And by the way, yeah, if I had realized when you invited me up to your private sweet that it was just to make a pod cast

605
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
I would have so ban there

606
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Don

607
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,100
All right, Angie go ahead

608
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,300
I dare you. What did you find out about me? I already told everybody

609
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:23,020
I'm a horrible boy. I'm proposition every one of the five women who were at the portable

610
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,580
New new new new new new new new dexpo

611
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,620
New media that's what it's got to be called for now on

612
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,140
It's a good one Friday with bitter sweeps dirty boundary

613
00:34:46,300 --> 00:35:15,740
I've got a bad boy and that's all

614
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,500
I wish me

615
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,660
Just dirty laundry is nothing but I can't get paid

616
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,220
And when you need to nullify

617
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,140
You can use all night

618
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,140
Oh

619
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,140
I'm just too bad girl that's why we're getting

620
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,380
No

621
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,260
Oh

622
00:36:30,140 --> 00:37:00,140
Oh, when you're out of this way, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

623
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:07,240
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

624
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:19,200
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, okay, right here, excitedly,

626
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:35,140
I think I rather miss way ahead of you

627
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,140
You're awake

628
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,140
Was a fun day inside you

629
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,140
Think I'd rather miss way ahead of you

630
00:37:52,140 --> 00:38:11,400
Wohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohoho god atta

631
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,200
You're afraid will swallow fireworks fall into pieces and there's a dream when shine reflections.

632
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:36,320
Yeah, nice one, Angie, I like it.

633
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:44,880
By the way, was it not amazing that I got that USB lava lamp in the shape of a rocket

634
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,880
from Skip G. And I put it in my bag, my carry-on bag, and so here's a rocket-shaped

635
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:59,480
liquid-filled device with a cord attached to it that got through no problem. I got to love

636
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:06,600
the security of the American airports. Particularly when they kill people. Let's see, did

637
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,240
you hear about this? Let me see. I thought I actually have a comment about it checking out.

638
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,840
Hey Adam, this is Bob Evans and Birmingham, Alabama shopping at Walmart. Well, I was listening

639
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:22,240
to the DSC and you were going on about the TSA and after getting the woman's name and

640
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,080
what part of the country, but somewhere over here, some woman was putting custody because

641
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,880
she was just acting up too much when she couldn't get on the airplane that she was

642
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,160
looking at and she died while she was in the holding tank. So I just thought that might

643
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:43,600
kind of line up with the TSA story from hell. So anyway, I thought you might get a, just

644
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,640
you wouldn't get a kick out of that since it's a very unpleasant ending, but isn't

645
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,080
an interesting that you're going off on TSA and that happens. Yeah. Yeah, this is very

646
00:39:54,080 --> 00:40:01,080
unclear. September 28, Carol and Gottbaum was arrested and put into a holding cell in

647
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,880
that Phoenix Sky Harbor airport because she was I rate. She was I, you know, I tried

648
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,120
to see the CNN video, which is an embedded video and it's just not working. It was posted

649
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:17,120
by Chris from the Captain Chris from the Plain Maddenes podcast and unfortunately, it's

650
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:23,120
just not playing back very well. But she choked to death in her in the holding cell and

651
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:28,320
the TSA are saying, oh, you know, that's because she was trying to go out of her handcuffs

652
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,000
and she inadvertently choked herself. Yeah. Yeah. That happens a lot. Doesn't it? I read

653
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,560
about that and I see that on cops every single day. That doesn't sound right. I think

654
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:45,240
that she might have just been so upset and emotional that she might have choked on something

655
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:53,960
somehow, but seems highly unlikely that that happened. John, you Dell posted today. Where

656
00:40:53,960 --> 00:41:00,200
was it? John Udella, who's a quite famous in the blogosphere? Hmm. I said, I should

657
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,320
be home by now, but instead I'm writing this in O'Hare Terminal B. Why? Well, here's the

658
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:09,800
dialogue as I prepared to board at C-TAC this morning, the United Agent. Where's the TSA

659
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:16,240
stamp on your boarding path? Me, stamp? United Agent. Yeah. They have to rubber stamp them

660
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,800
now and they've missed you. No, for God's sake. I had to hop back on the shuttle train,

661
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,720
head back to the main terminal where a dollar TSA guy padded me down and right about

662
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,120
the time the door to my plane was closing stamped my now useless boarding pass. Oh, but it

663
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,960
made me feel so much safer. Yeah. I've noticed this. This is the new thing. Where the idiots

664
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,680
at the front of the line are just there to look at your ticket, look at your passport.

665
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,160
Don't even look at me. In fact, I'm now wearing sunglasses when I go through a TSA just

666
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,360
to see if it makes a dip. They don't even ask me to take them off and give a shit. To

667
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,400
share my tell you. Oh, next week I want to get back into following the money stuff

668
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,640
because a lot of good comments have been coming in. It's just it's been it's been a

669
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:06,800
little bit crazy. Yes, so speaking of my lava lamp. Hey, Adam, your TSA buddies are at it

670
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,840
again. I just thought I'd let you know that in the Houston Chronicles on CNN they're

671
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,720
talking about the fact that people aren't going to be able to bring their remote controlled

672
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:23,800
toys on the airplane anymore. There goes your vibrator, Adam, bummer. Oh, well, bummer.

673
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,240
I can take the batteries out, but it'll be alright. No pun intended. Yeah. Yeah. Now, I'm going

674
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,680
to keep traveling with that lava lamp, dude. That because it looks totally like a go away.

675
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:44,120
Oh, hold on a second. Okay. I think that's Candyman Luke from Nokia. He's been up my

676
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,800
ass for the past week and I just have paid no attention to anybody who've been so incredibly

677
00:42:47,800 --> 00:43:00,040
busy. Also in the news, this is pretty interesting. The R I I the R I A A lawsuit against a single

678
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,600
a single mother of two. I love the way the press always writes that. Files were liable for

679
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:11,800
copyright infringement for sharing files on Kazah. $222,000 is the fine that will be levied

680
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,720
against her, which means she'll pay it one way or the other. That's pretty amazing. You know,

681
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,840
and even if she was file sharing, you know, is it really a quarter of a million dollars worth

682
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:30,440
of damages for one person to be sharing files? Particularly now that records are now being given

683
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:37,640
away. Radiohead, you know, you choose the price Charlotton's or Charlotton's UK no price free.

684
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:43,560
This is all changing very, very quickly. This is probably, I would predict this is going to be one of

685
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:52,920
the last big fines or awards we'll see in this type of litigation. It's it's just not sustainable.

686
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,600
You know, the litigation costs three, maybe four times as much. There's no way that it makes

687
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:04,520
any business sense to be doing this. Yeah, that's the voicemail message. Can't wait to hear

688
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:10,200
what to Candyman Lucas to say. Okay, so who knows what's going to happen this weekend?

689
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,240
I may be going to Berlin on Sunday. I really hope that I have time to do a couple of shows next week,

690
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,400
because honestly, you can ask Patricia. I'm really out of sorts. It's pissing me off, and you know,

691
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,720
I got up. It's like, it's nine o'clock. I've got to be upstairs. I've got to do my show. I've got to get

692
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:30,440
this going because it's just killing me. I can't. Not doing shows. Football Friday, we're wrapping

693
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,000
up with another one from a Best of Goody 2006 CD, Hill Shirt, and Fox Problems.

694
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:59,240
Let me hear your love. Let me grow. Oh, you know, you know, heartbreaker.

695
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,560
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, love maker.

696
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:43,240
Let me see. Now, I see you. I'm down on the scene.

697
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:55,560
Oh, Foxy. You may be, you want to get up and scream, Foxy.

698
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:05,960
Oh, baby, listen up. I need a fuck about this. I'm tired of waiting for my precious time.

699
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:16,120
You've got to be on it all night. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see.

700
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:55,320
I'm gonna take your home. I will do you no harm, no. You've got to be on it all night.

701
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:09,400
Foxy, ladies. Come on, they give you everything.

702
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:39,400
I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it

703
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:50,240
I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it, I've got to pull it

704
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
I'm gonna fly home home to watch a baby

705
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,240
I'm gonna fly in my land

706
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,240
I'm gonna fly home to watch a baby

707
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,240
I like to breathe on my head

708
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,240
Let me go

709
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,240
Let me go all over

710
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,240
Let me go

711
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,240
Let me let me go

712
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,240
Let me go all over

713
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,240
Let me go

714
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,240
Let me go

715
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,240
Let me go

716
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Let me go

717
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,240
Let me go

718
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,240
Let me go

719
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,240
Let me go

720
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,240
Let me go

721
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,240
Let me go

722
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,240
Let me go

723
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,240
Let me go

724
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,240
Let me go

725
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,240
Let me go

726
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,240
Let me go

727
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,240
Let me go

728
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,240
I don't know about you, but that gets me in the mood for the weekend.

729
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,240
Tiltured.

730
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,240
Master of Jimmy Hendrix, Jimmy Bowhorn, airfield and rock team to bring you...

731
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,240
Fuck.

732
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,240
Problem.

733
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,240
Again, it's all on the best of booty, 2006 AD.

734
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,240
Show, links in the show notes at datasourcecode.com.

735
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,240
Yeah.

736
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:14,240
By the way, that was not the candy man who was calling that was will.

737
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,240
Ah.

738
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,240
The German connection.

739
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,240
Mm-hmm.

740
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,240
We'll ramp it up, getting ready looking for us to arrive.

741
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,240
What the hell is it today?

742
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,240
It's Friday.

743
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,240
Monday Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday.

744
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,240
I'm Friday.

745
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,240
I don't find a fun only.

746
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,240
We'll have to be very honest.

747
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,240
It just didn't have much time to think this week.

748
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,240
It was all execution mode.

749
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,240
Production.

750
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,240
Doing shit.

751
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,240
Getting shit done.

752
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,240
Doing doing.

753
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,240
Not just talking.

754
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,240
Um.

755
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,240
Here's what I'd like you to do for next week.

756
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,240
I'd like you to just do a little bit of homework.

757
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,240
It's really easy.

758
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:54,240
Just be on the lookout for stories about central banking, currency exchanges.

759
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,240
And anything really that has to do with global finance.

760
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,240
Because I think that there's some moves are going to be made very soon.

761
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,240
Um, and this is all part of the follow the money.

762
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,240
You know, let's just forget about, let's not forget, but I just want to put some things in the past

763
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:15,240
behind us and move forward and see if we can change our future because I really do feel that

764
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:20,240
following the money will lead us to where our leaders want to take us.

765
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,240
And we just may not agree with what they want to do.

766
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:28,240
Now add to that that it seems very likely that the United States is going to make a quote,

767
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,240
surgical strike on Iran.

768
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:36,240
We really have to step up here as citizens of the United States certainly,

769
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,240
but I see no reason why citizens of the United Kingdom could not do exactly the same.

770
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,240
We really have to manage our governments.

771
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,240
They work for you and I.

772
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:51,240
And we've got to manage them so that they basically do what is reflective of the majority.

773
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,240
So far, either we're not in the majority,

774
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:58,240
people who are against all this insanity or we're just not doing it right.

775
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,240
Something is definitely very wrong.

776
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,240
If you listen to that end promo earlier from Tranny Rack,

777
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:12,240
if you think about how central banks are really controlling a lot of what's happening in the economy,

778
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,240
and what is going on with the dollar?

779
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,240
Excuse me, the hell is wrong?

780
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,240
Things are not good.

781
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,240
They just don't feel right.

782
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,240
So let's follow the money, all those stories.

783
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,240
Nylon, where the hell are you?

784
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,240
Aren't you in this business?

785
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,240
Don't you understand this kind of stuff?

786
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,240
Call in.

787
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,240
We need to understand what's going on.

788
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,240
You've been away too long, my friend.

789
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,240
All right, so I hope all of you have a great weekend.

790
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,240
You know, don't get too freaked out.

791
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,240
Just chill out over the weekend.

792
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,240
Relax a little bit.

793
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,240
Be with your loved ones.

794
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,240
But follow the money.

795
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,240
Keep your eye on the ball.

796
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
Remember to take the red pill.

797
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,240
And I look forward to talking to you next week.

798
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,240
Probably from Germany.

799
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,240
Have a great weekend, everybody.

800
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,240
Bye-bye.

801
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,240
I'm gonna introduce everyone.

802
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,240
Take those day food by Friday.

803
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,240
Adam's final thought on the week.

804
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,240
Another part show podcast.

805
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Stick it in your ear.

806
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,240
The best in the brightest served up daily

807
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,240
by the sharpest minds and content delivery.

808
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,240
Pudge-o in limite.
