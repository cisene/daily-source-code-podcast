1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It was a tough day on the beat, murder, scum, clean up the streets, and the king pin was

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
still in the loose.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,200
I got back to my apartment, kicked off my shoes, sat in my favorite chair, and jam the

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,000
earbuds in my ears to listen to the DSC 627.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
content in my ears.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,500
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
I've got some more

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500

I've got some more

70
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
I've got some more

71
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,500
It's not lonely, maybe blue or whatever you is what we're looking for

72
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
We got to play it till you feel happy

73
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Till there ain't no more love

74
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Until there ain't no more love

75
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:28,500
We got to play it till you feel happy

76
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Till there ain't no more love

77
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Till there ain't no more love

78
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Reach out to jail

79
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
If it's the moment

80
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Jesus, I can get out of the way

81
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Reach out to jail

82
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Reach out to jail

83
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Reach out to jail

84
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Reach out to jail

85
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Reach out to jail

86
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Reach out to jail

87
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Reach out to jail

88
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Reach out to jail

89
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Reach out to jail

90
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Reach out to jail

91
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Reach out to jail

92
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Reach out to jail

93
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Reach out to jail

94
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Reach out to jail

95
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
alk away

96
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

97
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

98
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

99
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

100
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

101
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

102
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

103
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

104
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

105
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

106
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

107
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

108
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

109
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

110
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

111
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

112
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

113
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
I don't know why you thought of living

114
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

115
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
I don't know what you think, but I don't know what you think

116
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,780
Tom, I had a wild Jesus Rigby.

117
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,820
Of course, I dipped into the official mashup pool of the Charlie.

118
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,220
That would be mashuptown.com to find this one for you.

119
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,820
For episode number 627 of the Daily Source Code mixed up, I had a wild blue Beatles

120
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,580
Eleanor Rigby, and Eleanor Rigby, and of course to Pashmode's personal Jesus.

121
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,580
Love that.

122
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,140
From two time, of course, I put a link in the show notes at Daily Source Code so you

123
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,140
can find out more.

124
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,860
And listen to the song over and over and over again.

125
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
Perhaps put it on your iPhone.

126
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,860
Yeah, yeah.

127
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,860
That's right.

128
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,860
I'm here in the UK with nothing but a big iPod iPhone envy.

129
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,860
You know that if I was in the States, you know, well, I wouldn't stand in line

130
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,860
for anything.

131
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,860
And certainly not for food.

132
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,860
I don't stand in line.

133
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,860
And not to get something.

134
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,860
I don't think our parents fought in the Second World War for us to stand in line

135
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,860
for any reason whatsoever.

136
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,860
But I certainly would have dropped by today and gotten one.

137
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,860
In fact, I've already procured one, and it's being FedEx to me, which of course

138
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,860
has me all nervous because for the first time in my life there's going to be

139
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,860
a cell phone that you have to activate via iTunes.

140
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,860
And I do have a US iTunes Music Store account.

141
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
So hopefully that'll work.

142
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,860
Of course, I am an existing singular customer.

143
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,860
I believe I'm a business customer, which means my activation is probably going to

144
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,860
be completely host.

145
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
But we'll see.

146
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,860
I've been, you know, surfing around, looking at what people are saying about it.

147
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,860
And it seems that the interface really lives up to the video, which was, of course,

148
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,860
for me was the most interesting part is, you know, these commercial looks so incredibly

149
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,860
slick.

150
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,860
Does the iPhone actually function that slick?

151
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,860
And that appears to be so.

152
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,860
I know where he's.

153
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,860
I, I caressed my E61 eye a couple times over the weekend to make her feel okay.

154
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,860
She's been performing just beautifully for me.

155
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,860
Everything's in there, everything I need.

156
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,860
I'm, I'm hanging in, but well, we'll have to see.

157
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,860
I'll give you the field test when I receive one, of course.

158
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,860
I did see the Cali Lewis had a whole bunch of problems getting her account activated.

159
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,860
Actually, on Twitter, they had a pretty good, uh,

160
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,860
uh, mosh pit of reviews.

161
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,860
Uh, and I'd have to say, you know, everyone kind of duck it.

162
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,860
Hey, it's, uh, 230 in the afternoon on Monday here in the curry manner on the west side of

163
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,860
G-town.

164
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,860
I was supposed to take Patricia to rotted down this morning, but the weather is just so bad.

165
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,860
Now, you may not see it where you are because, you know, it rains and then, you know,

166
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,860
me a little bit of sunshine that pops through, but then it'll rain again.

167
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,860
Up top is really, really bad.

168
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,860
We've got winds, uh, gusting up to 35 knots, which is not a problem to fly in,

169
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,860
but it's definitely not something you want to be a passenger in.

170
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,860
In the back, being a passenger, you're going to get thrown about quite a bit.

171
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,860
In fact, then every aircraft has that, uh, only if you take a much larger aircraft,

172
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,860
like, uh, I don't know, an airbus.

173
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,860
You won't feel it quite that much as you would in, uh, in the Delta Sierra.

174
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:42,860
And this is, um, there's embedded CBs, so that means chemo is nimbus clouds, um,

175
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,860
embedded in the regular clouds.

176
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,860
So you could be flying along and thinking, oh, there's a little bit of cloud.

177
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
I'll, you know, I can go round it.

178
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,860
I'll just go through it and just go, uh, underneath it.

179
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,860
And there could be a huge, you know, a CB, a thunderstorm cloud in there,

180
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,860
with all kinds of crap going on.

181
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,860
You do not want to be in one of those because you have so many up and down drafts

182
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,860
that can shoot up, uh, sometimes these things go up until 30, 40,000 feet.

183
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,860
I mean, it's just amazing.

184
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,860
It would really what can happen is you can come out with bent wings.

185
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,860
You can be flipped upside down.

186
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,860
Uh, you can get pelted by hail.

187
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
Uh, you can get struck by lightning.

188
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,860
There's a lot of crap that goes on and then beautiful, fluffy cotton light clouds.

189
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,860
The best laid plans seldom become the desired outcome in a perfect world of business.

190
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,860
Alex controls every situation.

191
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,860
But when agreements fall to pieces and associates are winding up dead and new world emerges

192
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,860
and the bitch within finds new life to complete the final plays of the game.

193
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,860
Relying on the pure powers of sexual persuasion,

194
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,860
the rules have changed and the lines are crossed between business and the art.

195
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,860
And the art of sex and the realities of bitchiness.

196
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,860
From the imagination of Terry Woodard, ASB,

197
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,860
the art of sex and bitchiness,

198
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:06,860
where nothing is safe and the easiest way to befriend a foe is absolute sexual enticement.

199
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,860
Coming exclusively to pod show this summer,

200
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,860
the art of sex and bitchiness,

201
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,860
the erotic murder mystery that will make you second guess who you get into bed with.

202
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,860
I really recommend you listen to this audio novel.

203
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,860
It is outstanding.

204
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,860
I've heard the first episode is up and I listened to it.

205
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,860
It's actually, yeah, it's a prologue that is up now at ASB.podshow.com.

206
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,860
Mark Yoshimara Nymkov jumped all over this immediately.

207
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,860
I got to sign this for pod show press,

208
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,860
which is an initiative that is starting up as we speak.

209
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,860
Very similar to the pod-sick music network.

210
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,860
Only a couple of interesting twists.

211
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,860
And it will bring a lot more of this very successful format to the network.

212
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,860
The format of releasing a book in audio form,

213
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,860
episodically, chapter by chapter by chapter by chapter by chapter.

214
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
Chapter by chapter by chapter by chapter by chapter.

215
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,860
That's why we call it audio novels.

216
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,860
Really listen to this.

217
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,860
It's sexy.

218
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,860
It's hot.

219
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,860
It's like one of those fobio books.

220
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,860
Only you're listening to it.

221
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,860
And it adds some kind.

222
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,860
So you have your hands free, basically.

223
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,860
Hey, so I couldn't bring Patricia over.

224
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,860
So I called the KLM and booked her business class ticket.

225
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,860
For the one reason, really, so she could get around all the other crap lines.

226
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Of course, he throws still a little busy.

227
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,860
Not that bad.

228
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,860
I have to say terminal four.

229
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,860
But man, there's a whole other set of cops that are outside now.

230
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,860
It's not those, it's not, it's no Tommy with a Billy Club and one of those high helmet hats.

231
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,860
These guys are like bad ass.

232
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,860
So I've taken a picture.

233
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,860
I was afraid to probably get beat up on the spot.

234
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,860
They got massive hardware with them.

235
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,860
These guys, just in general are massive.

236
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,860
They've been growing some different kind of cops here in the UK, my friends.

237
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,860
So by the, actually, she probably is just about landing now.

238
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,860
And she'll be going for the rest of the week, which leaves me in charge of the manner,

239
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,860
which is always a tough job.

240
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
As you know, I can never get the cats in at night.

241
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,860
I can, I'm glad I get my daughter in at night.

242
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,860
She's off to go look at her new school, which should be going to in a couple of months.

243
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,860
And I'm all alone.

244
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,860
Just me alone in the attic with my trucker friends.

245
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,860
Oh, the random.

246
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,860
I got two times.

247
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,860
Yeah.

248
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,860
Two.

249
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,860
Two times here, man.

250
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,860
I just want my quick comment on the UK versus Bob Joe on video side.

251
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,860
It's you two versus Bob Joe on video side, buddy.

252
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,860
And say that, Bob Joe is lacking a lot on the interactivity on the people.

253
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,860
It's watching the videos being able to comment.

254
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,860
Yep.

255
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,860
And a live active counter and stuff for this.

256
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,860
And that, you know, like, it's worth on YouTube.

257
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,860
I make a lot of video stuff.

258
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,860
My travels and a lot of pod save music with some of them.

259
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,860
And make music videos even.

260
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,860
Yeah.

261
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,860
And then trucker two times.

262
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,860
I think took a.

263
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,860
Took a nod from a trucker Tom and has been creating videos of pod save music.

264
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,860
Well, road videos, basically, which are really.

265
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,860
Yes.

266
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,860
They're awesome.

267
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,860
You know, I put these these things in a channel and just playing one after another.

268
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,860
You get some great music and some entertaining visuals.

269
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,860
At least you get to see the world.

270
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,860
At least the North American part of it.

271
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,860
Of course, I give the creative stuff out of the pod safe music and the orders and stuff.

272
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,860
It done that.

273
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,860
But they're all up on YouTube.

274
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,860
I raise a few of it on pod, so.

275
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,860
But can't tell if anybody's even looking at it or not, though.

276
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,860
So, you know, been a show off.

277
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,860
You know, like, see, if they're even being noticed or what.

278
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,860
But that's one of the suck less items.

279
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,860
I think there could be help with pod show.

280
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,860
And I want to bring it to your page.

281
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,860
Man, see what your thoughts on that is.

282
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,860
So, just let you know, though, by the way,

283
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,860
I am a proud member of the folder, society.

284
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,860
Crazy folder, society.

285
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,860
And I'll tell you later, man.

286
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,860
I'm back quiet.

287
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,860
Yeah.

288
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
Catch on rebound.

289
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,860
Yeah, I think I understood where your question was.

290
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,860
So you said that we're doing okay on the videos that you upload.

291
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,860
Not to a show, but just the videos that are converted into flash and are embeddable.

292
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,860
In fact, I think our quality kicks YouTube's ass time and time again.

293
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,860
And we're going to do the 16 by nine player as well.

294
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,860
That's all common, damn it.

295
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,860
But indeed, there's no view count.

296
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,860
When you go to your videos, you can't see how many times it was viewed.

297
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,860
So itself, it's not visible either, however.

298
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,860
So this, of course, that's a mistake.

299
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,860
Of course, that's being worked on.

300
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,860
You can't, if you know the title of your video, search for it in video.

301
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:42,860
So you go to the search box and then type in the name of the video and then select video and then hit search.

302
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,860
Because the number of views are tallied up in the search results.

303
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,860
So the information is there, the information is in the system, but it's not surfacing the right place yet.

304
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,860
I told you that fuckers built upside down.

305
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,860
So that is forthcoming and you'll be able to see.

306
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,860
But right now, just as a crutch, you can take a look at how many people have viewed it.

307
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,860
I was amazed because I did go through a number of videos that I had posted.

308
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,860
And yeah, there were like a couple with 18, 19,000 different views.

309
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,860
A couple with four, 5,000.

310
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,860
A lot more than I thought, actually.

311
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,860
And I appreciate it.

312
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
Talker to time for you sending.

313
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,860
You comment and we're staying on the road for a minute.

314
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,860
Hey, Adam, what's up?

315
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,860
Trucker Tom here.

316
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,860
Been listening to you talk about the channels feature the pod show website.

317
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:34,860
I've kind of been scouring the web and scouring iTunes and scouring pod show for HD content for my Apple TV and to play on my computer.

318
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:42,860
I got the idea of setting up a channel that's nothing but Apple TV HD video content.

319
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:51,860
And as I find new video podcasts, HD video podcasts, I want to be adding those into the mix.

320
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,860
So I think that's a very interesting use for the channel concept.

321
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,860
Of course, you can find my audio podcast at truckertompodcast.com.

322
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,860
We'll catch you later.

323
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
This is exactly what I hope would happen.

324
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,860
Exactly.

325
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,860
Trucker Tom, thank you so much.

326
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,860
I did check out your HD video channel.

327
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Looks awesome.

328
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,860
I'm going to post a link.

329
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,860
Actually, I'll post a number of links.

330
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,860
I'll post an RSS link and an iTunes link.

331
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,860
On in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

332
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:30,860
So people can click on that and then immediately subscribe and iTunes, which of course will make it available on your Apple TV.

333
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:41,860
And also put the RSS feed in there for the the loyalist under us who were void anything from Cooper Tino when it comes to HD.

334
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,860
Yeah, I did a little bit more work over the weekend on the channels.

335
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,860
I also posted a video on curry.com of project cheddar.

336
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,860
So you see what's coming and how that's going to change.

337
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,860
And I'm very excited about it because this is something that we expect from the very beginning.

338
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,860
It's the entire architecture of the site is built around channels and built around RSS.

339
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,860
And now finally we're figuring out how to surface that stuff and what people want.

340
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,860
And well, of course, someone's going to come along and piss on my parade.

341
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:17,860
Let's have a word with the nylon spreading the news with the smile on where the roll is right.

342
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,860
We go for light.

343
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,860
Let's listen to the nylon.

344
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,860
Hey, Adam, I got cut off.

345
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,860
I'm going to try again.

346
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,860
And my point is enough with the channels.

347
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
I didn't ask for channels.

348
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,860
Who asked for the channels?

349
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,860
Ah, you see.

350
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,860
Let me stop you right there, nylon.

351
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,860
A lot of people have been asking you about the channels.

352
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,860
I haven't really asked for channels, but I've been asking about the channels.

353
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:47,860
And I think that this is going to be a real revolution in the way you collect and the way you share.

354
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,860
And the way you discover new programming.

355
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860
So who asked for it?

356
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
I did.

357
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
Bitch.

358
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
The geeks are running the country company.

359
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,860
You need to hire a heavy, heavy marketing person.

360
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,860
Yeah.

361
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:07,860
Who would launch channels at the same time that you're launching a huge survey to find out what your listeners want?

362
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,860
Again, nylon.

363
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,860
Go take another look, man.

364
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,860
Channel's have been there from day one.

365
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:19,860
So this is a natural path of progression through an iterative process with the users of the site.

366
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,860
A lot of the audience, but I have to say a lot of them podcasters.

367
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,860
And we'll only get more information and more data as we surface these things in a useful way.

368
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,860
And then, of course, when we have the survey, we'll be able to ask questions about it.

369
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,860
Because it's not one surveyed, Dork.

370
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,860
It's a super panel.

371
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
It's an ongoing process.

372
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,860
You'll get the test out new advertising.

373
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,860
New ways of advertising.

374
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
New songs.

375
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,860
It's a continuous panel.

376
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,860
In fact, the next survey is going up very, very soon.

377
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,860
I understand.

378
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,860
So have you signed up yet, nylon?

379
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,860
I would have thought you would have held your resources.

380
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,860
You found it.

381
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,860
What listeners want it?

382
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,860
And then jumped on those top four or five priorities.

383
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,860
Who asked for channels?

384
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,860
I don't want a channel.

385
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
Yeah.

386
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,860
B.C.

387
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
You don't know what you want.

388
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
You don't know what's good for you.

389
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,860
It's a feature, dude.

390
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,860
So it's not supposed to take away.

391
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,860
It's only supposed to add.

392
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,860
All right.

393
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,860
The other thing is, I have a channel.

394
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,860
You know what my channel is called?

395
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,860
My channel is called iTunes.

396
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
Yeah.

397
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,860
Unfortunately, you don't have a lot of control over the way your shows display

398
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,860
and iTunes and the way they play.

399
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,860
Unless you're doing exactly what we're setting out to do here,

400
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,860
which is making playlists, playlists of stuff.

401
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,860
And still, it's not going to be automatic because you have no control over how many episodes

402
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,860
come through from a single feed.

403
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,860
So you can't really create an entertainment experience that is tailored to time,

404
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,860
that is tailored to interest.

405
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,860
And one that you can easily share without overburdening people's experience,

406
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,860
because there would just too much media flowing all around.

407
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,860
And of course, iTunes is fantastic.

408
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,860
It's like, what did Job say?

409
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,860
There's like 500 million copies of iTunes?

410
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,860
Absolutely.

411
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,860
But if you want to make the process of managing what's in your iTunes,

412
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,860
and thus your iPod, and thus your iPhone, and thus your Apple TV,

413
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,860
you may want to give our channels a try,

414
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,860
subscribe to one channel, and let Ponsho do the rest.

415
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,860
I click on a new channel, technology channel, entertainment,

416
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,860
and I get my shows.

417
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,860
Yeah.

418
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,860
You're missing the point.

419
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,860
I don't have to figure out what I want.

420
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,860
If I even click on DSC, it tells me of people who also click,

421
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,860
you know, subscribe to Twitch and Dignation, and others.

422
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
Yeah.

423
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
But how limiting is that?

424
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,860
Because that's exactly what you're going to get from those types of recommendations.

425
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,860
And for those types of recommendation engines,

426
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,860
what you want to see is who else has DSC in their channel?

427
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,860
And then you want to go look at their channels.

428
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,860
It's like the old Napster.

429
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,860
And by the way, that was pretty freaking awesome.

430
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
Well, I have a channel.

431
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,860
I don't need a sub channel.

432
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,860
So you're being particle-ed by the geek.

433
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,860
Say, develop the bell and whistle.

434
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,860
You rush it out.

435
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
Come on.

436
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,860
And again, this is not a bell and whistle.

437
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,860
This has been there from day one.

438
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,860
Oh, then take it.

439
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,860
Here's where I think you need to focus.

440
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
You're finally some advice.

441
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,860
Need to say, our goal is to get one million unique listeners

442
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,860
per show for all top productions.

443
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,860
Well, one million depends on how you count it.

444
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,860
But on a daily basis, we're doing well more than a million in audience

445
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,860
across the board.

446
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,860
So we might want to set our heights a little higher than you're recommending.

447
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,860
And if something doesn't lead you in that direction,

448
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
don't do it.

449
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,860
So stop being a technology like company and become a listener like company.

450
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,860
And the other reason why I know the geek's around the show

451
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,860
and you don't have a heavy, heavy marketing person,

452
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,860
you'll say, don't I miss a city out there looking for a job?

453
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,860
Do you have a company hire him?

454
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Oh, dude.

455
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,860
Dude, what are you taking me for, Nylon?

456
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,860
Just what do you take me for?

457
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,860
Do you not think that I didn't reach out immediately day one?

458
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,860
And what do you think my meetings in New York were about?

459
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,860
Dork?

460
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,860
That gets you to pass the amount of unique listeners.

461
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,860
By the way, I'm just not sitting around waiting for a job, okay?

462
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,860
Not true.

463
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,860
It is not that simple.

464
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,860
Or not as simple as your thought process.

465
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,860
Don't hire a print journalist with no track record of innovation.

466
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

467
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,860
Who by the way said, shoot Apple stock, which I'm,

468
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,860
wouldn't have been a good idea this week?

469
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,860
Well, now this tells me that you're obviously not a financial analyst.

470
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,860
You didn't even, you didn't even take the time to look at the Apple stock.

471
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,860
Yeah, sure it opened up a little bit on Friday.

472
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,860
And it closed down pretty much where it opened, you know?

473
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,860
And by the way, you should know.

474
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,860
You sell on the news and buy on the rumor.

475
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,860
To revolutionize your content.

476
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,860
So, I don't need channels, you know, who needs it?

477
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,860
Yeah.

478
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,860
Give me compelling content.

479
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,860
High quality and things you'll listen to.

480
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,860
And don't give me podcasting features that only 8,000 podcasts will do it about.

481
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,860
And to hell, funny enough.

482
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,860
You're such a dick!

483
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,860
Whoa!

484
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,860
He's an island.

485
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,860
I'll spark an expatriate.

486
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,860
He's in London, but he's from New York.

487
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,860
Whoa!

488
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,860
He's an island.

489
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,860
Can't you pursue an island?

490
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,860
He's in London, but he's from New York.

491
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,860
Today is an island segment brought to you by Coca-Cola.

492
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,860
This summer, when you buy Coke, you get music.

493
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,860
You can win an iPod or free songs on iTunes.

494
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Might as well get something out of the bastard, eh?

495
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,860
We'll just sponsor him.

496
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,860
Ah, yes.

497
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,860
I still waiting for some responses, by the way.

498
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,860
Has anyone used that code in the UK?

499
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,860
Have you entered your code?

500
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,860
To see if you can win an iPod or free songs, please.

501
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,860
Let me know.

502
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,860
Call it into the voice mail line.

503
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,860
If you're in the UK, here's a handy reminder for the number to call.

504
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,860
If you're going to call it and tell me if you won't free tunes on iTunes.

505
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,860
Or an iPod.

506
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:19,860
Plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 16, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3, plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.

507
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,860
Looks like I picked a wrong week, please.

508
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,860
Yeah.

509
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,860
Today is Monday, July 2, 2007.

510
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,860
A date that I will forever remember.

511
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,860
Last year, in fact, the second fell on a Sunday.

512
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,860
I remember it very well because this is the day one year ago today that my mother passed away

513
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,860
of lung cancer.

514
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,860
After a pretty fucked up ride, I have to say.

515
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:49,860
Luckily, all of her children were there.

516
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,860
Well, if you just go back in time about a year and listen to this.

517
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,860
Actually, if you listen to the podcast from a year ago, you'll hear how I felt about it.

518
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,860
Everyone was so incredibly nice.

519
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,860
Friend and foe, I would have to say.

520
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,860
And today, again, no different.

521
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:17,860
People are sending me messages of support, text messages, emails.

522
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
Very, very nice.

523
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,860
Everyone remembers my mom with her butterfly hang up.

524
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,860
And everyone's sending nice little messages about butterflies.

525
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,860
So I really, really do appreciate it.

526
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:35,860
And of course, I want to play a song that will remind me of my mom.

527
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,860
I think I played this a year ago, so it's pretty much going to be one of those tunes that

528
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:55,860
is a part of the soundtrack of my life.

529
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,860
I've been down.

530
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,860
I've been out.

531
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,860
And I've felt like my lives came in.

532
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:13,860
And I can't seem to find your lives about.

533
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:21,860
And I've lost my direction again.

534
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:27,860
And I'm feeling lonely at the end of the day.

535
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,860
I know that my son is phone call the way.

536
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,860
Because it's you.

537
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

538
00:26:39,860 --> 00:27:09,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

539
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:39,860
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

540
00:27:39,860 --> 00:28:09,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

541
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:39,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

542
00:28:39,860 --> 00:29:00,840
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

543
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:07,360
I'm feeling like I can't say again more

544
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,840
There's to remind me what I'm playing for

545
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,720
I'm feeling like I can't say again more

546
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,040
There's to remind me what I'm playing for

547
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:30,040
I'm feeling like I can't say again more

548
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:39,040
There's to remind me what I'm playing for

549
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,040
I'm feeling like I can't say again more

550
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:52,040
There's to remind me what I'm playing for

551
00:29:52,040 --> 00:30:14,040
I'm feeling like I can't say again more

552
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:19,040
There's to remind me what I'm playing for

553
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:26,040
I don't feel like doing any more show today

554
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
