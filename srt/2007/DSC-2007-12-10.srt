00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
After a nice relaxing weekend, you need the DSC 698 to make you start thinking again.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here's Adam with today's topics.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
All in a brighter note commercial break.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The government has now banned the carrying of spheres.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Stop about every thousand miles and ask too much is it?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You might wish to stay on and listen.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It was a place where everything was legal.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I meant this woman.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So if you're looking for emotional satisfaction,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
my advice to you is seek professional help.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
For $16 billion worth of airplane strapped by us.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In the next generation where you can't anymore.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your name is Steve.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I like to think of science.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you're not going to do it,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll be asking if you can do it.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't agree.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Television.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The drug of a nation.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Rating ignorance.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
A feeding radiation on television.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The drug of a nation.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Reading ignorance.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A feeding radiation TV.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's satellite links by United States of Unconsciousness.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
A prosthetic therapeutic and extremely addictive.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The methadone metronome.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Pumping out 150 channels 24 hours a day.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can flip through all of them.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And still there's nothing worth watching.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
TV.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's a reason why less than 10% of our nation reads books daily.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
By most people think central America means Kansas.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Socialism means on American.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And apartheid is a new headache remedy.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Absorbed in this world is so hard to find us.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It shapes our minds the most.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Maybe the mother of our nation should remind us.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That was sitting too close to the television.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The drug of a nation.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Reading ignorance.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A feeding radiation on television.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The drug of a nation.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Reading ignorance.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
A feeding radiation TV.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's a stomping round of political candidates.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We're bears in the woods.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I chased by Christian form of the particles.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
TV.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's mechanized politics remote control over the masses.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Co-sponsored by environment-only safe gases.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Watch for the PBS special.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a perpetuation of the two-party system.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Where image takes precedence over wisdom.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Where sound by politics.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I serve to the fast food culture.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Where state keeps in your mouth a more important.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There's no words to come out of it.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Race-baming is the way to get selected.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Really hard and no willy not get elected on television.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The drug of a nation.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Reading ignorance.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
A feeding radiation on television.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The drug of a nation.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Reading ignorance.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A feeding radiation.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
On the street isn't a threat.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We can be a new tag off in your world.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's a bluff.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Got the idea.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All right.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's go.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
TV.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is a reflector for the director.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Does it imitate us?

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do we imitate it?

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Because a child watches 1,500 murders before he's 12 years old.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And then we wonder why we created adjacent generation.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That learned to laugh.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Rather than a boy than a boy.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
TV.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The players were armed, chair, generals, and quarterbacks.

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
An experience firsthand.

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The excitement of video warfare.

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's a theme song.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's sung in the background.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Sugar sweet sitcoms.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I leave us with a bad act to taste.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
While pop stars.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And met a more precise and consoled pop stars.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You saw the video.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You heard the soundtrack.

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Well now go by the soft drink.

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well the only color that I support.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But yeah.

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You and T.O.L.A.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Costs of living a lion.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's all television.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The drug of imagination.

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Breathing ignorance.

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The feeding radiation.

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
All television.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The drug of imagination.

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Breathing ignorance.

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The feeding radiation.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Back again.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You and him.

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Turn to our irregularly program schedule.

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hidden cleverly between heavy-breasted beer and car commercials.

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
CNN, ESPN, ABC, BC, B, C, B, P, N, T.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But mostly BS.

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We're oxymoronic language.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Like virtually spotless.

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Fresh frozen.

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Like yet filling.

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And military intelligence.

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I become standard.

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
TV is a place where phrases are redefined.

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Like recessions and necessary downturn.

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Crewed oil on a beach to moose.

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
civilian death to collateral damages.

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And being killed by your own army.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's not a cause.

125
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Friendly fire.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
TV is a place.

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Well the pursuit of happiness has become the pursuit of trivia.

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Where two-paced and cars have become sex objects.

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Where imagination is sucked out of children.

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Fire cap, old rainfall.

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
TV is the only wet nurse that would create a cripple.

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Television.

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The drug of imagination.

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Breathing ignorance.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
feeding radiation.

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Television.

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The drug of imagination.

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Breathing ignorance.

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The feeding radiation.

140
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Television.

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The drug of imagination.

142
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Breathing ignorance.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Breathing radiation on television.

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The drug of imagination.

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Breathing ignorance.

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Breathing radiation.

147
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What do you say Charlie has?

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You got your ears on listening to the lyrics.

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Television.

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The drug of imagination.

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Impossible heroes of hip hoppercy.

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
On the chak chak.

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, got the idea, the people in America can do it.

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Go ahead or let it be, you're telling me.

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The people in America can do it.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay, got the idea, all right now that's kind of it.

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How about that for some red pill?

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We source code number 690.

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What are we?

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
690 eight coming to you from the curry manner on the west side of G-town in the affluent suburb of

162
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Surrey known as Guilford.

163
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It hasn't been very nice this weekend.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I got home Saturday morning for my San Francisco John's two weeks on the oil rig.

165
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And I came home to high winds and at a high home.

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It was wet, it's just been totally crappy.

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's okay because tomorrow I'm leaving on a jet plane once again off to New York,

168
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
which I here is even crappier.

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's a really, really cold and chances of more snowstorm.

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So it should be interesting.

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah, it seems like the past week talking about consumerism,

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
talking about perceived obsolescence and planned obsolescence.

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And lots of stuff is thrown some red pill juice out into the ether.

174
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I should say, and we'll get to that in just a sec.

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I have to say, I wasn't really getting into the new sign-off thing.

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was kind of like it and say, and fuck you, Adam Curry.

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But after hearing the Hanukkah song on today's day, the source code,

178
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I have to say, man, I love you, Adam Curry.

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's a awesome song.

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Anyway, keep up good work.

181
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, I'm amazed you hadn't heard that.

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's, of course, it was the new version part two of the Hanukkah song.

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Adam Sandler played that on Thursday.

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So we're going to do some of the food bar bits today on today's Monday show,

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
which, of course, is emanating from the attic.

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's so nice to be back with my, with my setup.

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You know, where I got all the sound that I want, and I could...

189
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I can boost up my headphones as loud as I want.

190
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And oh, yeah, it's just...

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I wish I could travel with this whole kit with me.

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm looking into some more gear.

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I think this persona's stuff.

194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I need, like, a Mike preamp and more compression.

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The can never be too much compression.

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Anyway, so we can't put some interesting things last week talking about the wrong brand.

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If you look at today's album, aren't you seeing nice stab at that already?

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And the wrong brand would be a consumer attempt, a rebellious attempt,

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
at slowing down consumerism out of protest.

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Of course, we need a message to go along with this, which is basically, hey, hey, stop trying to control us,

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
because look, you can't...

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Which means that you got to turn off your television.

203
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I mean, you cannot be programmed by the man to go and shop as much as you wanted to.

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But, of course, you know, I'm just like getting into this myself.

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So it's not like there's no call to action yet, no call to arms as of just yet.

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't think we'll be on time for the Christmas season,

207
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
but maybe we should even wait until after the holidays,

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
just to see what we did collectively as consumers.

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I think we'll probably get close to, I don't know,

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
a billion dollars in shopping at least, maybe even more.

211
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh, there's been so much to think about.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hey, Adam, it's Kevin Crossman, the Pratt Scruncher from PrattPackPotCast.com.

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You know, my head really, really hurts from the mindset you gave on the last DSE.

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's totally fucking shit.

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Easy there.

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
All that consumer stuff.

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I mean, speak about consumerism here in the holidays.

218
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Jesus, age, Christ.

219
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have got a new perspective.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And I appreciate the, you know, the fact that the DSE is not just a little,

221
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
you know, promotional vehicle for Pratt Show.

222
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, I hope it's that as well, obviously.

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And, you know, some of your favorite mashups.

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
All right, that's stuff too.

225
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And, and a way to solicit naked pictures.

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, okay, it's that too.

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah, I do like the social agenda that has been put out.

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
With regards to Zack's invitation, you heard a little conversation with a man and a woman in there.

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah.

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That was a cut-up clip from the movie Knocked Up.

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, it's just courses of the favorite of ours.

232
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay.

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Anyway, like once again, I guess thanks for the mind fuck.

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And thank you very much, Adam Curry.

235
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Sure.

236
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Not a problem.

237
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And a lot of people send similar messages in saying,

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Wow, I never really thought about it that way.

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I never thought that we have so much power as consumers

240
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
that we should actually learn to wield that power.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
If we can just break free of the hypnotic forces at work,

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
which may finally come from television.

243
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Because make no mistake.

244
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
When you're sitting there, you think you're relaxing in front of the tube.

245
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
No way, man.

246
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's like a filling station.

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's like a gas pump for consumers

248
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and to be to flow into your brains.

249
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And they do it in really nasty ways.

250
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Like you ain't going to get laid if you don't buy this product.

251
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Or you might die if you don't buy this product.

252
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's basically those two.

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But it's all based on fear.

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And people are waking up to it.

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hey, Adam.

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This is old in from California.

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hey, man.

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Just look at it into DSD-697.

259
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And I got to tell you that you're wrong,

260
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
brand.

261
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's a little late.

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
My wife cornered the market on years ago.

263
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Every time I put on a shirt, that's the wrong thing.

264
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Every time I wear a pair of pants, it's the wrong thing.

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So, you know, she hasn't trademarked it yet,

266
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
but she'd be really disappointed if you grabbed the brand.

267
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Just kidding.

268
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Look at Adam.

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, man.

270
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No, I think my wife has part of her corner of the market

271
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
nail there as well on the,

272
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
no, that's the wrong thing, honey.

273
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And this is catching on.

274
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
People really do get it.

275
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And it's fighting fire with fire, you know?

276
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's like, let's slow down consumerists

277
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
by introducing a new product.

278
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's the product that will only change.

279
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We could make a change once a year,

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
once a year instead of four times a year

281
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
for all four fashion seasons.

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
By the way, I'm not just picking on the fashion industry.

283
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
This is across the board.

284
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This obviously has to do with consumer electronics,

285
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
with automobiles, with homes, with you name it,

286
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
with vacations.

287
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I mean, all of this stuff is a part of the drive

288
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
to make the American consumer consume.

289
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And I did receive also a lot of emails from people saying

290
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
that this was that after 9, 11, George Bush said,

291
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
please go shopping.

292
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And I've been trying to corroborate that fact.

293
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And although he does say something about,

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and all the speeches I could find,

295
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
he talks about keeping the great American economy rolling.

296
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's not quite the same as go shopping.

297
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So unless I'm mistaken, I don't think he actually said that.

298
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But he did say that just recently in,

299
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I think it was a rose garden press conference.

300
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
In fact, you want me to look that up for a second

301
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
because I should have prepared for that hold on.

302
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Let's do a Google search.

303
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Bush, go shopping.

304
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Let's just see.

305
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let's see if we can get some actual video of that.

306
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I love Google.

307
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So efficient.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Here we go.

309
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Dig video.

310
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay.

311
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
With recession looming, Bush tells America to go shopping.

312
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So this is the second link on Google.

313
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And it's from a, from dig.com.

314
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So it's only 17 digs and still number two on Google.

315
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's interesting.

316
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Here we go.

317
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Once listen what the press had to say.

318
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Now this was,

319
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
um,

320
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
doesn't say.

321
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh yeah.

322
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Actually, I've seen this at the page that,

323
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
so there was an article in the Harold Tribune

324
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
on, um,

325
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
January 14, 2003 Bush did nothing to mobilize public opinion

326
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
to accept the sacrifices that war implies.

327
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The first thing a leader would do.

328
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Tax cuts could go ahead as planned.

329
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Energy saving was dismissed out of hand.

330
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Go shopping was the administration's message.

331
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But see,

332
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't actually think he said that.

333
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Here's what he said in 2003.

334
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
As we work with Congress in the coming year to chart a new course

335
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
in Iraq and strengthen a military to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

336
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Hmm.

337
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
We must also work together to achieve important goals for the American people here at home.

338
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
This work begins with keeping our economy growing.

339
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And I encourage you all to go shopping more.

340
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah.

341
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But that's,

342
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
that's the new one.

343
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't think he said that in 2003.

344
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Let's listen to see.

345
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And work with Congress in the coming year.

346
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah.

347
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
See, that's, uh, this is from, uh,

348
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
just this path month I believe.

349
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Challenges is the 21st century.

350
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
We must also work together to achieve important goals.

351
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And listen to how he says it too.

352
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Smug little twat.

353
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
This work begins with keeping our economy growing.

354
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And I encourage you all to go shopping more.

355
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
All right.

356
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So the message really is true, though.

357
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We have to keep the economy growing.

358
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So that's just the proof that we actually do have this power.

359
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And if we slow everything down,

360
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
well, actually, I'd like to hear some economists weigh in on this.

361
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If we stop shopping, if we keep the money in our pockets,

362
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
what happens to the value of the dollar?

363
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Do we, uh,

364
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
hmm, it's got to hurt somebody.

365
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's for sure.

366
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But will it hurt us?

367
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I think not.

368
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I think it'll just save us money.

369
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And, uh, we can start making demands.

370
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Think about it.

371
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No, no.

372
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't think we're going to shop.

373
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I think we'll just keep our money in our pockets.

374
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Thank you very much.

375
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, unless, uh, let's say you bring all of our troops home from Iraq right now.

376
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah.

377
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You know what?

378
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Okay, don't.

379
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Don't go ahead.

380
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Fine.

381
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We won't watch television.

382
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We won't shop.

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We have plenty of other ways to entertain ourselves.

384
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
We've got webcams.

385
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We've got astroglyde.

386
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, yeah.

387
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Adam Jason from San Diego.

388
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Two things.

389
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Well, you know, I always start off with that.

390
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Scatch that.

391
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You know, uh, you're cracking me up with your speech on, uh,

392
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
perceived, uh, obsolescence or whatever it is about.

393
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't get caught into buying the latest from the greatest.

394
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Uh, Mr. How many MacBooks have you gone through?

395
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And are all of them still working?

396
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Did all of them need to be replaced?

397
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Mr. Brand new iPhone?

398
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Mr. Brandnew?

399
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
N-810?

400
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Mr. Brandnew?

401
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This brand with that?

402
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
New car?

403
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
How many new cars have you gotten?

404
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Uh, new plane?

405
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And, uh, wanting to buy another new plane?

406
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Please.

407
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
A little plane?

408
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Maybe you're not getting this from TV.

409
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And TV isn't telling you to go buy a new plane or new.

410
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't know what else I'm not telling you, but whatever it is.

411
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Point one finger at others.

412
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Four point right back at you.

413
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Ah.

414
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's really tires me.

415
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I've got a lot of these messages too.

416
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm not saying that, first, I'm not telling you to do anything.

417
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm not saying that I'm not just his guilty,

418
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
or that I'm not a, I'm a great consumer.

419
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I really help the economy. Are you kidding me?

420
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Absolutely.

421
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But we're just having a discussion here.

422
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay. This is so typical of the internet.

423
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Like me?

424
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
He said this.

425
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah.

426
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So off to unproductive.

427
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah.

428
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's like all these flames that go back and forth and forearms.

429
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Why?

430
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's painful, painful.

431
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We're having a little discussion here.

432
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Don't judge anyone yet.

433
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm not judging you.

434
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm just talking.

435
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a discussion.

436
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I make me crazy with that shit.

437
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Listen to what I'm saying.

438
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Okay.

439
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm not telling you.

440
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm not holding you then, though.

441
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And of course, I'll participate.

442
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm happy to participate.

443
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
My two girls aren't quite that happy.

444
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Come home after two weeks in San Francisco.

445
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And I'm talking about no more shopping.

446
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm talking about clothes with the wrong brand.

447
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And they're looking at me like, who the fuck is this guy?

448
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What'd you do with our husband slash dad?

449
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Could you please bring him back?

450
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah.

451
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I was just listening to what was at 697.

452
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And I love that thing you're playing from that website story.

453
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That was really cool.

454
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I was totally digging that.

455
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Really, that's pretty much all my brain has been thinking about lately.

456
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Glad you played that.

457
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It really gets all of our mind going.

458
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Red pills.

459
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But you should check out the movie What would Jesus buy?

460
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't think you mentioned it on the show yet.

461
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But it's produced by the same guy that did it.

462
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Super size me.

463
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I haven't had a chance to check an out either yet.

464
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I got to find where it's shown in my area.

465
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But yeah, so check that out.

466
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Check out the trailer.

467
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It looks like it's pretty promising.

468
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I love you.

469
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I don't care.

470
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Thank you.

471
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Well, I did a little bit of homework for today's program.

472
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And I found the trailer at apple.com.

473
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It has a lot of.

474
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
A lot of words on the screen, which are factoids about how much money is being spent on shopping, etc.

475
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So in order to fully enjoy this multimedia experience,

476
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I shall read what is written on the screen while you listen to the audio of the trailer.

477
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What would Jesus buy?

478
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Which is a movie I've not seen yet.

479
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But boy, do I want to?

480
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Here we go.

481
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
From producer Morgan Spurlock.

482
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
There I'm so sorry to hear I have sinned.

483
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Lots of Christmas pictures here.

484
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Cash register, ringing up big bucks.

485
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Last year, American spent 455 billion during the holidays.

486
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
With some brand new rims, you know, I just want to cruise around,

487
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
flossing my rims.

488
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Consumer credit debt is now 2.4 trillion.

489
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yes.

490
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We'll have about happen.

491
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Because you and mommy they were doing.

492
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
This is a kid's room.

493
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
This has nothing in it.

494
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Filled with boxes.

495
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
26 American million Americans are addicted to shopping.

496
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Women who is about 60 years old,

497
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
cuss me out and spit on me for not having a PS3 for her.

498
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Six year old grandson.

499
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Who will save Christmas?

500
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Reverend Billy Smith.

501
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Reverend Billy, you call it the chocolate.

502
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's a chocolate shop.

503
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Chocolate.

504
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Chocolate shopping.

505
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Drive the demons out of those cash register.

506
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The church has stopped shopping around a cross country mission to save us

507
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
from our shopping since this holiday season.

508
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Come on for the power to stop shopping.

509
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Hey, baby.

510
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Hey, who's brought out for drinking over our lives?

511
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Ah, they're in the mall.

512
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Time to exercise.

513
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Let's go to that Walmart sign now.

514
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Let's take a view, Billy, into our bodies.

515
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Hey, lady.

516
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's taking the through an exercise amount of Walmart sign.

517
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Main street here, USA.

518
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's made in China.

519
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What?

520
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You got that on them with different things.

521
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What would Jesus buy?

522
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This Christmas.

523
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Well, that's something we all got to go and see.

524
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That looks awesome.

525
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Of course, it won't actually launch until after the 25th.

526
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm sure.

527
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm sure no studio as a part of the big machine would actually allow that movie to be

528
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
out in theaters while shopping was still taking place.

529
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm proudly casting with Adam Curry.

530
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Hey, Adam.

531
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Who are you?

532
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Ready to be stumped?

533
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Good.

534
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
He used them.

535
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Left over from the toolbar with young pullback.

536
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Hey, Adam.

537
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This is hit this number 99.

538
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000

620
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560

00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,320
It has number 101

623
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:50,680
I can't help but I just got a laugh every single time I hear all the the imaging and staging and the voiceovers and the in your face attitude of young pull out in the hittest

624
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,240
number 98

625
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,560
Vacationing in the Canary Islands. I've got to check and make sure to see we're we're not paying young too much

626
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,880
All right man. I'm looking forward to it. I can't wait to hear what you got lined up for us on the hittest number 100

627
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,520
Most awesome. Hey, you're something couple of people emailed me story came out. I guess last night or today

628
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,240
This is a prolific program or sent me this link

629
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:22,600
Major crude producer Iran has completely stopped carrying out its oil transactions in dollars oil minister

630
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,200
Golem Hussein Nossari sit on Saturday labeling the greenback as an unreliable currency

631
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,440
At the moment selling oil in dollars has been completely halted in line with the policy of selling crude in non-dollar currencies

632
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,760
Nossari was quoted as saying by the ISNA news agency

633
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,600
I don't know what ISNA is is that a rocky news agency

634
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,600
That's a doubt Jones a news wire report. So I would say they probably check that out

635
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,800
He added the dollar is an unreliable currency considering it's devaluation in the oil exporters losses. Okay, so this is

636
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,160
I'd say concerning and

637
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,040
Do you think it has anything to do with the fact that they were no weapons of mass destruction production facilities found and

638
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,760
Instead of saying hey cool guys. Thanks for complying

639
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:14,200
We said oh, you know what you're still dangerous. Do you think I'd had anything to do with it? What's so ever do you think maybe?

640
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:23,640
All right, you know that that could be a big problem, but there's other smaller problems in the world which to some

641
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,200
See just as big if not larger. Hi, this is Ron from the zip 71101 podcast

642
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,640
Imagine returning home after an evening out with your family only to find that your home had burned to the ground

643
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Nothing left but memories

644
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,120
This happened recently to fellow podcaster Carmen Tyler sister Diane and her two daughters

645
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,880
Now I've never been in that situation and I can't even begin to imagine how they must have felt

646
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,280

653
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,280
Preparing for the show that really sucks. I remember his little boy when we lived in Maryland

654
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,040
I was five or six years old a house around the corner burned down. I remember

655
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,280
You'd see a whole bunch of people stand and like really really burned down

656
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,520
You know where you could just see you know pieces of the structure still standing and just a huge smoloring mass of

657
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,080
Stuff and I remember how sad that felt

658
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
You know it's like wow man you know and was hurt

659
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:00,360
But all your stuff has gone and just everything your life is contained in this box and it's gone and that is

660
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,920
Really really messed up particularly this time of year when it's supposed to be a

661
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
a time of joy and family and

662
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,200
So yeah, please do I'll put a link in the show notes so you can help out to

663
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Carment Tyler sister's family

664
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,640
I'm very sorry to hear that

665
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,600
Where you were talking about how you wanted to find a book on

666
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:35,800
On Dwight Eisenhower and life and all that well I just have to be in my local borders bookstores today and on the new nonfiction shelf

667
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,720
Is they book called Ike and American Hero by

668
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:46,280
Michael Corda K-O-R-D-A and it's a book on the life of Dwight Eisenhower

669
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,720
So I'm sure it's on Amazon. It's want to look it up. So I just wanted to give you a heads up on that and

670
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,800
I love you Adam and don't forget about I love you Adam Curry dot top later

671
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,800
Yeah

672
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Before I forget

673
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,720
Yeah, it should be this week that the codes are coming in for the N-810

674
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,200
A lot of people

675
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,680
Waiting to buy it pent up demand and

676
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:20,680
It's funny because I wonder if this next story has anything to do with the delay in in these codes getting in and yes

677
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,320
It is you know for many countries worldwide

678
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
Including the United Kingdom

679
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:34,360
This came in three days ago 15,000 people at Nokia in Finland helps in Helsinki

680
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,440
became ill after drinking polluted water

681
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,240
The problem is I'm actually translating from a Dutch article into English on the fly here

682
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,880
but somehow the

683
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
the sewage

684
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
plant

685
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,640
somehow connected to the

686
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,640
to the waterworks facility

687
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,640
So basically shit was in the water

688
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,840
and they didn't discover it until after two days that you know that the basically they were

689
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,000
We're slushing all of this crud into the drinking water

690
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,000
And so a lot of people got really sick

691
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,640
And in fact Nokia has not had tap water for a week

692
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,760
and again this was three days ago and the army actually

693
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:29,000
has been called into to bring drinking water and I'm I'm wondering if if Candyman Luke is okay

694
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,120
or he certainly can tell us the ins and outs of the story and maybe he emailed me about it

695
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,560
And I didn't see it or didn't understand it and you know just thinking back I'm thinking did he was he like making

696
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,640
you know side mentions to being not feeling well or being sick and and now I'm kind of concerned

697
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,360
All of our friends and health sink you become definitely ill from poop in the water

698
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,600
Please Candyman let us know that you're okay and that all of our friends are on track there because you know

699
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
We need the codes

700
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,640
I'm curry Nick Jackson from the Bay Area here. I know I have called you

701
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
probably four times

702
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,320
This one you're really gonna like so I was clippin through

703
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:17,240
Through all the recorded shows I have on my TV and then then I saw my mom had an episode of do you record it and guess who is on it?

704
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Dr. Ron Paul on the view

705
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,480
Okay, very very excited to see that. I think I think that really that's really saying something

706
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,560
That he's on you know

707
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:33,240
You of course you get him for five minutes on fox news every once in a while and then since he gets off

708
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,840
and all the all those morons start bashing and stuff and

709
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,880
Because it really sucks box news that they're all morons and we'll give him a fair time

710
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,880
Well, they'll give anyone air to

711
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,760
Saying something that that he's on this this big show that everybody watches the view

712
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,080
Everybody but a lot of people

713
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,440
Yeah

714
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,280
Oh, I don't know that's that's definitely good

715
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,720
That's definitely good and I know that lots of people are working these shows too. There's something called Ron Paul swarm

716
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,880
And it's a it's a site that you subscribe to and it gives you

717
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,800
Media outlets to contact when Ron Paul is gonna be in the area to try and get him on the show now this stuff is really working

718
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,360
It's not the mistake. It's I think it's by design and he's got traction for sure

719
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,280
I wish I had seen him on the view. I'm sure there's a YouTube link somewhere

720
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,320
You continue and I'll look for the link unfortunately though because you know the the panel's host

721
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,000
They're all they talk so much so so much so you couldn't really you could hardly get a word

722
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,920
And it wasn't like the way that see that that really showed me the the power of the interview

723
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:40,760
You with him where it was just here the questions give me the answers and that was it, but you know

724
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,760
They have to be occur in our units

725
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:48,360
But so he didn't get stress himself as well as he could have if they'd given him a chance to speak

726
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:53,480
But I think you know, he kept just bringing up the constitution constitution constitution

727
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
That's all the news friends with countries

728
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,360
Let's not be not the enemies. It was not the allies just let's just be friends with them

729
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
And so I hopefully hopefully some people

730
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,160
You're on a big hurrying up to actually here and if you can and I'll find them on YouTube or something

731
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
It was it was an interesting interview to see

732
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,480
One of the discussion a row of the way to um as you can

733
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,440
But yeah

734
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,640
non-Paul

735
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,680
Awesome. Yep. Don't forget December 16th is

736
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,320
The Boston Tea Party Tea Party 07 want to drop in on the money bar on Ron Paul

737
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040

738
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,840
Ron Paul 2008 dot com donate your money to the campaign on that day. I think I found the yeah the piece from the view

739
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,240
Let's just take a look see if this is it and I put a link to it in the show now

740
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,240
It's a daily source code dot com

741
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,760
On the view on Thursday and joy you have something to say

742
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,880
Good night. I wasn't on the show. Let me move ahead. Oh, there he is. I did. We have a show. Oh

743
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,960
Okay

744
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,640
Well, I'm already three minutes into it and there's still them talking

745
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,240
Okay, I'll put a link to that in the show notes no time forced to go through it now

746
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:27,800
I'm using amazing characters. I just want to thank you for talking about them and that's about it

747
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Love you Adam. No, I'm off

748
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,680
No, I'm on my friend

749
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,440
You know

750
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,840
This uh the idea of stop shopping that's something Ron Paul could actually use I think I I don't know if it would

751
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,160
If it would make any sense for the primaries, but wow if I

752
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Excuse me

753
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
Let me have a sip of tea here

754
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,600
Still the PG tips haven't picked up the Yorkshire at the office

755
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,960
May love bringing home with me tonight. We have our London office Christmas party this evening till that should be fun

756
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,160
Yeah, I wasn't gonna say I don't know what the hell I was I was gonna say you know if only I'd known about the sooner

757
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:16,680
I could have started before Christmas or just not gonna make it the 455 billion dollars

758
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,080
Americans will spend on during Christmas. Is that really true is that really the number?

759
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,320
We're not rages amount. I'm sure we could do with a hundred billion less

760
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,560
much of thank

761
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,360
200 billion less we all could cut down just a little bit

762
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:37,160
But you know I've romp all uh it's on the Republican ticket if he wins the primaries and and he's the guy boy

763
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,200
He could he could use this as a part of the platform. Hey, let's just stop everything show Congress

764
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,080
Show Congress we need business. Let's just stop shopping screw you you know watch all the

765
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,840
All the lobbyists lining up trying to fix that that that would be a problem that that would slaughter wall street

766
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,120
Oh, man, it would be so much fun

767
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,320
Boy, I'm just a call from Salt Lake City. I was just listening to DSC

768
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,960
696 and boy the caller that called into uh I guess

769
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,640
convince you of the fallie of supporting on Paul is just

770
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,080
I don't even know what word to use for that guy socialist communist. I guess

771
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,960
blaming liberal maybe

772
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:29,080
To suggest that Ron Paul's ideas or platform which as you stay correctly is the Constitution of the United States

773
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:37,320
Which is the only platform Amy president so candidate should be running on considering that's the only oath they take when they get sworn into office right on

774
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
to suggest that that is somehow

775
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:47,640
Not the solution of the entire world as if it's the job of the president of the United States and I have to point out here that

776
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,600
I'm noticing more and more that people actually

777
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,800
Do kind of like the idea of a one-world government you know United nations

778
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
NATO

779
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,080
World trade organization, you know

780
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,920
I don't know if you'd lump that one in but you went for sure

781
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,000
You know

782
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,680
But that's just that's just places where people get together negotiate shit

783
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Excuse me

784
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,040
That does remind me that if you want a fantastic deal on a domain name go to

785
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,600
DailySourceco.com is a link there to my go daddy codes page and

786
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,760
I want you to use a DSC one two or three the

787
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,480
Offers are right there so you can see which one is gonna work best for you

788
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,800
But if you just want a domain name for six ninety five it's DSC three is the code you use upon checkout

789
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,680
And I've been buying a couple of domains lately and I'm using my own code of course, and it's great. I love getting that discount myself

790
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Let's see. Oh, let's get back to

791
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,600
So yeah, you know, I think that there's a two-step process there

792
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,400
You know in order to understand what Ron Paul is saying and and to become passionate

793
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
About what someone call

794
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,000
Isolationism, you know, you've got to understand the Constitution you've just a small document

795
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,520
You can go read it online. It's it's available almost everywhere in stores and theaters near you

796
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,720
And

797
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,760
When they make that a great movie about the Constitution how it came about

798
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,720
Yeah, that's another period piece I'd like to produce

799
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Um

800
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,680
Yeah, so I think you need to evaluate it. That's what you really want people don't get kind of getting

801
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,680
Blue pill mode, you know, it's like, yeah, just take care of me. Well, yeah, everywhere

802
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:41,640
Government you all take care of it. Get along together and just make sure that I got a job and I can take a vacation and just have kind of an okay life

803
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,600
Just in a nice warm bed of productivity for the man

804
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,440
The problem solver for the entire world is absolutely ridiculous

805
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,160
I don't know, I guess this guy

806
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,720
He really should just move. He really should be living and maybe, you know, communist China

807
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
Yeah, okay, all right

808
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,920
Everyone has a different opinion dude, and that's okay. Don't go tell them people that go to go move to China

809
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,720
China might be great. I don't know. I don't know if China's horrible

810
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,520
Yeah, some parts of it probably are

811
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,760
But then again, some parts of the United States are horrible, so some parts of the United Kingdom are horrible

812
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
You know

813
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,480
All right, and I got to get out of here. Let's do this. Hi, Adam. It's Hermann. You know, she doesn't number one out

814
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,920
And I've got good news for all your listeners. We're busy making some very special toys

815
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,800
Rob good girls and boys around the world

816
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,400
Anything you got to bet this year? Charlie, I'm in the background. It helps us work a little harder

817
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:47,000
Well, such is the life of an elf? Well, I'm very good. Is the Senate on December 16th

818
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,240
It's gonna be live over the five lines that come

819
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,160
We're also excited. We've got all our computers ready to listen and maybe

820
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:03,720
Just maybe we'll be able to download onto a new iPod that's if we can make one

821
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
We don't want to be sued by Apple so

822
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
It may that happen

823
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,120
Well, I hope you and all your listeners can have a Merry Christmas and don't forget to go over at the

824
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,440
Super 16th to the five lines at eight thirty

825
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,080
Eastern time

826
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,360
They're here a special message from Santa Claus

827
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,920
It's a matter of fact, I think I hear Santa coming right now

828
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,480
Then he's been treating you a little bit

829
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
So he makes a little bit stomp

830
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
But I'm sure

831
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Okay

832
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,680
It's Santa here

833
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:52,440
A very Merry Christmas and the happiest New Year

834
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,560
Bye for me

835
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,720
Whatever a gift is I hope someday

836
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,360
You're the greatest

837
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,320
All right, let's revert next time on the promo, okay

838
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Nation's the podcast

839
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:35,160
I'm just been thinking about all of this fuck you I love you all of this confusion at the end of the comments

840
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,360
I think people were kind of digging the fuck you but the negativity it's it's kind of a little much I understand

841
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:46,040
Now though the I love you it's not catching on and it's not catching on everyone saying it is catching on

842
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,240
You know how it goes

843
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:53,240
But anyway, I think that I found a way for people to still say the fuck you and for you to even like it better

844
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,240
Okay, y'all m into that. Yeah, I'm ready. Yeah, I'm ready. Okay

845
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,560
How about I'd like to fuck you Adam Curry?

846
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,840
That caught me off guard. Yeah, I got to thought you might like that. Anyway just a thought

847
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,520
Doesn't catch on. I love you Adam Curry. All right. Send me negative pictures please

848
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,400
Adam ship from top of the pot says I've been listening to the last few shows of

849
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,400
Watch loose changes. I'd guys in the story of stuff and for some reason

850
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,000
It's a awakening appears to be new but I bet you were warm before

851
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,760
I know you remember those Frank Zapper for President bumper stickers that were around when we were back in our early 20s

852
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,720
You know like four or five years ago

853
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,360
Everyone thought this was a joke

854
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,040
But I think he was before his time and a viable option to run our country

855
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:52,120
I know it's not pot safe, but just listen to I and the slime and you know yet all this planned and perceived

856
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,680
Obsolessence bump bigger that a long time ago

857
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,200
PS what is it now? I love the fuck you Adam Curry yo

858
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:35,480
I'm close and I'm ready

859
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:43,720
I'm obsessed and I have a list of what you just have to make me lost change

860
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:52,040
I'm the two war of the government and in the street for I am just in the room

861
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:58,040
And regulate you I need you by a whole man punishes

862
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,240
But you can't look away I need you to think I'm delicious

863
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,600
With the stuff that I say

864
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,000
