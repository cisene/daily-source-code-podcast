00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Hello everybody, welcome to the Daily Source Code episode number 603 coming to you from the

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,440
Curry Manor located in the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Guilford West Side

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,920
a town of course. A little bit later today on publishing the show because I'm on a new

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,480
regime now. Oh yes, I've got a new attitude and a new regime. I went for a lot of exercise

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,480
with the Lady Patricia. Apparently she does this thing every single day, but it consists

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,560
of walking up and down numerous hills and valleys and walking for it seems like miles and

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,320
actually working up a sweat and low and behold, real exercise taking place. And I've got

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,200
a scheduled into the rest of my busy life, but I've got to do it. Why? Well, of course,

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,320
for approximately 21 years Patricia has been nagging at me to start living in a little bit

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,680
healthier life, which includes not smoking. As you know, I'm into notorious self-medicator,

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:03,200
which means, oh, by the way, I quit smoking last night. Anything of the tobacco related family,

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,720
but since I used to self-medicate with tobacco combined with other bits and bobs and just going

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,680
all the other bits and bobs pure. If you know what I'm talking about, I can't function. I'll just

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,800
have to live like a normal person until the end of the day when it's time for, well, you know,

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:28,160
when the sun goes over to the yard arm and we can relax a little bit. So two major changes. Why?

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:36,240
Well, besides Patricia, whispering my ear for years, another angel visited me yesterday and

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,760
and really freaked me out. So we'll talk about that on today's daily source code.

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,600
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,120
In theory, where TV networks, movie studios and record labels, still think they can

20
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,440
govern what you see in here. One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses

21
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,400
and make big media corporations wet their tiny little pants. From Pod Show, home of the world's

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:26,400
most dangerous new content comes the daily source code with Adam Curry.

48
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:04,880
so I promise that he and I in Patricia would have dinner together in his offices in Soho, so that's we went to Sketch,

49
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:13,280
which is it's a cool restaurant, the bathroom's a little weird because you have to go in these eggs, it's kind of like a more cramork capsule,

50
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:21,440
in fact it's exactly like a more for more capsule, Keith of course, the style was late and he had never met Patricia,

51
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,160
I have to say he was blown away by her, in fact I think for two and a half hours I had to listen to him compliment her,

52
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,840
and so near the end of the evening and then we had a great time and you were talking about all kinds of cool stuff,

53
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:43,920
so we're going to be doing with Potchio UK and hey Germany is happening later, we'll talk more about that, just remind me,

54
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:51,920
so he now of course, Super Agent Keith is special because he's a clairvoyant of course,

55
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,360
and he can speak to the afterlife, now you have to understand if you haven't been listening to this show for a while,

56
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:06,400
my wife, the lady Patricia, is a witch, a white witch of course, but she is completely in touch with all the earth elements and stuff,

57
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,040
it's not like it doesn't, you know, pray to week hour or whatever, but she's a witch, she has powers, I'm sure of it,

58
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,920
and I could tell that these two were definitely connecting on that level and Keith reads her poem and he says,

59
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,840
oh look, oh I can see exactly you have a pain between the second and third vertebrae and it's a couple other things,

60
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,800
he said, which is it was exactly spot on and he said, but you're going to live to be a hundred, no problem,

61
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,800
and then he said, oh let me look at your hand at him, and this is the worst thing that can happen to you,

62
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:42,480
we look at your hand and he goes, oh yeah, okay, let's you know, like like the the the card, the black card of death,

63
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,920
pop to the top of the deck, and I was like, no no dude, but read it, now you got to tell me and he's like,

64
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:55,200
well, you have to be careful for diabetes, for high blood pressure, and hold on a second, your grandmother's talking to me,

65
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,240
and he was pretty good at accurately describing it, so I have no reason to believe that he wasn't receiving

66
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,920
some form of signal, he says, you got to stop smoking man, by September 15th or 16th, and you have to stage

67
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:13,840
manager life otherwise you'll be fucked up and your lifeline reflects that. So you can imagine how

68
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,200
I was like dude, we had a great evening and you bummed me out, and so of course,

69
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,840
now I have like two witches on my ass, so I'm like the new things immediately and change it up and

70
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,240
whack it about, and sometimes I can even overdo it if I like to.

71
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:42,800
Hey Adam, how's it going? Hey Adam, how's it going? Yeah, pretty good, I've got to exercise more.

72
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,680
Are you ready for a fun new ass move? Oh, give me some ass moves. Today, we're doing

73
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Cizurkicks line on the floor. Cizurkicks line. So get yourself situated and lay down on your back.

74
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,520
Oh my back, okay. I'm into it now, I need to. Are you ready? No, hold on, yeah.

75
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,080
Okay, now you're laying flat, lift your legs a couple of inches and cross the right over the left.

76
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,880
Then separate them and repeat with the left over the right. You're like should be doing the same

77
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,080
motion as you would if you were making a snowy angel. The arms go under your butt for support

78
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,760
and your head and shoulders lift off the ground a couple of inches. Oh, shit. You do this

79
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,760
continuously for 20 seconds. Okay, I'm doing it count me down baby. Really concentrate on breathing

80
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,360
and squeezing the ab and butt. Okay, and I'm breathing. You should be looking up at the ceiling.

81
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,760
Okay, oh Amy, it's an obstacle. Don't let that back arch. Oh, shit. Okay.

82
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,240
Almost done. Deep breath. And they're walking. And come down. Good job.

83
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,560
Can I get up? I'll see you in a few days and until next time.

84
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,960
And then you should try that one. You, you hold on me and move every mic back to its original position there.

85
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,640
Amy Mack, you know, she does a number of shows and there's a whole new health and fitness

86
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:18,640
channel, which is just about to be, I mean, there's so much good stuff happening. In fact,

87
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:26,800
I saw a press release today. I wonder, hold on a second. I don't get to my docs. There we go.

88
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:35,440
I'm using Google Docs, of course. Let me see if it's saved. Excuse me. This program brought to you

89
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:42,480
in part by time and all p.m. You know, that the NGB show that's sponsored by time and all p.m.

90
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,720
That's really doing quite well. Yeah. Okay, so I'm going to leave the bits out that I can't mention.

91
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:59,280
So name here, the popular columnist author and broadcaster has been named VP Managing Editor

92
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:07,280
of the fill and name channel at pachow.com. I guess that's all I can say right now.

93
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,920
But it's pretty cool. I'm excited about him starting. They've press releases get approved.

94
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,960
Hey, this is really nice for for our little industry here. Comscore, which is a well-respected measurement

95
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,480
system. And I guess they do more than just, what does Comscore do? Comscore, they track visits and

96
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,840
unique, but they've done some study work here on on podcasting. And let's see, Comscore

97
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,920
study reveals that males between the ages of 18 to 24 are more likely to download podcast via

98
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,080
iTunes. I'm not sure what good that is. But there's some interesting information in this report.

99
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,800
Or at least the summary of the report. Let's see, podcasting also popular among 35 to 54

100
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,040
year olds. And I love this higher income, better educated consumer segments. Hey, in other words,

101
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,640
we got smart motherfuckers doing this. Let's see, 18 to 24 year olds represented a substantial

102
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,920
share of the audience, 20 percent, and one more than twice as likely as the average internet user

103
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,720
to download podcast. People between the ages 35 to 54 represent about half of the podcasting

104
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,920
audience and are also more likely than average to download podcast. So I put a link to whatever this is,

105
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,760
I'm not going to show where to come from. I don't know. It's a press release. So I'll put that

106
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,640
up on daily source code.com so you could check it out. A lot of response. Yes, I do.

107
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:48,880
It was quite cool. We had the hit test. The young pull at the sent in yesterday. And if

108
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,480
email, of course, exploding. So I think we can actually pull this off as fair use under the,

109
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,880
which of course means it can't be sponsored and it can't really, unless it's paid for by the

110
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,880
government education fund. If we treated it as an educational moment where helping people understand

111
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,240
music and the importance of it, we can kind of get away with it as long as not playing a whole

112
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,200
track. You know, of course, we have the half second rule now that the young put in place. And if we

113
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,160
shorten, oh, gosh darn. Is that a part of the whole exercise thing? I'm supposed to just like be

114
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:29,600
bourbon. Let me see what else can we do here. Oh, show girls. Remember, they were whining a couple of weeks

115
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,960
ago and Franklin sent in a comment and it's kind of, you know, it's I can't quite explain it,

116
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,480
but I find myself like not being able to not listen to the show because sometimes, and they actually

117
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,640
had an explicit tag on this one. Sometimes they do take their conversations a bit far. When you

118
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,600
get like six or seven women sitting together. And I wonder if this is how a women really talk.

119
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,840
Of course, it's on Skype or something like that. So it's not a completely natural conversation.

120
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,280
But on the most recent episode, they talk about a lot of things. And for some reason, they started

121
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,920
sharing their Adam Curry moments. That's kind of listen to it. That's my little Adam's story. Thank

122
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:18,800
you. That's nicely, nicely described. That was pod chick. She did a whole thing too long time ago.

123
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,440
Let's get your Adam moment and how did you get into pod casting? Since we're on the topic.

124
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,920
Can I as well? Oh, wow. It was you, Frank. I think it was you. That's the room of girls.

125
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,800
Frank, you got to Adam moment. So Frank is the person who got me into pod casting. Sorry.

126
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,960
I'm just kidding. But um, when my Adam moment is probably when I met him, and he thought he was

127
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,800
really a nice guy. I just met him quickly. I didn't really get to talk to him too much, but

128
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,840
when the grab is gone, when the grab is fine. I don't remember any of this. I think we

129
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,960
met at the the first pod cast, Expo. I don't remember any ass grabbing. Is this the way the

130
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:11,600
girls remember? I think I would have remembered. Only I've limited time. I don't have time to

131
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,000
just sit around and talk to everybody else. Right to the good. I feel rough. I got to talk to

132
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,160
him, but I didn't get to grab him. Well, it scares me not everybody's allowed to. So, I mean,

133
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,040
to him, I think he's done what I didn't get to him. But, so maybe I need to do something to try.

134
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,640
I mean, I talked to him. Karen hasn't talked to him. I haven't grabbed his butt. I mean, we should call

135
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,720
him instead. Is that soccer girl saying that she needs to grab my butt? If with him, maybe we need

136
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,800
our Adam moment. We need to have our time. Now we, we haven't really talked to him.

137
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Sad to say, but my Adam, I'm saying, we should, we should totally put together an audio thing

138
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,880
of all of us or however many of us to send Adam. Yeah. Yeah. We should get him on our show.

139
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,480
Frank, we talked him that one time, but, you know, we still haven't talked to him, so I think we

140
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,880
this is true. He needs to talk to the ladies. And by the way, PW Fenton is on this show.

141
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,280
And he's on the, you know, what's up with that? I used to go listen to it. It's a showgirls

142
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,520
that podshow.com. Let's listen to it. We need to do some sort of promo, something or other

143
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,320
for the daily source code, too. Yeah, make it sexy. Make it sexy. Let's see if Adam would come on the show.

144
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,920
Maybe, maybe when he's back in America, he could do it. No, you guys got to convince me if you

145
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:37,520
really want me to do that. I can't see, uh, this is Chris Ayer, confident.

146
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,840
I'm gonna get my money to burn. I'm gonna have a dog out of it. Yeah, it's all good.

147
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,280
We'll take the look and says a curse. I'm sure, we'll watch dirty. I'm treating you up here. I got a good

148
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:19,200
left up to get my way through. So I have left up and sing about the joy. But then I'm gonna bring

149
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,080
like a person in the old man. And I'm tired with someone. Another guy in the old, you know,

150
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,040
the things that I think are awful right now. I could use it, yeah. But I know I won't use it,

151
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:42,080
but now I could use a carpet on. Children these days drink red wine,

152
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,280
but find their glory in design and never stood perfect and integrated.

153
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,520
I bloody burn and a curse and fight, you take your wings so that you might as soon

154
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,440
learn a puppet shit up, find the meat. But ain't it greedy at home? He this buddy never

155
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,720
learns and takes his over time and gets a money to burn. He's a lovely dog out and looking for the

156
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,520
day. What do you know, this is a curse? I'm sure, we'll watch dirty. I'm treating you up here.

157
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:18,720
You got a good left up to get your spray clear. Can I get left up and sing about the joy?

158
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:26,320
But I'm gonna bring like a person in the old man. And I'm tired with someone. Another guy in the

159
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,120
old, you know, the things that I think are awful right now. I could use it, yeah. But now I'm

160
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:40,960
only using it right now. I could use it, yeah. Square pink, around hole, an unreleased soul,

161
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,920
with enough sandpaper. You're gonna think just fine. Square pink, around hole,

162
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,280
an unreleased soul, with enough sandpaper without cement, with enough memories,

163
00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:03,360
without the regret. You gonna think just fine, you don't think just fine. I live but I've ever learned.

164
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,320
I take my over time and get my money to burn. I'm another dog out and looking for the day.

165
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,320
You're gonna think just fine. I'm sure, we'll watch dirty. I'm treating you up here.

166
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,320
You got a good left up to get your spray clear. You got a good left up to get your spray clear.

167
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:28,320
But now I'm gonna bring like a person in the old man. And I'm tired with someone.

168
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Another guy in the old, you know, the things that I think are awful right now. I could

169
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,320
use you well. But now I'm only using it right now. I could use it, yeah.

170
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Oh, I see it. But now I could use you.

171
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Yeah, tell me you don't like that, huh?

172
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
It comes in.

173
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,320
Yeah, it's got pretty cool. It's Chris A.

174
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,320
One, the 2006 John Lennon Award for the songwriting.

175
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:10,320
For a songwriting in the folk category.

178
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Hey, you know, so I'm getting a little sweaty here. And I'm going to cut it short. Oh, by the way,

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,320
obviously, uh, no trip, uh, no flying today. Once again, just completely crap.
