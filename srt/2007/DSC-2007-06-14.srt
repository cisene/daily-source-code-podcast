00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
This is Chef Mark from Remarkable Palette and Jennifer from Food Philosophy.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,900
We've got the perfect recipe for seasoning your pocho experience to perfection.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,800
Start with a network full of informative content and talented podcasters.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,600
Add a heaping tablespoon of great listeners who can make the experience even better with their feedback.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,000
Perhaps your dashboard isn't mashing or you're having trouble locating that fantastic podsafe song you heard.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,400
Pocho wants to know how you want your entertainment served.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,900
Just head on over to survey.pocho.com and register to add your own spice to the dish.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,400
And we like it spicy.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Hello Adam, this is contractura.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:50,400
As you would podge or seek to suck less, I want to assure your listeners on the DSC 618 that I can't drag you if I want to suck more.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,400
The thirst for blood has never been any better.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Excuse me why I step out for a bite.

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
And there really is such a brilliant thing.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,400
You can feel my heart breath passing by the stairs.

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,400
When I'm asleep, there's layers on the floor.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
And suddenly you can hear us.

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,400
I think it's, I think the quality is just too good.

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,400
I don't want to be on TV anymore.

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,400
I was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
The next generation radio content in my ears.

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,400
I don't want to be on TV anymore.

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,400
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,400
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,400
I'm testing this Adam Curry.

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,400
When you go to my room,

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I've got to stay on my way down.

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
You're stuck in the sky.

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400

When you go to my room,

66
00:04:51,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Oh, that was kind of a wrap it in there. Yes, if you want to grab that mash up for free

67
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Just to go check out the show knows daily source code calm. Hey, it's episode 618 a daily source code

68
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm back from Los Angeles. It was very early to rise this morning up at 5 o'clock for a 720 amp flight

69
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Boy, do I miss the Delta Sierra on days like this, huh?

70
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Although it's it's never really good to have to fly yourself when you're going to do business because then you can make stupid decisions

71
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Uh, so the, you know, as I do in the morning up and at him

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,400
And let's just do a quick I always do a quick check of email on my phone in bed

73
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,400
And the first email I got is from good old PW Fenton who said well, I'm sure you're already aware of this but

74
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,400
A curry dot com has expired and so there's a couple of ugly secrets that of course immediately are exposed

75
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,400
I'm one of those lazy bastards, you know, I still haven't fixed my not completely fixed my email problem at curry dot com

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Well, so so to have I not transferred curry dot com to a go daddy

77
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,400
So extra egg on my face this morning

78
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Luckily I was able to renew it's funny because it's like it was it was bound to happen because you know the email

79
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,400
This is one of these domains I registered for 10 years, you know, so you know you forget about that stuff

80
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Curry dot com of course it had it a long time and

81
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:32,400
You know, I'm sure that they were sending emails to me saying I do it is about the expire along with a couple of other choice domains

82
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
I might add

83
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,400
But of course I wasn't getting that email the curry dot com email and ask just one bad loop

84
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:47,400
What else did I renew but dot org refer dot net? Yes, all kinds of a wonderful domains

85
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,400
I want to hold on to and I don't want to have expire under my very nose

86
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Hey, it got a lot of stuff to go through with you today

87
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Just so many calls that came in and so many fun things and I mean just prepping for the show today

88
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,400
I was laughing my ass off and you know, what do you expect when you've got like

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip

90
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,400
How did it all add on your aggregation of podcast feeds into channels would be more useful if

91
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Users would be able to slice podcasts and gather pieces of podcasts too

92
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,400
CSB cutting right to the bone man. I got a lot of feedback on the on the DSC channel that I created

93
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,400
I'll put the link into these show notes once again

94
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,400
So you just click on it and it'll open up your iTunes and automatically bring in everything that is intended to come in

95
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,400
It's kind of a test, but it's also me showing off something that's coming very soon in something

96
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,400
You can start playing with today already and you must have gotten 15 different emails

97
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,400
People who are you know, lights are going off in their heads about about how powerful this really is

98
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,400
And how cool it's going to be and how cool it is today when you can actually use some of that stuff

99
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:19,400
And CSB yeah, you know, so besides being able to create a channel which of course you can put on your iPod or anything else that understands RSS

100
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Those of you who give a shit

101
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,400
You can also put on your Apple TV let's put it that way anything that you think up with iTunes, I guess so including your iPhone

102
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,400
And you can also do single episodes this more that you can do, but I'm just going to keep it with shows and episodes at this particular point

103
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,400
So what CSB is saying is very much like our search if you search for anything

104
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:52,400
It'll not only bring up shows with the relevant to what your search term but also episodes that have something relevant in there

105
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:59,400
So you know we're already parsing a lot of that and we're already looking at show notes and obviously it would be just a small step

106
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Although I'm sure an engineering nightmare, but a small step to integrate an engine that understands that so good point to CSB but baby steps first

107
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,400
And not just whole episodes, you know such channels with user-defined podcast clips

108
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Regarding the work I don't agree with nylon and I recognize that he's a very able addition to pod show after all it was me myself or I who suggested

109
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:38,400
In co-coff between myself and Marcus Shemotonium Coff that pod show needs tech podcasts by the way everybody, please check podfinderuk.pot show.com

110
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Where boobly issues just a thin Lawrence was talking about myself in episode number 13 and Adam Kerry please stop masturbating to keynotes of Steve Jobs

111
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Good say

112
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
CSB

113
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Yeah, man, it's so good when you send something in you just never you never disappoint my friend

114
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
I

115
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Speaking of masturbating, Steve Jobs

116
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Keynote, hold on a second

117
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
I got a great email

118
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,400
And I have to go and find that it was someone told his wife, okay, I'll tell the story

119
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,400
So he was telling his wife about I'm sure I had that email somewhere

120
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:44,400
You know about how geeky I was talking about stuff including the sound of the Commodore VIC-20 computer program

121
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Well, okay, I seem to have misplaced the email

122
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,400
I don't understand that let me check one more time, do you mind?

123
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Like you you can always just fast forward until a crap anyway

124
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,400
So it was wife calls in on the or leaves an I think he sent an audio comment

125
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
And that she sounds really hot

126
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Take away the Jaguar

127
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Leave behind your precious Cessna 182 RG

128
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Strip away your trinkets of fame and fortune

129
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,400
VIC-20, Nokia E61 I

130
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Crackberry

131
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Let go of your big hair Adam

132
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Tape up the bridge of those rose colored glasses and admit it

133
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Come on Adam

134
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
I admit it

135
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
You're a fucking key

136
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
I found it

137
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Share her name is Barbara

138
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Darren Wall's wife

139
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Oh dude

140
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Send a picture next time

141
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Don't you guys understand

142
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
So

143
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
I don't know which one to play first

144
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,400
You know so there's something that's starting to happen now with in pod show

145
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,400
That I'm really liking and I wish more people in pod show would do it

146
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Guys and gals who work at the company

147
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I'm now calling into the show and talking about you know whatever they're doing

148
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
And whatever they're working on

149
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
And so we've got this new guy Adam

150
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Who we call A to the B so we don't confuse it with A to the C

151
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:21,400
And he came in and he fell in like second week

152
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,400
He was in charge of the the the super panel

153
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
This is the the suck less zone

154
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Which I'm sure you've heard a lot about

155
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,400
And so he's basically it's his job to track this

156
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Make sure the campaign is running

157
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,400
And it's a pretty big one and and it's pretty intense as you can imagine

158
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Particularly just because of the the massive sweep of that word that we spread out to kick this off

159
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,400
And now it's really up to the the members of the network

160
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
To really make this work if you will

161
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,400
And so here's A to the B with a

162
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Haha

163
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Dude you're gonna get ripped or shreds

164
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
I'm warning you now

165
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Erie is with a status report

166
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,400
And now on to the quick cyclist update

167
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
So one feedback's awesome

168
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,400
The the stuff that's written the stuff that's filled out in the survey

169
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
It's fantastic

170
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,400
We're measuring the ever living stuff out of this thing

171
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Ever living crap out of it

172
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
We add it to new measurements the other day

173
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,400
And it's very interesting

174
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,400
I am basically just so jazzed about what we're learning

175
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,400
And I can't wait to talk to some of our podcasters about it

176
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400

194
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Hi Adam

195
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
It's Jamie here from Birmingham

196
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,400
I've been for a lot of listening to the past couple of days

197
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
About the also testing

198
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
I've been catching up on my podcast for I've been away

199
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,400
And I didn't really think much about it all actually

200
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
To be honest

201
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
But I was just watching texture

202
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,400
And I've just seen the video version of the

203
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Cirquef advert

204
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,400
And you know I'm a man I'm quite even slayed

205
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,400
But oh my god how foxy

206
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
This sock of your look

207
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
And because of that

208
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
As soon as I'm getting into work

209
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
I'm putting out a questionnaire man

210
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
See if it's a good work

211
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,400
I know I love the video version

212
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,400
The video version is it's it's awesome

213
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Excuse me

214
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Sorry to me to do that in your ear

215
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
And I'll get that

216
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
One little wet spot out

217
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Yeah

218
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
We were in Los Angeles today

219
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
And soccer girl came up actually

220
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,400
You know and I can't tell you exactly what we're doing

221
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,400
But obviously no damn announcements

222
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
You're here about it

223
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,400
It could be extremely cool if everything works out

224
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
But you know so it's a meeting

225
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
And there's some you know some folks there

226
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
And some of them had suits on

227
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
And you know and that was this

228
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,400
And then I'll send the somehow that it's typical Hollywood right

229
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,400
The and by the way my computer was hooked up to a huge LCD

230
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,400
I used plasma screen and that really good sound in this room

231
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
So you know from time to time as we were talking

232
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
I was showing different things

233
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
From the network and playing different audio

234
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Drops and bits like that

235
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
And so you know someone said well you know

236
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
But I was talking about

237
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Lonely girl 15

238
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
And yeah they're coming out with that

239
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
What did they call it

240
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,400
I was like deep product integration

241
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Yeah so I lonely girl 15 with deep product integration

242
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,400
I mean like host endorsements that they're covering up

243
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Unlike where we're just saying it

244
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
And then I and then I I had

245
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,400
The the soccer girl episode

246
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Where she's in the burka which by the way

247
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Is one of the best pieces of work I've ever seen soccer girl do

248
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,400
And just to back that up I'm going to put that

249
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
Into the daily source code channel feed

250
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
After I'm done with the show

251
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
So you can see that that particular episode

252
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
It's awesome and it really is

253
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
I already love soccer girl

254
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,400
But when I saw that you know that's that is raw talent

255
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
And I popped that up man with the burka

256
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Cause it starts off really funny and then it gets real serious

257
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
And then just like rip your heart out

258
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Um and I said this

259
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Is the real lonely girl

260
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Then the new one improved

261
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400

Hey you've got a new sponsor

280
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
For the UK

281
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Now of course I have a

282
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
World audience

283
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,400
But there is a lot of people in the UK listening

284
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
And it's kind of interesting

285
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,400
This is kind of a traditional way of promoting something

286
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
But what the heck

287
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
It's not too bothersome I don't think

288
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
This summer when you buy coke

289
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
You get music

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400

But you were talking about the great fun

337
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
We had in watching Mark Goodman

338
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400

The absolute travesty of the entire thing

342
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Was it number 20 out of the top 20

343
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Was the Eagles hotel

344
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400

We talked about the fact that it was number 20

349
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
For the next 10 songs

350
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
And even a bigger travesty

351
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Was that number 1

352
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Was Sammy Haguears

353
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
I can't drive 55

354
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Absolutely ridiculous

355
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Yeah

356
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I hope you will give me proper credit

357
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
However with by predicting

358
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
At the song number 19

359
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
That boosts trainsteens

360
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Born to run would be in the top 5

361
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
And it's in fact

362
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Good come in at number 3

363
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Anyway just wanted to give you a

364
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Heads up on that

365
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
To refresh your memory

366
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
It's off for me

367
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
It's off and back to work to pay the bills

368
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Thanks Adam

369
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
You can tell he was in radio

370
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Can't you?

371
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Hey Greg man

372
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Tell me what you're doing

373
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
What are you working on?

374
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
It's just us

375
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Yeah what like the some secret intelligence

376
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
You can't tell anyone

377
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
How do you pay the bills?

378
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
I wouldn't mind sharing that

379
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
You might even be elevated to savants

380
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Status my friend

381
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Chris from plainmadness.com

382
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
By the way Chris

383
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
I love your show

384
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
It's an awesome awesome show

385
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
You could turn down the radio

386
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
A little bit in the background

387
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Because it's sometimes

388
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Just you know

389
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Particularly as a pilot

390
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
I'm sorry

391
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Scratch that

392
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
As an airman

393
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
You know I'm tuned into listening to what's being said on the radio

394
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
I find myself listening through you

395
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
To what is going on in the background

396
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
So maybe just turn down a little bit

397
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
I said hey I click the link

398
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
iTunes brought up the link in the podcast

399
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
We know low to the data

400
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Change the link to a channel name

401
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
And down came the shows

402
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Pretty cool I must say

403
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Everything works fine for me so far

404
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
What's interesting

405
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
He says I speculate that

406
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Potio now also becomes a library

407
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Data of sorts

408
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
That we can export to iTunes if we wish

409
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Why yes

410
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
You can do that today

411
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Did you know that?

412
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
But then you do lose the control over it

413
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
From you know the

414
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
You lose control over creating the channels

415
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
That's what's so cool about what we're doing with these channels

416
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
In fact

417
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
For those of you who've been following along

418
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
You know

419
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Or for those of you who are new to this story

420
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Let me put it that way

421
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
I go to dailysourcecode.com

422
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
You'll see a link for the DSC channel

423
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Just click it

424
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
If you have items on your computer

425
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,400
I'll also put a traditional RSS feed in there for the more adventurous

426
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Just click it if you have iTunes

427
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Or if you have an iPod then presumably you also have iTunes

428
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
It'll open up

429
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
It'll open up this channel

430
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
And it'll start to download

431
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
I do a video intro for the channel

432
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
So it's almost like

433
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Gosh

434
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I stop smoking

435
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
And I got all this flowing my throat

436
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,400
So it's a different way of distributing

437
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Serialized content

438
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
I guess

439
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
But it's really fun

440
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Because I can put stuff in that

441
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Updates automatically

442
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
I can put a show in there

443
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Just a single episode

444
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Now here's something

445
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,400
If you've been playing around this for a day or two

446
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Try this

447
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,400
So first

448
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Oh man

449
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Maybe I should just say

450
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
If you want to try this

451
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Here's how you do it

452
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
If you register for pod show

453
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
You automatically have a channel

454
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Go into search for any term

455
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Find a show

456
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Click on the show

457
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
It'll take you to the unofficial show guide page

458
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
And from there

459
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
Find an episode

460
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Not the show

461
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
Just find an episode

462
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
And click on get it

463
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
And then put it into your channel

464
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Which will be the name of your login

465
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Whatever your user name is

466
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Now then go to something called my collection

467
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
And this is all the shit

468
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
We're going to simplify

469
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,400
We're very close to having this right

470
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,400
And what you see on the side is

471
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Fucked up and wrong

472
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
But it's going to be awesome

473
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Go to your collection

474
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
And you'll see your channel there

475
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
And click on it because you want to

476
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Modify something

477
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
And you'll see that you can have it

478
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Play in the mashboard or iTunes

479
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Or it has different players

480
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Or even the raw XML

481
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Just select iTunes

482
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Save it

483
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
And then go to the play button

484
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
On that channel

485
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Don't click it

486
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
But right click it

487
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
And copy that link

488
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Okay

489
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
That is the link that anyone can use

490
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
You send that link to anybody

491
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
And email

492
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
They click on it

493
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
And iTunes will open up

494
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,400
And then whatever you have collected in that channel

495
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Shows or episodes

496
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
We'll go to their iPod

497
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Now here's the advanced fund

498
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
For people who've been doing this a day or two

499
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
And God, it's so hard to explain

500
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
It's almost like Tevo

501
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,400
You can't really explain it

502
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Take the link of your channel

503
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Would I just explain how you do that

504
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
You want to get the raw XML link

505
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Okay

506
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
And import that

507
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
As a show

508
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Okay

509
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
You just say add show

510
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
You can do it in the same channel even if you want

511
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Which makes it a real mind trip

512
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Once it's imported

513
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,400
You'll see the show is right there

514
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
The same icon will be there

515
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
That you put in the original channel

516
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Click on it

517
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
You'll now have your channel

518
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
We'll now have an unofficial guide page

519
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
That people can comment on

520
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,400
So that of course is not the way that this is supposed to work

521
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
But that is going to be the type of functionality

522
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Where people can comment on your channel

523
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,400
And your channel actually becomes like a show

524
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
I love this

525
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm not doing a great job really

526
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
I'm explaining it yet

527
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
You just have to kind of do it

528
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Christian Teberg says

529
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Just a quick reminder

530
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
My pod breeze app

531
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Pod breeze dot wordpress dot com

532
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
For the data side

533
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Can import your pod show channels

534
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
And subscribe to them

535
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
For those of us who don't want to use items

536
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Awesome

537
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
This is what's a nice about it

538
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
It all just kind of all works together

539
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Oh man

540
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
When we get this channel stuff pushed out

541
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400

542
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Let me see

543
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Was there anything else that I had

544
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
In my Gmail

545
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Oh no

546
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
But we do have another sabond coming your way

547
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Not a big program

548
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400

You'll be ready by the way

562
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Big meeting

563
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Sales with a Greg

564
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
In New York

565
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Thursday

566
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
On it

567
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Um

568
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Regarding the

569
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Sexless

570
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Me

571
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,400
With very simply practicing at this point

572
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Um

573
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Yes, the meme

574
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
There is a set in law that says

575
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
There is a

576
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Container

577
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Suckiness

578
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Suckness in the world

579
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Oh

580
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Oh, I didn't hear

581
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Suckiness

582
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Suckness in the woods

583
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
There is a

584
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Container

585
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Suckiness

586
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Okay, I got it

587
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,400
There is a law that there is a certain amount of

588
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Suckiness in the world is that it

589
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
There is a Container

590
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Suckiness

591
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Suckness in the world

592
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Suckness in the world

593
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Suckness in the world

594
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
So I guess cultural ones

595
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
As podcasts

596
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Suck as opposed to you

597
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
And I refer it this way

598
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Anyway

599
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Here's what

600
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Help me to say

601
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Right

602
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
I don't want anyone to suck more

603
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
I want us to suck less

604
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
What did you say at the end there?

605
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
Anyway

606
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Anyway, here's

607
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Up to me here soon

608
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,400
Right

609
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Okay, cheers

610
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Talk to you soon

611
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Ha ha ha

612
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
The prolific program everybody

613
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Whoa

614
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
He's an island

615
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Outspoken expatriate

616
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
He's an island

617
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
What can we do?

618
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
What can we do?

619
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
What can we do?

620
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Whoa

621
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
He's an island

622
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Controversely an island

623
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
He's an island

624
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
He's an island

625
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,400
But he's from New York

626
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Toooo

627
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Hey, I haven't missed the nylon

628
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,400
I've just finished taking three Tylenol PMs

629
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
I think it's actually been like me

630
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
That was devastating

631
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
But the Tylenol does work

632
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I don't even know

633
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Sorry

634
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
At least the heartache is gone

635
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
I like you

636
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
I just disagree

637
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I can believe

638
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Did I say I hate you?

639
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
I guess I did say I hate you

640
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
But I love you that you call in

641
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
I love you that you have a different opinion

642
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,400
So please don't let that stop you from calling in

643
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
And as long as

644
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
I shoot man

645
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
I mean already you've stolen my heart today

646
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
You're pimpin' out Tylenol PM for me

647
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I want to come back to the John DeForex thing

648
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
And again, I have nothing to just John

649
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
He's well respected

650
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
More accomplished and famous than I'll ever be

651
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Yeah, so far we got like two savons again

652
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
She men

653
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
We got the prolific programmer

654
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
He's against you

655
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
And comics are blogger

656
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
And he's pretty much against everything I do

657
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
to start with

658
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
I thought YouTube would have agreed on this

659
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
So you're in the minority

660
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
My friend is better be good

661
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
My organization of point of view

662
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,400
It seems like this is a guy who you have to pull

663
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Screaming and dragging to promote potential

664
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
So my last couple of data points

665
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,400
One, not much hype on cranky deeks

666
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Two and even though you reference the press release

667
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
The corporate thing

668
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Not a very good one

669
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
How many press releases have you seen

670
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Where the last paragraph says a quote

671
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,400
You know, so you're not even a quote from John

672
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Saying along the typical things of

673
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
I'm so happy to be associated with part show

674
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,400
It's a leading company and I'm so glad

675
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
No, that's bullshit

676
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
That's bullshit now

677
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Our bullshit's much better than that

678
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
What press release were you reading?

679
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Hold on a second

680
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
I had it here somewhere

681
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Uh

682
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Crap

683
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Here it is

684
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Partial press room

685
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
One

686
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Open this up

687
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Hot these lenses

688
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
I gotta get rid of these lenses

689
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Why is it

690
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Oh man, Google notebook

691
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
It doesn't quite cut it

692
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Does it?

693
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Okay, here it is

694
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
There's a quote from John C.

695
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Dvorak here

696
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Um

697
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Technology has given us this massive

698
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Distribution medium

699
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
He had our approach to producing

700
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Technology content has been in the same old

701
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Productible style

702
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,400
Comments Dvorak

703
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,400
I work with pod shows new channel format

704
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
We can combine entertainment and insight

705
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
And take the concept of integrated programming

706
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
To an entirely new level

707
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
If that doesn't say pod show fucking rocks

708
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
I don't know what

709
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
So though the hype

710
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
You think of these telecolt from John

711
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,400
So all I'm saying is that for a guy who's a VP

712
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Imagine editor of your organization

713
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,400
It seems like he reluctantly talks about it

714
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
And very rarely

715
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
So

716
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,400
Yeah, but dude, you know

717
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,400
You're talking about other people's media properties

718
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
It's just not appropriate

719
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
He doesn't own cranky geeks

720
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
He is a hired gun

721
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
It's not his show

722
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
He doesn't own twit

723
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
It's not his show

724
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
It's just not appropriate

725
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Okay

726
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
It's just not appropriate

727
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Don't worry

728
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
You know, he's working right now

729
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
He's not on the pimp

730
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
He's a smart guy

731
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
He's not going to go on pimp shit

732
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Like I'm doing about these channels

733
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Into the channels are working properly

734
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
And he's got the channels up and running

735
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
He's smart

736
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
He's laying low

737
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
And those press releases

738
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
That's corporate shit

739
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
Trust me

740
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Okay

741
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Go to pressroom.potshow.com

742
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
And you can see

743
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
They're all the same

744
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
It's the same format

745
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
I think we even still put the hash marks at the end

746
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
For teletype

747
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
By that the AP newsroom

748
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,400
It's just one thing you do

749
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Okay

750
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
You know

751
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
It's a leadership issue

752
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
That's all

753
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
And I know a little bit about that

754
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
I work with companies on those sort of issues

755
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
And I'm just saying you have a disconnect

756
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
For my point of view

757
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
In your leadership team

758
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
And you just think that connect those dots

759
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Dude, where do you work?

760
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Do you have a leadership team?

761
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
This is a leadership team

762
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
And a senior management

763
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Come on man

764
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Ah

765
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Nothing

766
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Because John

767
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Nothing against you

768
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah

769
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
It's just that thing

770
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
And he probably goes with the twins

771
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
And he probably goes with Christy

772
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Nothing against you

773
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Either nylon

774
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
And he probably goes with him to John

775
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
You know

776
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
For guy who's got a new job

777
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
If you wish

778
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
He doesn't talk about it

779
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
There's no passion

780
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
So I'm just saying

781
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Get the guy on board

782
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Dude

783
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Go listen to tech5.pacho.com

784
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,400
He's getting his gear together

785
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
He's doing a daily test show

786
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
If you will

787
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,400
TECH5.pacho.com

788
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
He's getting ready man

789
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Take it easy

790
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
You're on the inside

791
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Okay

792
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
You're on the inside

793
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
You're with all the cool kids

794
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
That's why you know these things

795
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Before anyone else really does

796
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Okay

797
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
You know

798
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
And make a more line

799
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
And that way

800
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
It won't seem to me

801
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
I'm all the other

802
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
That you know

803
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
He's kind of a

804
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Okay

805
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
nylon

806
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
You're killing me

807
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
You're killing me

808
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
That's all

809
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Let me go take another time

810
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
I'm all

811
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I'm sure you're going to say something

812
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
To upset me again

813
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Oh

814
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Burke

815
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
nylon

816
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
I love you man

817
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Please, I mean

818
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
If I didn't truly respect you

819
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
I mean, would I be

820
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Would I be playing this?

821
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Let's have a word

822
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
With the nylon

823
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Spreading the news

824
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
With the smile on

825
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Where the wrong old right

826
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
We'll go for light

827
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Let's listen

828
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
We'll go wild

829
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
To the nylon

830
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
Ah

831
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
Okay

832
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Let's talk about some other shit

833
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
For a second

834
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Oh it's

835
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Yeah

836
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
It's Eric Bergen's mom

837
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
You're my buddy

838
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
It's in Jersey Boys

839
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Now it's Los Angeles

840
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
With the hot girlfriend

841
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Who's also in the cast

842
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Hello

843
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Hi Adam

844
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Oh hi baby

00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
You're from Kraftcast

00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Also known as Eric Bergen's mother

847
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
I gotta tell you

848
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
The house shit

849
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
I'll wait until you're done

850
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Speaking of

851
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Thank you so much for that

852
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Oh reading of his review

853
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
On your show there

854
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
That was very sweet of you

855
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Thank you

856
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
And I just wanted you to know that

857
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
I'm listening

858
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
I'm not there

859
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Listening every day

860
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
So

861
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Oh

862
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
And I'm just wanted to also say

00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Congrats on that

864
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Not smoking thing

865
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
I know how far this stuff is to do

866
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
And I'm proud of you

867
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
It's very inspiring

868
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
So

869
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Good for you

870
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Okay

871
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
And then

872
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Can I tell you

873
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Alice and Tarty

874
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
And drove for a second

875
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
But

876
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Today

877
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Um

878
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Except when I got up this morning

879
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
I did not think about smoking

880
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
The entire day

881
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Until I got back home

882
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
We started doing the show

883
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Until I saw you all

884
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Listening to

885
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Let's see today is Tuesday

886
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Today's show

887
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Tuesday morning

888
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
I just wanted to fill you in on something

889
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
I dropped you an email way back

890
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
This whole channel thing

891
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Building your own channels

892
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
That's what happened to me with my show

893
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
What happened was

894
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Someone hijacked my feed

895
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
And

896
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Used it for a craft channel

897
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
So

898
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Loan behold when I went on to their

899
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Their site

900
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
And played my show

901
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
It started with a promo

902
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
And a commercial

903
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
For a particular craft company

904
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Yes

905
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
I did contact them

906
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
And I love their excuse

907
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
Their excuse was which always cracks me up

908
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Technical

909
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
You weren't supposed to see that

910
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Oh

911
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
And then

912
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Blame it on the serve

913
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
I knew it

914
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
I knew serve people

915
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Blame it on the serve

916
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
They released that

917
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Let me just let me just clarify one thing

918
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Dear

919
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
There is a difference between your show

920
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
And your feed

921
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Okay

922
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
They took your show

923
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
All right

924
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
They took it off your server

925
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
And

926
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
They made a copy of it

927
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
And we're redistributing a copy

928
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
This is something completely different

929
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,400
What we're talking about

930
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
The thing that we're doing with feeds

931
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
I mean it has a real

932
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Techn...

933
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Our entire system was built on this

934
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
And we've

935
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Typical Ron and Adam fashion

936
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
We've built everything upside down

937
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
Okay

938
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
I'm telling you

939
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
We've built everything upside down

940
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
We're going to infer that fucker

941
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
And it's all going to become clear

942
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
We're not supposed to hear that

943
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Anyway

944
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
They removed it

945
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
But the upshot of that is

946
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
They sold it

947
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
To someone as a craft channel

948
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
I think four different shows

949
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
To a sponsor

950
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
There's interest in it

951
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
So

952
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Yes, you know

953
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
I always find the positive side of everything

954
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
And that

955
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
You're so right, Alison

956
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
And there you go

957
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Do you think that if you have John C.

958
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
To Vorac hosting a channel

959
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Technology shows that it's marketable

960
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
I think so

961
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
He was just

962
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
We have some of that

963
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
And every category I think

964
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Sort of just said

965
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Hey

966
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
This is working

967
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
So

968
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
You know

969
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
It's all happening

970
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,400
And I listen with big open ears

971
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Mmm

972
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Every day

973
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
So

974
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Just wanted to you to know that

975
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Thinking about you

976
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
I'm listening to you

977
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
And I look forward to listening to more

978
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
So big hug babe

979
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Bye

980
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Oh

981
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Hey

982
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Now I've got dreams about

983
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
Yeah

984
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
By you

985
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Eric's girlfriend

986
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,400
Fuck, I didn't even do Eric, you guys are all just so hot

987
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Yeah

988
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
How do I do?

989
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,400
And this is David Cohen from Jersey, another Jersey boy called Michelle

990
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Yeah, you were mentioning Bill Filming

991
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Yeah

992
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
On one of the most recent episodes

993
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
And I thought you could get a kick out of it

994
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
That I'm watching last time

995
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
Extending tonight

996
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
And guess who the host is

997
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Is this here

998
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
That's right, your boy

999
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
Well awesome

1000
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Wait

1001
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Dude, cool

1002
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
I just missed that

1003
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
He was on the way to see

1004
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
I didn't watch it

1005
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Because you know

1006
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
I don't know, I got ready for the show

1007
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
I'm happy to hear that

1008
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
If anyone sees Bill Bill

1009
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Let me just tell him I said hey

1010
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
Okay

1011
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Hi Adam

1012
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
It's Michael Liff

1013
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Are you okay?

1014
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
I'm okay

1015
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
I just

1016
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
I think I've been listening to

1017
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
615

1018
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,400
And you were talking about

1019
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
You know, radio being stream

1020
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
And podcasts

1021
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
And you know, we're asking really what the difference is

1022
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
And you're really picked up on it

1023
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
And none of the last episodes

1024
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
One thing I wanted to mention

1025
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
I've never heard you talking about this

1026
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,400
I'm actually using a Wi-Fi video

1027
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Which is called the

1028
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
The Im Magic Box

1029
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Impeasant

1030
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
India

1031
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Michael

1032
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Peter

1033
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Papa

1034
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
And it's

1035
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
It's India Mike Papa

1036
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Actually it's India Mike Papa

1037
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Radio.com

1038
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
I'll let

1039
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
I'll end it for a second

1040
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
It's really good

1041
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
It links into your Wi-Fi network

1042
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
And when I bought it last year

1043
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
It was basically possible to

1044
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
You know, listen to any stream

1045
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
So it's a little box that runs Linux

1046
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,400
And you're basically able to

1047
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
To listen to like

1048
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
8,000 something

1049
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Radio streams and stations on the internet

1050
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
But one thing that's added recently

1051
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
To the firmware is

1052
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,400
There you can also now access podcasts

1053
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Which is something I requested

1054
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
And asked for last year on one of the four runs

1055
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
I hope you heard that

1056
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,400
This is something really significant that you just heard

1057
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
So first of all

1058
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
I checked that I looked it up online

1059
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
I'll put the link in the show notes

1060
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Imperadio.com

1061
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
IMP

1062
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
India Mike Papa

1063
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
And it's a kind of

1064
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Stylist looking radio

1065
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
Like a kitchen radio

1066
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Table top type radio

1067
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
And

1068
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
And you know it looks great for

1069
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
For internet radio and streaming stations

1070
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
But now apparently it's also

1071
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,400
Aware of how to get our type of media

1072
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,400
To get our version of internet radio

1073
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,400
And the third thing that I thought was interesting

1074
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,400
And that is that they added that

1075
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Into this radio

1076
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Into this consumer product

1077
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
After he requested it

1078
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
How cool is that

1079
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
I mean that's awesome

1080
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,400
I'd love to know a little bit more about

1081
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Exactly how it works

1082
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
And you know how the streaming

1083
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
That works does it

1084
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Take a feed or in this case

1085
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,400
Have you loaded a pod show channel on it?

1086
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
That's all I want to know

1087
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Just let me know how that went

1088
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
I'd love to hear more

1089
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
And it works really really well

1090
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
So that's one thing

1091
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
It's basically one place that

1092
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Combined pot cast and streams

1093
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
In a really good way

1094
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
And I've got one of those in my kitchen

1095
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
It's a great little gadget

1096
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Rock on

1097
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
The other thing I wanted to say is

1098
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,400
I'm a German living in the UK

1099
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,400
And I just wanted to thank you for the things

1100
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,400
You said recently about Germany and everything

1101
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,400
And I understand that you spend a lot of time

1102
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
If you're used in the Netherlands

1103
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
And you sort of grew up there

1104
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
And

1105
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Well, you know the place where I come from

1106
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,400
It's really close to the Dutch border

1107
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
And

1108
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
Well, you know, I don't know

1109
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,400
I always have been during the time when I grew up

1110
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,400
And they have always been a lot of

1111
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Any more cities is colliding like that

1112
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Between the Dutch and the Germans

1113
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,400
And I've seen a couple of pretty ugly things

1114
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,400
So for someone who's grown up in the Netherlands

1115
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,400
And then sort of now experience as the German side

1116
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
And I thought it was a really nice thing to say

1117
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,400
And it's great that the Germans could

1118
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Can surprise you in such a way

1119
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
And you talk about the Germans being

1120
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Curtiss and things

1121
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Just very kind and nice and huge experience

1122
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
But that's great. Anyway, I'll kind of show it

1123
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
And it's enough now

1124
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Great show, keep up a bit of work

1125
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
All the best, bye

1126
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Yeah, I really appreciate you saying that

1127
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
And it's funny because I was talking about that

1128
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Was wrong today

1129
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,400
As you know, we're about ready to make our move into Germany

1130
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,400
And I think I actually said it again

1131
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
You know, I said I'm really digging the Germans man

1132
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
It's like they're motivated

1133
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
They're really sharp, they're alert

1134
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
They're like, aren't you Curtiss?

1135
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Extremely Curtiss

1136
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,400
And you know, I kind of have a hypothesis about that

1137
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Now I moved to the Netherlands in 1972

1138
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
And so that was only

1139
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,400
About 30 years after the Second World War ended

1140
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Some odd, yeah, about 30 some odd years

1141
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
But that's not a lot of years, even less than that

1142
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
It's not a lot of years

1143
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
That's a generation

1144
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,400
A generation to half maybe

1145
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
So you know, you can only imagine

1146
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
What was being passed down

1147
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
The Germans really fucking annihilated

1148
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
A lot of that country

1149
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
And I know a lot about this

1150
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Having spoken a lot with my with my in laws

1151
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Who both from Rotterdam

1152
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Go have a look at Rotterdam and Wikipedia

1153
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
Even Wikipedia can't miss that

1154
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Fact that it was bombed to shit in the Second World War

1155
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,400
It's completely destroyed, beautiful, beautiful city

1156
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
And you know, I always noticed that

1157
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
There's some very stereotypical things

1158
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,400
That the Dutch will say about the Germans

1159
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
One is they always come

1160
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
Because the Germany has no beach

1161
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,400
So they come see words towards the Netherlands

1162
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
And what the big joke is

1163
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
Oh, here come the Germans

1164
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Because they're going to big dig holes in the beach

1165
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
And then put up their windbreaker screens around it

1166
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
And the other joke

1167
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Although I'm sure several cultures joke about this

1168
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Or generalize by saying

1169
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
Oh, you know, if you're on vacation to hotel somewhere

1170
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
At 6 a.m. the Germans are always downstairs

1171
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,400
Putting towels on the on the beds near the pool

1172
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
To like reserve them

1173
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
But I'll tell you, man

1174
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
I'm really excited about doing stuff in Germany

1175
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
I truly am

1176
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
And I look forward to learning a lot

1177
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,400
I think I think the Germans have been getting a bum wrap

1178
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,400
And what's funny is that

1179
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
Even while that situation certainly existed

1180
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,400
You know, 15, 20 years ago

1181
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
Was probably still pretty prevalent

1182
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Maybe even longer ago

1183
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Think about, you know, your thoughts about Iranians

1184
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Or Iraqis

1185
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Dude, I've been to Iraq

1186
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Fucking normal people

1187
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,400
We got along fine

1188
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Got a beef with them

1189
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,400
I gotta be with any people that we may or may not be at war

1190
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
With or threatened by or whatever

1191
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Been in Russia too, same thing

1192
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
And not like all KGB

1193
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
Low and behold

1194
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,400
And I think that's really what the internet is brought us

1195
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
Is

1196
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
And even though you don't stop to think about it

1197
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,400
Oh, this is maybe something for the thought of the final thought of the week

1198
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,400
But, you know

1199
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,400
All right, it used to be maybe that we were just sold a big ass

1200
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,400
Bunch of goods like these are evil people

1201
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,400
And the way people were portrayed on the media

1202
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
And now we have our own media

1203
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,400
We communicate with each other across

1204
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Vass geographic distances

1205
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,400
And hey, you know

1206
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,400
We all got a fucking mice-based image

1207
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,400
All right, the world is upside down

1208
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
The hardship I calm us upside down

1209
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,400
A barbed gentry

1210
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
Has just the lyrics

1211
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Describe how I feel

1212
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,400
I've been talking in my sleep

1213
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
When I'm waking

1214
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Well, my tongue is tight

1215
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,400
I've been thinking I should leave

1216
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Instead of waiting for her when the time is right

1217
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,400
I've backed the bags under my eyes

1218
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Well, I've seen enough to know what it's like

1219
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,400
It's turning me upside down

1220
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,400
Tell me what I've done wrong now

1221
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,400
All I can do is try it

1222
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,400
When everything's breaking me down

1223
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,400
Looking up the downside

1224
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,400
Well, those rules got changed somehow

1225
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Maybe it's suicide

1226
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,400
To stay here and just stick around

1227
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,400
I was able to hide every bruise on my body

1228
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Till now

1229
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,400
Till now

1230
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,400
I've been walking in my sleep

1231
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,400
When I'm waking up

1232
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Well, my legs are tight

1233
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,400
I've been thinking I should leave

1234
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,400
Put the window up

1235
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,400
It's a mare tonight

1236
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,400
I've been dreaming I could fly it

1237
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,400
Well, I'm free enough

1238
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,400
But I'm still way down

1239
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:53,400
It's turning me upside down

1240
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,400
Tell me what I've done wrong now

1241
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,400
All I can do is try it

1242
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,400
When everything's breaking me down

1243
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,400
Looking up the downside

1244
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,400
Well, those rules got changed somehow

1245
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,400
Maybe it's suicide

1246
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,400
To stay here and just stick around

1247
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,400
I was able to hide every bruise on my body

1248
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Till now

1249
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
Till now

1250
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,400
I've been afraid to just walk out

1251
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Ain't no way to stop me now

1252
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:51,400
It's turning me upside down

1253
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,400
Tell me what I've done wrong now

1254
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,400
All I can do is try it

1255
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,400
When everything's breaking me down

1256
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,400
Looking up the downside

1257
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,400
Well, those rules got changed somehow

1258
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,400
Maybe it's suicide

1259
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,400
To stay here and just stick around

1260
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,400
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now

1261
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,400
All I can do is try it

1262
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,400
Tell me what I've done wrong now

1263
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,400
All I can do is try it

1264
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,400
When all rules got changed somehow

1265
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,400
I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now

1266
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,400
All I can do is try it

1267
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,400
Oh my god

1268
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
It's so beautiful
