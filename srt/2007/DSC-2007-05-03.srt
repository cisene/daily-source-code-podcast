00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
Pearl, what you're doing at the brand new Pod Show HQ on the recently moved Pod Show Island

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,620
in Second Life, and why are you dusting that furniture?

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,580
Happy, you're not with it, you don't pay attention to anything.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,960
Pod Show Island is grand opening, this Friday with a huge concert by Jeff Smith and the

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,960
fun goes all the way through Sunday night with Pod Show music network favorite, the

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080
Sarah Mac Band closing out the weekend with a big show.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know all that M.B. has been doing things all over the island for

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,000
the grand opening, he has me setting up the stage for Jeff, he had me put furniture in

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,120
a curing manner, but why are you cleaning up in here?

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,760
Adam may be coming to the grand opening, I want to make sure his office is perfect, and

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,800
if Adam wants to be a mayor, then he's a mayor, and now he has the office to prove it.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,440
Wow, Adam, mayor of the island?

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,240
Wow, what a great office.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,240
Very, very cool.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,680
Ta-da, and I'll pee out.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,160
Hey, bro, let me introduce the show.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,160
DSC 5 9 4.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:36,800
What's out of sound, fast, build up, everybody round, build up, make it be no big,

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:47,120
what's up, build up, make it smooth, move my feet, fast, build up, sit my bones, and it's

20
00:01:47,120 --> 00:02:00,520
out of me, looks like cam is on, I feel like rhythm, if you like to dance, this is your

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:10,840
chance, I can't keep it still, the bungalows playing, I know everybody feels that way,

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:24,400
but it's in their boat, and it's out of music, cam is on, oh feel like rhythm, if you can be

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:35,240
strong, know that you want to hold those pain, and I'll dance all night and day, and I'll never

24
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:52,520
fall in my bones, it's out of me, looks like cam is on, I feel like rhythm, I feel like

25
00:02:52,520 --> 00:03:03,720
rhythm, if you can be strong, know that if you want to hold those pain, and I'll dance all night

26
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:20,760
and day, and I'll never fall in my bones, and it's out of the music, cam is on, I feel like

27
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:44,080
rhythm, if you like to dance, this is your chance, I can't keep it up, if you can be strong,

28
00:03:44,080 --> 00:04:05,040
you can be strong, know that if you want to hold those pain, and I'll dance all night and day, and I'll never

29
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:23,360
fall in my bones, and it's out of the music, cam is on, if you like to be strong, if you like to dance,

30
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:39,880
you'll never guess who that is, never guess, give up, would you believe it if I said the

31
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:49,540
Jeff Smith, the one and only Jeff Smith, with the impressions, attracted it over a year ago,

32
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,860
it turns out that song is now number one on the beach music charts. I love it. Fantastic. You

33
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,100
know that that's the kind of song that makes you feel cavo-k, which of course is the opposite

34
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,340
of fubar. Cavo-k, ceiling invisibility. Okay, I'm having a cavo-k day. How are you guys? It is daily

35
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,380
source code episode number 594 coming to you from the curry manner. I've got the windows open

36
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,380
up here in the attic. The wind is just kind of flowing by just wasping and wasping, wasping,

37
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,340
just kind of flowing in, trying to make it sound romantic. It really is another beautiful

38
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,940
day, a little cloudy this morning, but I think it's going to be good throughout the weekend. Good,

39
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,380
because of course I'm planning on flying over to the Netherlands, the Lady Patricia, performing

40
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:38,420
and dancing with the stars. I'll play the song tomorrow on the maximum music fubar friday. I'll

41
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:44,500
play it again for you. The new version of the star sisters proudly presents. It's fantastic.

42
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:52,100
Now she's on the road and kind of the way I do it. I'll call in once a day, usually in the evening,

43
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,220
so she calls and she calls Christina and then she'll call me, of course I'm always second banana.

44
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,980
But man, she's having a good time. When the Lady P is on the path man, she's like getting up at

45
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:11,460
seven doing radio interviews. She's got a huge interview in the National Paper coming up on

46
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,300
Saturday. She really wants people to watch. And of course there's a special surprise in this

47
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,900
performance that they're doing, which obviously I can't tell you about. And I know things are

48
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,500
heating up because I can see by the caller ID that the gossip television shows are now calling me,

49
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,420
trying to mind me for information. Of course, they just get rejected. I'm all alone once again,

50
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:40,420
and I think the dog is barking downstairs. So see, you hear that? Swabber! Swabber!

51
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,620
What happens is, I leave the door open so all the animals can go in and out and he walks out,

52
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,140
but then he doesn't have enough power and his hind legs to kind of vault himself back in

53
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,340
through the doorway and he stands that kind of like going, P, let me in!

54
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,540
I'll see if I can get a song going and I'll go downstairs and grab him real quick.

55
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,820
Hi Adam, this is Lisa from Orlando, Florida. I've been a take her for far too long,

56
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,740
and decided I should start giving something back. I did have a few points though.

57
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,380
To all the podcasters complaining about the PMM, shut the heck up!

58
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,740
The pod show helps make your show as possible with financial and technical support to say nothing

59
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,100
of those incredible bandwidth bills y'all don't pay for. Show some gratitude and stop complaining.

60
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:32,900
It's really not becoming. Number two, three words, more Patricia please. She is so talented and gracious,

61
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,180
and it's a real treat when she's on. Please let her know that.

62
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,780
Number three, I love podcasters. They have changed my life. I rarely watch TV, never listen to the

63
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,780
radio, but do listen and watch dozens of podcasters each week. One thing I'm really happy about is my

64
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:55,060
dad. He wrote a book 20 years ago and then did nothing with it. When I heard Scott's

65
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,020
saygler of earth core fame, almost two years ago on the DSC, talking about his potty of book,

66
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,460
and how authors were making their books into podcasters, I urged my almost 65-year-old dad to make

67
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,980
his own potty of book. I'm proud to say he's in the final stages of editing his first few episodes,

68
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,820
without you, his dream would still be sitting in a drawer. And finally, this new format is fabulous.

69
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,860
I'm really enjoying it. I'm always astounded at the people we have in our lives who have some secret,

70
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,500
or sometimes not so secret knowledge about something. Be a copyright law, how to care for

71
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,180
African violence, making to die for a whole week bread or whatever. I think we all have savants in

72
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,980
our lives, and thanks for reminding us of that. Have a great day, Adam.

73
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,420
And Adam? Yes. Folder. Oh, send a naked picture. Will you please? Nice voice. Thanks for

74
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:47,700
contributing, Lisa. Yeah. Well, absolutely. Of course, we all have savants in our lives. That's

75
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,780
the whole point. Today, not a new format, savant from the circle of savants, because today's show

76
00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:00,100
more about a savant of the musical kind, we started it off with Jeff Smith, with that song that

77
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,140
he did with the impressions, which I just love. Jeff does, I think I should do a show with Jeff.

78
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:11,380
And all of this is just, it's all, every topic, there's a song. Every little, you know,

79
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,900
I really can't, you know what, I don't normally do this, but I'm all alone. Hold on one second.

80
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,660
Sorry about that. I just paused everything to run downstairs and let the dog in.

81
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,340
And now, of course, I'm out of breath from running up and down the stairs so quickly.

82
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,900
I really got to get this dog like an invalid ramp or something, you know, because he can

83
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,660
hope, is it going to be one of those days? Let's see. Okay. Oh, man. Yes it is.

84
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,380
Why? Why or why? No one has used to my new format yet. Okay.

85
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:56,500
Uh, so what was I saying about, uh, oh, yes. No, no Cirque de Sivant, uh, Ojo Dwi.

86
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,220
Is it Ojo Dwi? Yeah, I think, no. Today, whatever. Oh, you too.

87
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,540
Instead, uh, got something cool coming up from the Jeff Smith.

88
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,260
Man, I'm really out of breath.

89
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:17,300
So I don't know if you followed the story about the, uh, copy protection key code to the HD DVD.

90
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,820
Disks. I'm, I'm going to try and explain this because it's very, very geeky, but it

91
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,300
had already showed up in the New York Times because it's something just things happened.

92
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:35,300
So there's this code and this code literally consists of, um, I don't know, like 15 or 16 different

93
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:44,180
pairs of letters or numbers. So like, you know, hexadecimal code to like F0, um, three A, you know, so

94
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:51,140
it's like 16 or 17 of those pairs. And that is the actual key that allows you, um, on, um,

95
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:57,380
on the player on Linux to actually crack the HD DVDs, uh, copy protection so that you could then

96
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:03,620
copy them. Now, as a part of the digital millennium copyright act, uh, and this stems back to an

97
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,820
original, uh, DVD code crack I believe. I'm just kind of paraphrasing in here. I'm not exactly

98
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,900
sure of the history. Um, there was a similar code. If it, it may even be the same one to hell to

99
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:22,420
I know, uh, but in this, in this law, in this, uh, DMCA on this act was put that no one has allowed

100
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,700
to publish this, uh, this key because this key essentially allows anyone under the right circumstances

101
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:33,700
with proper knowledge, uh, to copy, uh, HD DVD discs. And so you're not even allowed to publish it,

102
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:39,620
or, uh, or even dream about it, it seems. You just, you can't have this, this code, this string of,

103
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,420
of, of numbers and letters. You cannot have it anywhere in your possession. Certainly not put it

104
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:52,260
on a, uh, on a website. So this got posted to dig.com. And, uh, so by now you probably, if you're like,

105
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,180
uh, kind of geeky and you live in the blogosphere, there's no way you could have avoided this story.

106
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,660
If not, then, you know, here you go. It's one of these stupid things. And it also really showed

107
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,420
what the dig audience is all about. So it's, it showed up on dig and, um, uh, and the guys at dig

108
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:13,860
removed that story. And so the, the audience of dig.com revolted and then every single story was basically

109
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,980
this code that was being put up and people were putting it up in picture format and pointing to it

110
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:26,420
in different places and using face folk, uh, fake subject lines. Um, and so it was like pandemonium

111
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,500
for a while and then it kind of died down. Um, so now people are starting to come up with all these

112
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:37,380
fun ways of, uh, of, uh, of mentioning this code, uh, and trying to get it published essentially.

113
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,180
It was, it's kind of like, uh, the equipment, like, uh, I'm going to light off a bottle rocket in school.

114
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,460
You know, it's not, it's not really a huge deal, but it's a really geeky thing. And it was a

115
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,980
talking to Mark Yoshimo to name coffee yesterday. And I played this, this fantastic comment.

116
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,060
Uh, I got a set of them up right home.

117
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,820
So this, of course, is, uh, one of our ubers of aunts and, uh, prolific program will

118
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,140
wouldn't be pp if, if he didn't try and sneak the code into one of his collins.

119
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,820
I haven't been programming it from dad runs to scope. I just noticed that dig is going to

120
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:29,860
ship shit. Apparently they, they are censoring the HDD code, namely, O9 F9 1 1 0 2 9 day 7 4 E 3 5 B D 8 4 1 5 6

121
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:39,380
C 5 6 3 5 6 8 8 C 0. Now I, I suspect the cops are going to look as arrest me. So I get very, very

122
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:47,540
going. Cheers. So, some parking lot cracking up over that. Like, I mean, I can't believe that.

123
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,860
So difficult, a prolific program to call the code in fantastic. Now we're all going to the

124
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,700
big house boy. And then Mark says, oh, man, you know, someone should make a make an edit a song.

125
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,220
I don't know that. And I said, shit, a song. Let's call Jeff Smith. He should totally do a song.

126
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,060
You know, he'll do a great job. So already we've gone from like prolific program or

127
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:16,500
to Mark and Adam to the Jeff Smith. And the, and the this morning, now available. If you go to

128
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:24,100
geek brief TV geek brief dot pot show dot com, you will see a video clip a music video for the song

129
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,700
that Jeff Smith wrote this happened all within span of like 18 hours. It's been unbelievable. Do we have

130
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,940
a fucking network? Do we have a network? Do we have a network? I love it when this stuff happens.

131
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,220
And Callie and Neil did an awesome job. Have you ever seen the the Dylan video? I think in

132
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:46,500
access that it as well, where the basically holding like cue cards with words on it. And that goes

133
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:53,220
along with the synchronized with the lyrics. I think you know what I mean. Anyway, I'm going to play

134
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:59,540
the song for you. You'll hear the code cleverly hidden. So it can live on in perpetuity because,

135
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,700
songs have an interesting knack of yeah, you can destroy the original file. But once someone's got

136
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,660
the song in their head, then we're all going to have this code embedded in our minds.

137
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:23,140
It's called Dick the Code. No BDI WG. Jeff Smith added again. I guess we can't publish the lyrics

138
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,540
and do the top to memorize it.

Embedding the code in our brains as well

147
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:41,140

155
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,420
That's all

156
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:50,220
