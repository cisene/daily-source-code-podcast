1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charley's 6-0-9-er.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm just kidding.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a battle curry.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Shag said,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Like hey, scuba look at her bones.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was glued to the tube,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Like a bad habit.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I got a heart on for Jessica Rabbit.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The station can't believe I'm any tunes.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I had been craving masturbation.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh my god.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah, you know what?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Eat the moths of all three girls.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Power pop.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I do the little mermaid with legs of fans.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Take a swim, get laid.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Then throw it back in.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Sift Jasmine from Aladdin.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Need to stab it.

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No white, I do that whole right all night.

Ha ha ha ha ha.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Like flipper.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
These are the cartoons.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I like to burn.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000

And laugh, mother and son.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000

Now I don't know if it's wrong.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Do you want a shag?

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But I think I do bugs bunny and drag.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Uh, maybe not.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But I'd love to get some wet pun from Miss Judy Jetsun.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let Josie and opposing cats get me wet.

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm the only one in the village doing smart fit.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I can wonder woman time me up with your labyrinth.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Betty Rubble and I could do it on a boulder.

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And I'd be fucking pebbles if she was a little older.

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, I need a tasty piece of bill from beauty.

55

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, these are the cats.

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I like to burn.

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Come on, mother and children.

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come on, mother and everybody.

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Come on, mother and children.

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Come on, mother and everybody.

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then Macme deafening from Scooby-Doo.

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I had her too.

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Then hop on top of Charlie Brown's teacher.

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Walked from the front.

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
From behind it from beneath her.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But the ultimate kill that I've been craving is the hot brunette.

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Come on, mother and children.

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Come on, mother and children.

Come on, mother and children.

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Come on, mother and child.

Come on, mother and children.

100
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Come on, mother and children.

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Come on, mother and children.

102
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Come on, Mother and children.

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Come on, mother and children.

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Come on, mother and children.

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Come on, mother and children.

106
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Come on, mother and children.

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,600
a nice start to a memorial day, uh, bank holiday weekend to play a song like that, uh,

108
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,920
it's on YouTube. I'll put a link in the show notes. I, if it's not pod save yet, I really hope

109
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,560
it does go pod save. You gotta see it in context, uh, with the actual cartoons you're singing

110
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,600
about. Uh, so it's, uh, yeah, it's pretty much been three days of the same, uh, for this long weekend.

111
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,640
It's bank holiday here in the United Kingdom. It's Memorial Day weekend in the United States. I'm

112
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,040
not quite sure what it is in other countries, but it seems like every country has something

113
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,160
going on today. The Netherlands has, um, I believe a religious holiday called Pinkstudent,

114
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,680
no idea what that is, which is pretty atrocious actually. I've certainly celebrated the day when we

115
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,640
live there, taking the day off without knowing what it was about. Let me just open up the window

116
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,280
a little bit for you. I'm in the, uh, in the attic on the third floor, the curry manner, uh, get

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,960
another weekend at home, which was now I always feel guilty though when you have a Monday that's

118
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,280
a long weekend. I feel like I should be doing something, you know, not just lounging around, but it's

119
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,560
really tough not to with this weather we've had. And I think it's, everybody I know that had this weekend,

120
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,120
you had great stuff planned. And of course, we'd had some wonderful weather in the, in the past couple

121
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,960
weeks. And really, I think it just doused everyone, uh, formula one. See, did, uh, there was

122
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,800
chance of rain for formula one in Monaco. There was definitely rain at the Indy 500 in, uh, Indian

123
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,000
apolis. In fact, I, I don't even know who, who won yet because I had to just tune out. There was,

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,760
they were showing the last 20 races of last year's race. It was, so, so rained out and just,

125
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,520
it kept coming down. So I'm up here. I've got the, because it is significantly colder in the,

126
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,280
in the previous couple days. I've got the fire place on, uh, Cindy, uh, the cat that I found in the,

127
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,080
in the gas station trash. He's up here, sleeping away on the couch. And it's really, it's kind of

128
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,240
mellow. And I'm figuring, besides maybe the, uh, the sills at the beginning of the show, maybe,

129
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,360
uh, you know, just play a little bit of chill music, shoot the, shoot the bull. Uh, hopefully

130
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
most of the people who listen to show have the day off. Listen to that outside. Listen to that rain.

131
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Ooh, that's not thunder. That's, uh, that's the wind blowing against the second microphone. I

132
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,280
cleverly placed in front of the window to give you the impression that I'm sitting here. Well,

133
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,720
actually, I'm sitting here with the window open. Listen to what it does kind of have a nice vibe to it.

134
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,000
Anyway, I caught that video from, uh, self off of John DeVorex, uh, blog, John C. DeVorex blog. Yo,

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,960
Adam, trucker Tom here. John C. DeVorex, joining pod show. It'll never work. Just kidding.

136
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,360
Welcome John to, uh, pod show. I've enjoyed John's articles over the years and, uh,

137
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,520
glad to see him coming to pod show. You know, it's really been interesting since this news came out.

138
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:46,000
And I was listening to, uh, to twit, uh, which is this weekend, I guess is this weekend's episode.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,280
I think it went up today. And at the, and I saw I already saw on the show notes at the end of the show.

140
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,840
I listen to the entire show and indeed, near the end of the show, um, they talked about, uh,

141
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,720
John joining pod show. And I think John was a little bit surprised at, um, at the, uh, at the level of

142
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,200
joking that took place amongst this core group of, of twits. And I don't think he was entirely prepared for it.

143
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,880
It was pretty cool. He, you know, they, they kind of snowed him under. I liked it. He did a shitty job

144
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,320
of explaining what he's going to do, by the way. And, you know, what, what we did when John was on the

145
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,320
show, um, was it, uh, Thursday, you know, went through the press release and kind of smiled about how it

146
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,200
was written in all these fantastic quotes. And you know, that's exactly what, uh, what, what, what Leo

147
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,200
was doing is like, yeah, of course. You got to be prepared for that, man. You know, when you're with pod show,

148
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:45,680
you know, you, you, you're with the Death Star. He has no idea what's coming. He's going to wish

149
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,320
he had danger pay. And, you know, I've read all kinds of stuff around, uh, around the blogosphere

150
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,320
and the pod atmosphere, I've been hearing things. It's in blog posts, um, the, a very complimentary

151
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,120
thing. It's a great thing. Uh, the John is, is joining pod show. I don't think people really understand

152
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,440
why he's joining. And if you think it's for the money, then, well, you'd have to ask him about that.

153
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,120
Um, I think he wants to figure out how the Death Star works. I think it's some personal

154
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,400
satisfaction he wants to get. And he was on Twitter, which was great, because of course,

155
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,720
that was the entire deal. You know, if he, uh, he can continue with cranky geeks, if he wants,

156
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:30,160
um, which I, I encourage him, I really want him to do that. It's a great show. Um, he can, uh,

157
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,400
do Twitter, his, you know, the, the columns he writes, you know, the, hey, this is,

158
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,000
he's doing a certain number. We don't know him. He's asked forever. Like, and like anybody,

159
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,000
am I asked his own? Here's something funny, though. I'll see who sent me this. Um,

160
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,160
Brent, pod show radio. So I was watching Leo today on stick cam, stick cam, doing his live

161
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,120
KFI show. Okay. So I guess he has a, uh, a webcam in the studio while he's doing his, his radio show.

162
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,880
I did not get the entire conversation with Leo started out by saying, I'm not a big fan of pod show.

163
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,640
At that point, I thought, this might get interesting and started recording. What you are hearing is

164
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,320
Leo talking to someone during a commercial break, possibly as producer. So you'll only hear Leo's

165
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,920
part of the conversation. I've enclosed the recording. I think you might be interested in this.

166
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,960
And, and I, you know, I think that Leo is exactly this kind of guy. He's a sweetheart, you know,

167
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,920
and he'll put webcams and, and any, you know, live streams all around him and he'll, you know,

168
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,120
just put his life out there and with that comes stuff like this, which is pretty fun.

169
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,880
Greed if, if I asked him at any time, not to, you know, he said, I won't plug pod show at all.

170
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,560
You know, I don't need to plug pod show. So we'll just see, I mean, I, you know, I'm not going

171
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,920
to fire him. He's, you know, he's a critical part of Twitter. I might use him a little less.

172
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,240
What I'd love to do is find some replacements for him. There's nobody like him. I need to find,

173
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,320
I mean, he's got a great sense of humor. He's got a great pacing, you know, he understands bro.

174
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,520
I mean, I just hear what Leo says. This is so amazing. I need to find someone to talk

175
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,720
how to place him. He likes much form. There's nobody like him. I need to find somebody like him.

176
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,720
I mean, he's got a great sense of humor. He's got a great pacing, you know, he understands broad casting.

177
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,120
His knowledge, you know, is, is fantastic. And he's got this great well-known persona.

178
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,360
So it'd be very hard to replace John. Just like it'd be very hard to replace Merlin on Mac

179
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,720
Breakweekly. I mean, I think John or, you know, J.R. Youwing, you know, that's just when you have that.

180
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,240
And I agree with you, Leo. John's going to work has that. I was just watching the show on channel

181
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,640
four last night. Guy went out and interviewed different actors on Dallas and J.R. Youwing.

182
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,080
I mean, you got to hear that guy's story. He, when they shot J.R. He literally held out and said,

183
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,720
okay, well, you have two ways to go. Either you can replace me or you can change the story line.

184
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,120
But I'm not coming back until you let me do this, this and this, which included in essence,

185
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,880
a large part of control over the show. And he held out and he got it.

186
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,720
And why was I saying that? Oh, yeah. Because, you know, it's like some people just aren't replaceable.

187
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,320
Absolutely.

188
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,040
Agreed. Merlin have kind of the same roles on those podcasts. They're really the, the kind of the focus of the podcast.

189
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,080
Pixel Core is not competing because Pixel Core doesn't. I mean, they're a little bit competing,

190
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,960
but not really. They're, I don't know what he's talking about now about Pixel Core.

191
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,520
They're doing different, the fringes of the stuff we do.

192
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,280
What, my biggest fear of John would be competing if, you know, already he's competing with cranky geeks.

193
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,880
Cranky geeks is basically a video of twit. I don't worry about people doing video.

194
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,120
I don't think video competes with audio. I don't think that's fair to say either, you know.

195
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,320
Cranking geeks is not exactly a video of twit.

196
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,280
Well, unless you take into account that a lot of the vibe of the show is because of

197
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,960
John Devorek podcasting. But if John decided to do an audio

198
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,880
roundtable news podcast on pod show, that would be it. And then I might kind of feel like,

199
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,760
well, he's doing his own thing. You know, but Kevin started Dignation. I was unhappy about that,

200
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,800
but he's always welcome on Twitter. He does that turns out he doesn't come on ever.

201
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,000
Patrick's doing DLTV. That's more like the screen savers. I mean, everybody's got their own thing.

202
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,680
We don't have a deal with these people not to, you know, that they can't do their own thing.

203
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
I don't want to be in contract.

204
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,440
So I don't guess he's listening to the producer saying something because it's just a gap in this in this recording.

205
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,560
Well, there's lots of people who say get rid of Devorek. I would never, I love this.

206
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,960
Everyone should have one of these little hidden recorders in their house.

207
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,280
But this is, I don't think he's saying anything bad. This is fantastic. This is Leo being completely honest.

208
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,600
And the way I think he always is. If someone asked him this, he'd probably say it the same way.

209
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:03,040
Not sugar code. I'm not going to do that. I John and I go back way back. I mean, he got me my start in the tech.

210
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,320
So, all right.

211
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,360
And so then there's another

212
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,520
exactly tech girl. I don't pay these guys. I can't fire them.

213
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,880
I could use him less or Twitter using them not at all. I think he's important.

214
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,400
Yeah. All right. So that's kind of the end of it.

215
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,560
That was pretty cool. Listen in on the stick can.

216
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,880
All right. Keep that vibe going that I had with the fireplace and the cat make on the cat.

217
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:34,160
Oh, the growing light. I slow up and breath the sea.

218
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,720
Burn and ride, I can sense the heat. Deep inside.

219
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,520
Don't play with fire. I love her. He'd hate this more.

220
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,440
That's the aspercesome. I don't get too close.

221
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,600
It's taking me so far. It's just a joy to protect you.

222
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Yeah.

223
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,760
Tanks spoke with words that inspired the stars.

224
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:30,400
Wild winds spread of forest fog with hands so hot.

225
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,560
Give me the degree I can barely breathe.

226
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
Listen your heart on me.

227
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,280
Don't play with fire. I love her. He'd hate this more.

228
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,800
Wow. It's the aspercesome.

229
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,360
I don't get too close. It's taking me so far. It's just a joy to protect you.

230
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,920
And the pleasure. Love her. He'd hate this more.

231
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:07,920
It's the aspercesome. I don't get too close. It's taking me so far. It's just a joy to protect you.

232
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:40,800
Don't play with fire. I love her. He'd hate this more.

233
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,080
Wow. It's the aspercesome.

234
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:50,320
I don't get too close. It's taking me so far. It's just a joy to protect you.

235
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:57,040
And the pleasure. Love her. He'd hate this more.

236
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,880
It's the aspercesome. I don't get too close. It's taking me so far. It's just a joy to protect you.

237
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:10,400
It's the aspercesome. I don't get too close.

238
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,400
It's taking me so far. It's taking me so far. It's taking me so far.

239
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,240
It's taking me so far. It's taking me so far. It's taking me so far.

240
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:41,600
You know, it's not entirely perfect, but it's just something about it.

241
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,160
It works really. You can go to a page on the positive music network. Let me see.

242
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:54,800
I remember now. Yes. That's a Rachel Pearl. Don't play with fire here in Curie's Jell's cafe.

243
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,120
Just with Tennessee. She has a couple of very interesting songs. You check it out. Rachel Pearl.

244
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,480
Of course, a link to let me get the outsides back in there. Oh, shit. See, I got all my

245
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,800
production here. Trying to bring you into that mood. That's really what I intended to do for today's show.

246
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:18,160
Just talk a little bit. Play a couple of mellow songs. See how far we get while the rain just

247
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:27,200
keeps on pissing down literally. I was planning on perhaps even going off to Germany today or tomorrow,

248
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,840
but it seems like the entire world has just come to a grinding halt. I hope that by the time you

249
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,600
hear this, you're at least in a portion of the type of vibe that I've had for the past couple of days.

250
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,920
There's only one thing that I'm really bummed out about today. That's that I've promised myself

251
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,000
and really carry who is maintaining my schedule here at the UK crash pad, which I'm going to tomorrow.

252
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,720
I have to do the administration here at the manner. I've already started all the

253
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:07,120
bank statements, which I get so many bank statements. I hate that. The majority of them just call

254
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:14,480
an opened, but then the pile of stuff to do, there must be at least 50 envelopes and I'm

255
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:22,960
dreading that. I asked you like a... Speaking of Germany, a whole bunch of people responding to my

256
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
call is to, you know, what kind of what city should we take a look at? And I think that in general,

257
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:34,400
it's come down to Cologne, Cone, as they would say, or Hamburg, and a lot of great response.

258
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,880
Seriously, and here's an example of one. Hi there, and it's Mark from Hamburg Germany,

259
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,280
good to hear that Pacho is coming to Germany, and hey, of course, you'll be choosing Hamburg.

260
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,080
Hamburg is a beautiful city with already music scene, we have lots of water, and of course, we have

261
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,960
Hamburg International Airport that's 25 minutes from downtown, and we have a couple of smaller

262
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,280
airports around. So, come on over, check it out, it's Mark from Hamburg plus 49. Okay. All right, Mark,

263
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,560
see, that's what I mean, that's extremely cool, and I'd be getting so, so many of those,

264
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,600
and suggestions and podcasts that, of course, I've never stumbled upon yet, you know, and I'm

265
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,880
learning the landscape, and I also do have to get back to San Francisco, though, it's just like,

266
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:22,160
so much to do. There's a lot of stuff that comes from Germany, and in fact, one of the original

267
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,480
Mac Datties of the Podsafe Music Movement comes from Germany. Do you know that? Can you guess

268
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:39,920
who it is? I mean, his stuff has been around for a long time, and on the network, some of his

269
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:52,400
stuff is performed by Mario Agiero, and you probably recognize this. This is the, the Moonlight

270
00:20:52,400 --> 00:21:00,400
piano sonata of the 27 number two movement one from Ludwig van Beethoven, a fine upstanding

271
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:10,880
Podsafe, German citizen.

272
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:10,960
Now, bad, huh? Especially when you consider a man Ludwig van Beethoven through that one down

273
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,320
over 200 years ago. I don't care why you say any song that's being played more than 200

274
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,120
years after it's been released, you know, there's something going on there. It's just, I think

275
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,280
about these classical songs, that was long. I was like six minutes, it doesn't fit into my,

276
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:33,360
you know, my three to four minute format, but we've morphed into. But of course, he would have been

277
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,120
happy to know that listening to this on an iPod or in a web browser or almost anything you're

278
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,760
listening to it on, you could just fast forward through the boring bits. I wonder if he would have

279
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,400
minded, and by the way, for those of you that think that he's from Austria, he moved to Austria

280
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,800
when he was around 20, but he was born in, I think was born in, he born in Bonne, another candidate

281
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,840
for Partio HQ. Hey Adam, this is Chris Mahquard from Germany, host of tips on the top floor and

282
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,680
a proud member of the Partio family, and I hear you talk a lot about Darmstadt recently, so it sounds

283
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,680
very interesting to me, and I'm really looking forward to all the news that you're going to bring

284
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,240
home around that. I'm also an active podcaster in Germany for the German market, so

285
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:21,120
we might want to talk about a few things here. I've also just released my show number 200 of tips

286
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,160
on the top floor, if you want to see Drucker Tom as an alien, Don and Drew Dancing,

287
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:32,320
CC Japanese singing, and of course the Jeff Smith who wrote the theme song for the show,

288
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,120
then yeah, go and over to tips from the top floor.com, lots of photography tips in that show as

289
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,440
well, and by the way, I'm not even going to go into what Darmstadt actually translates to.

290
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,360
Anyway, didn't I only translate this? I know. Oh, I did.

291
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,560
I think I played that, you know, I'm fried, man. Did I play that on Friday? Like an idiot, I'm

292
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,840
rolling it. I doesn't matter. Crab, I know this one didn't go out on Friday.

293
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:08,800
Hello, Mr. Adam Curry. I've just been to the Partio Sutlus Zone. I finished the survey, and I'm

294
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:15,200
pretty pissed off because I think Partio is beautiful. I love what you guys are doing. I love the fact

295
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,440
that you will host my podcast for free and you can put your ads in and whatever I don't care,

296
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,960
but, you know, these are doing a great service. But the main problem that I find with the Partio

297
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,120
site is that it's very complicated. It's cluttered. And I think it needs to be nice. So here I go

298
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,400
into the survey and I'm answering all these questions. And that ones you talk about the design

299
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,760
so come on guys, you got to get into a six-glistan design, make it easier, make it, you know,

300
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,600
let's cluttered. That's all I ask. Hey, hey! Yeah, I know! Now, obviously if you think that

301
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,480
this juncture where we have the sock-less zone and we're surveying as to how we can sock less,

302
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,960
if we didn't know that something needed to be fixed with design, we would have been in a very

303
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,760
sad state. So you'll see that there are a number of questions that have to do with the

304
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,320
functionality of the design and that's exactly what you're talking about. And of course we have

305
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,440
I mean, this is, there is a plan, believe it or not, there is an actual plan and people

306
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,800
say search sucks. That's right. New search being implemented across the board. So it's

307
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:25,680
things like that and it just takes time. But I do appreciate you for completing the survey

308
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,240
and I hope you'll continue to work with us just to help us suck less and get some real data

309
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,080
to the people who produce this stuff. I'm dying to know, I'm just dying to know what some

310
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,280
of the answers to this survey are. And everyone, you know, gets to everyone who participates,

311
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,720
particularly all the producers, what do you have? Like, I don't know how many we have. It's like

312
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,520
8,000 shows on the network or something like that. It doesn't matter, even if it's 80 or 80,

313
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,960
just getting that information is fantastic. So I really do appreciate it. And then I got this from

314
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:09,360
a couple of people. Sinclair was the most recent one who sent it in. No carmers and the CEO,

315
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:17,840
yeah, the CEO of Syria satellite, radio, who of course is trying to come together with XM to create

316
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,160
one big satellite monopoly. Make no mistake. That should, of course, never happen. These companies

317
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,440
probably should just go away. I mean, it just makes no sense to have, when I suppose to have

318
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,120
monopolies, this is not the way it works. There's probably too many, too many people who've got

319
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,440
options and shares in their pockets. So we'll see what happens there. It doesn't matter. No carmers

320
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:48,960
and said, well, it's about to talk about the stock prices versus value. Each of these companies

321
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:58,240
I think loses $600 million per half here. It's just an amazing amount of money. But he said,

322
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,800
no, well, we suck less than XM. That can't be a mistake. That can't be a coincidence,

323
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,280
either. It's not. And if you think that big media isn't listening to what, not just what

324
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Pod chose doing, but to what we all collectively are doing, you're making a mistake. Of course,

325
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,800
they are. Of course they're listening. They're not stupid. And of course, they've heard that

326
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:25,280
fricking suck less. So many times. I think a attention, Jeff Smith, we're going to need some,

327
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,520
let's do a country version. Let's do a hip hop version. We already have different podcasts

328
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,160
with doing, we've got to do some shorter versions because I will have to shoot myself. Or at least

329
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,360
until we get, you know, like 7,000 people who said, let's do that. Yeah, we could always turn the

330
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,520
suck less zone around. We won't turn off the suck less sawing until, until you've all taken the

331
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,520
survey. Post the name of that movie. It was some horror movie. Was that, or Friday the 13th or

332
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:59,280
Nor was Halloween. It was some kind of thing that kids had. It was a wristband or a toy.

333
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,160
And you'd hear the song on television. Nine more days, tailhandle, a wean, something like,

334
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,520
what the hell was the name of that movie? Kind of helped me out. This fine team is quality.

335
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:15,280
So actually, the art of music is the art of speaking with this fine team is quality.

336
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,820
Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

337
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,060
Wow.

338
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,520
It's like 1 in one, and you put it around and Defce your.
