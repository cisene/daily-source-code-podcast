1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You better be careful out there on the next couple of weeks you hear me?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's close the room.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
No.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Two sides.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Soon or later, either you're gonna be with us.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I can be with the nearest one family.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
All the places you gotta come to my place.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm done with you!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Walking Phoenix, Mark Wahlberg,

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
on October 12th.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, get down!

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Two brothers collide.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Maybe you could be killed.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Right?

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Right?

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We own the night rated R.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Once again, it's time to ask.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Where in the world is Adam Curry?

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Perhaps we'll find out on the DSC 667.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Been the next generation radio content in my ears.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I like to think I'm strong.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, David.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm Curry.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Do you name it?

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What's up?

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Get it?

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Can you see it all over my face?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Uh-huh.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I try to hide it.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But I kept it in the cupboard in case.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Case I liked it.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I got a green light.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm glad we had the party in your place.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh yeah.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It did feel right.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Turning back to Amber Red Light.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Red Light spells a danger.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Maybe you name it?

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Maybe you name it?

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Maybe you name it?

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Maybe you name it?

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Maybe you name it?

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Maybe you name it?

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
TVC's on the team.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe I can't TV.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Lady Trump.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Lady Trump.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
How can make your baby cry?

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If you killed FDP.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Baba D's and most MPs.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Me.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm on the K.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The street.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Maybe you name it?

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Maybe you name it?

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You name it?

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You name it?

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You name it?

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Desit on the ceiling.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Desit on the floor.

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You name it like it.

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
More and more more and more more more more more.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:23,880
You made me like it. They are from a thing Scotland. Everybody how you're doing it.

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,880
It's a daily source code episode 667 and I don't know where you are. You may be just waking

69
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,560
up Saturday morning at the podcast media. It is officially now the podcast media expo. I believe

70
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:46,040
hold on. I'm trying to get my sound right here. I'm set up in the hotel room and boy, it was

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:53,800
last time we spoke on Tuesday. Oh fantastic. Another two-show week. Fuck. It's really frustrating.

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,240
There's been a lot going on and I have been taken notes so I can bring you up to speed.

73
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,040
First, I'll tell you about the setup here. It's a very interesting hotel. We're in the

74
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,080
in the Sheraton, the Marriott, which is closer to the actual convention center and a lot of the

75
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,920
action is booked up fully, well in advance. I'm sure. Of course, I only knew last minute that I was

76
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:22,360
going to come out here. There's actually this is like a round glass dinner table in my sweet here

77
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:29,800
on the non-smoking floor. We almost got everything right for Adam with the bookings except for the

78
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,040
non-smoking floor because you know when I come out to the to the to the expo or anywhere that

79
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,720
there's people who listen to the show. Man, I get hooked up left and right and I deserve it. It's the

80
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,800
end of the of a long week and it's going to be this way for I told you up until the new year. It's

81
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,720
really the time to hustle and move ass and get some shit done. My week started Wednesday morning

82
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:01,000
flying to Chicago. Great flight, you know, took Virgin Atlantic and it was beautiful as always. I must

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,520
say though, I'm not quite sure if someone was trying to do me a favor or what was going on but

84
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,400
when I got off the plane it'll hair. They made an announcement would you please have your

85
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,160
your passports out and ready because you know instead of you normally expect to go through

86
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,920
customs right and there's a line etc and all that and then there's a non-residents and residents and

87
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,400
so but right at the end of the jet way we had to show our passports and I showed mine and there's like

88
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,200
four homeland security agents and lady took my passport to say oh yep here you go and she gave it

89
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,600
some other guy some forgot his name agent something or other and he said come with me and so you know

90
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,200
it's like all right and so we're we're you know we go around through a secret door and

91
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,320
I don't have to stand in the queue or anything like that and then he waits for me to get my bag and

92
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,600
I'm like is it's a hookup from Virgin you know what what is this like VIP treatment like

93
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,000
and it was I guess not having to stand in line but then he said you know because you know

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,960
of me taking you through here I got to open up your suitcase and so then he proceeds to open

95
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:15,000
everything up and he asked all kinds of questions about you know my you K address my address in San Francisco

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,320
and I don't know luckily I wasn't carrying any contraband my goodness I'm so lucky

97
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:30,360
anyway Chicago I was there to speak in front of about 250 300 people at OMD which is

98
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,560
probably the world's largest digital agency and Pachod does plenty of business with them

99
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,120
and I'm always looking for more you know me mr. opportunist so I did a keynote

100
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,720
which is fun you know it's a man I I wish I was a video of the one I did at IMedia because I think

101
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,400
you'd really enjoy it I think that there might be one that was made so if that becomes available I'll

102
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,760
be sure to put it up online man it looks like my levels are a little low here hold on let me just

103
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,400
crank up the mic a little bit how's this and my more in your ear now is that better

104
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,200
then in the so I did the keynote in the morning and it was it was a little bit messed up because

105
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,080
when I got to Chicago I called Patricia and she really was feeling poorly and that really sucks you know

106
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,040
I was like fuck I left again and now you know she's not feeling well she's okay but she just you know

107
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,920
just not feeling just over tired I think from a number of things and also Christine is back in school

108
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,560
so we're all getting up really early again my wife she flourishes beautifully in spring and summer

109
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,960
and in winter time she really cold weather just does not agree with her as long as I've known her you know

110
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,560
she really goes into hibernation mode and around January she starts to freak out and she really

111
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,920
needs the weather to get warmer that's usually when we book our trips to Jamaica

112
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,800
anyway so did the keynote and then there was a panel moderated by cool guy Nick Johnson

113
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,680
who I think he said he's like head sales Weasel over at mbc.com

114
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,200
smart guy and so you know as a panel of me and a guy from Google got from Microsoft guy from my space

115
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:17,800
another woman from mbc.com and between her and Nick I was like man you know either

116
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:25,400
either you guys coming to work with me or I'm gonna you know we have to buy nbc

117
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:37,720
those are smart people and so it was cool and so thanks to Sean Finigan Bill Gorsky and above

118
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:46,280
all Cory oh man I hadn't met Cory Cory I don't know she she's like some head hunch over there but

119
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,920
kind of she probably hate me for saying but she kind of looked like like Tina Fey you know I

120
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,000
considered to be extremely beautiful and she yes she really had a Tina Fey look which she was five

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,200
months pregnant and wow she was just incredibly sexy she had me mesmerized throughout this entire event

122
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,320
she was running around and then taking care of business it was awesome totally lover anyway so jump

123
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:17,960
on jump after literally ran right off the panel into a waiting automobile and sped off at about 15

124
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,920
miles an hour to oh hair airport it was bumper to bumper traffic all the way so just barely made it

125
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:30,600
onto the flight TSA no problem for me at least this time of course I didn't have any hair products

126
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,840
in my bag I did have the usual transmitters microphones wires all kinds of devices multiple cell

127
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,280
phones lighters you know all of that stuff that of course is completely safe and they're not looking for

128
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:52,680
we'll talk more about that later and a sat next to and actually usually I you know I fly a coach

129
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,760
when I'm flying internally in the US I like jet blue a lot as you know and I've tried out virgin

130
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,440
and so this was american airlines I think someone must have used their miles or something but they

131
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,240
hooked me up with a first class seat which was nice I wouldn't have made that much difference it's

132
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,880
short flight you know four hours not that bad set next it's lovely woman who and I said she she

133
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:21,080
she looked like mid 50s probably and you were talking about TSA she said oh tell me about it you

134
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:28,280
know I have a pacemaker and she says you do really think that that having TSA feel me up

135
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,240
every single time I go through the metal detectors can make your flight any safer as you just

136
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,800
the lovely woman lovely nice chat was one of those you know it wasn't an uncomfortable type of

137
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:47,720
seatmate chat it was it was nice it kind of felt good and and then upon arrival at John Wayne Airport

138
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,440
Orange County California had yet another escalate with tinted windows waiting for me to whisk me

139
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:02,440
away to the Sheraton hotel in lovely Ontario California and we had our traditional

140
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:11,640
unexpo party going on which we did with the extreme pods and rumour girls and yeah those are the

141
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,640
main the main sponsors I think we took care of all the drinks which was basically you know that's

142
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,560
all you need here is you just need some drinks and a room and we're good to go and it was packed it was

143
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:30,920
absolutely packed and it was just amazing to to see everybody oh man I can't remember

144
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,360
although I must say I've gotten much better at recognizing the faces now that I've seen them a couple

145
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:43,640
times in a row or you know I've seen them in the past the previous events and just getting to know

146
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,560
people more women this year because you know this is totally a middle-aged white guy geek fest to be

147
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,840
quite honest I'm not even sure what we're doing here other than to absolutely hang out with each other

148
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:01,720
and that's working that's totally working for me but it's so good to see women here and so of course

149
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:09,880
Angie B and God she's such a she's a flirt man she drives me nuts and I got my big hug and she

150
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,840
gave me a big kiss on the lips and you know her lips were really sticky and uh to my

151
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:21,000
one like sticking together I could barely talk some kind of lip gloss thing I hope and pizza babe

152
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,240
as she kept hugging me Marcus couches wife you know she's so lovely and there were some of the

153
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,480

165
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,240
moments in what knots girls from the soundtrack to my life thanks to the organization for the

166
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,160
preservation of said soundtrack to my life we're able to play that on a fubar Friday I do have

167
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,440
kind of maximum music for you but there's a lot of there's a couple topics I do want to run through

168
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:13,080
but just finishing up you know being being here so the party was was fantastic and it was great

169
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:19,320
because security and the cops came to shut us down just before everything got out of control

170
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:25,640
and the booze was pretty much done by that time as well so that was outstanding I would have to say

171
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:33,320
a very proud of our pod show a presence here to kick off of the festivities at the portable

172
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,960
media xways I guess it is officially podcast and the new media expo

173
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,520
so then it was pretty early 12 12 o'clock I was back in my room you know

174
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,640
tried to do a little bit of email of course bandwidth is horrible at a convention like this

175
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,520
that is not really sitting at the hotels everything aren't set up for oh shit no hotel is set up

176
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,840
for the amount of bandwidth we're consuming that's for sure so got some sleep you know of course

177
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:07,400
I woke up at five woke up at six woke up again at eight and then London was up so they started

178
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,240
calling so long after I get so got up and basically had my double coffee breakfast

179
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,280
didn't even have time to order room service just one after another and yeah some meetings were

180
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,440
started to go on of course so we have the digital musical awards on Tuesday so that's why I'm flying

181
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:34,520
back tomorrow Saturday afternoon I'm flying back for a rival Sunday this is big and and this is

182
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,320
going to be the debut although it's kind of running already of the plus yeah this is original

183
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:47,160
higher I'm trying to watch the plus TV and an EVDO connection here and you might imagine

184
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,400
it's just not cutting and now it's wanting if there's any kind of adjustments that I can make

185
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,400
to this on my end so that maybe of a lesser quality so that I haven't been with trying to

186
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:05,640
watch on this wireless connection the idea is it'd be appreciated for the show yeah yeah man

187
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,440
so first of all you know your results are gonna be I'm gonna very for sure when you're trying to

188
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:18,360
do is stuff like that over EVDO now this is of course this is all pretty new to us and just to be

189
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,480
on the very safe side and we went with a really safe solution for the stream of course I know

190
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,600
we can do flash etc we've tried that in the past it wasn't great for everybody so we're going

191
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:36,600
with really just a very very safe solution right now which is well Windows media and that's being

192
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:43,720
distributed by I'm so that's you know that's a pretty safe pretty safe bet there I believe the

193
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,520
stream is only like 348 kilobits and I don't know if it's variable I thought that you would

194
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,120
be able to connect at a lower speed you might have to check the settings on your player

195
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,640
to tell it to vary according to bandwidth or something like that but I don't know if if we

196
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,760
have to do something on our end it's entirely possible that we do but again your EVDO that's kind

197
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,600
of tough a lot of talk about the plus TV which I'm very happy about because you know I've mentioned

198
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,080
it here and there but I've been working on this for nine or ten months and it really started

199
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,960
with just a plan I wrote up on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon and you know the idea here is

200
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:24,600
imagine what MTV would look like if if it were still on its original mission here today

201
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:32,120
in the the age of YouTube and and episodic content so yeah there'd be music videos but we'd have

202
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,320
some you know some wacky stuff like people shooting bottle rockets out of their ass and you know

203
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,480
why wouldn't you have you know five minutes of texture really a complete kind of channel just

204
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,240
in linear fashion and you know we we have the machinery to do it all we just really needed to

205
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,520
away to schedule it so I found this great scheduling software and we work with the company to

206
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:00,520
modify it so it's really meant for radio stations and so you know this is not like a playlist that

207
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,600
you put into Windows media player and where you wait for the next thing to buffer it's one continuous

208
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,560
stream and we have a lower third titles that come up automatically and you can see we're doing

209
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,960
stuff on the page where it shows you what's coming up next and it's all kind of stuff like that

210
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,120
so it's really been fun at least the errands has been running this all by herself man it's been

211
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:25,800
a herkulean effort so we're gonna utilize that for our live coverage or our coverage of

212
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,440
the digital music awards and it starts on Monday so Monday we start with all our pre-stuff and we've

213
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:40,200
got lots of recognizable pod show faces who are doing segments and introwing all this stuff and

214
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,120
that will be looking at videos from the nominees and stuff about the event itself and it's going

215
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:53,080
to be pod show style you know so I think it should be pretty cool let's see so anyway yes so

216
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,840
I met with you know doing some meetings with the folks on our network which is really one of the

217
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,240
main reasons for me to be here and then there was the awards the pod cast awards and I think

218
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,760
well I know the show girls won for best general pod cast whatever that means so I wanted to go

219
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:15,960
and you know clap and cheer for him and it was really weird because they're not doing it at the hotel

220
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,240
this year they're doing it at the convention center itself and the room is so big it's like an

221
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,600
airplane hanger but like a really really big one and this is bigger than wing commander Williams

222
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,480
thing it would probably fit in that three times it's just huge and even though they had a stage

223
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,640
they you know they had a couple lights set up and a backdrop and they were doing the awards there

224
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,440
and the sound was kind of shitty because it was hard to fill the room without booming and echoing

225
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,680
and just not not great acoustics and just weren't enough people in there to fill it up I mean

226
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,520
you need five times the amount of people and there were hundreds at least it was more like a photo

227
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:56,680
off you know it was it was weird it you know when you say a award show I'm like I want a red carpet you

228
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,400
know I want some fanfare I want an acceptance speech you know that's what you I want

229
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,560
fucking Joan Rivers to be there to create to critique when I'm wearing you know I was ready

230
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:14,280
it wasn't there anyway hooked up with the dawn and drew I love those two they came back to the

231
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,160
room here and we did an episode of the dawn and drew show which was fun I had never done that

232
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,680
with them before and we had a good time it was definitely a blast so I'm a little bit drained from the

233
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:33,480
entire experience but I'm as I said I'm here I'm having a good time I've got a skip G said

234
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:40,280
I bumped into him he gave me a USB powered lava lamp which I have right here on the table I'm

263
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,280
floor flat out in portrayal hill fairly tall enough to peer over the window sill and I can still

264
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,000
remember how I feel to ride my new big wheel what big enough to push it up the hill before I

265
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,960
knew the value of a dollar bill I was shung it wide out of roads and tie that's funny how

266

time flies and you don't even notice for your mama sick on the school help notice before I ever

It's such a long, long time.

298
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,980
Guazan featuring Asia.

299
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,360
Remember, thanks to the hood hype brothers?

300
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,200
Nice, guys.

301
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,240
Thank you very much, it's beautiful.

302
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,240
I agree. I think the audience of this program will be somewhat turned on by

303
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:21,740
Nice sort of the M. It's kind of a weird Friday. It feels like 5 a.m. on Saturday.

304
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:27,740
Away to minute. That's what my body feels. Yeah, it's 930 p.m. here in Ontario, California.

305
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:37,740
And of course, 665 and 666 we talked about as I'd guys the movie and what people mistakenly

306
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:43,740
call my conspiracy theories on any conspiracy. I'm just following the money. I'm just looking

307
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,740
for just looking at, looking at for me, looking at for you, you know?

308
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:54,740
This is Tony and Haskell North Carolina. And I just wanted to thank you for bringing up the subject of the

309
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,740
zeitgeist movie. I had not seen that and found it very interesting. I've been wanting to

310
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,740
present it to other people that I know, but I think that the first part of the film with Haskell

311
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:10,740
really just slammed on it. A lot of people were not turned off and not wanting to continue watching it.

312
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,740
I've been introduced to these ideas, the conspiracy ideas. I think 30 years ago when I was

313
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,740
a teenager, I wasn't that old. And I kind of put it aside over 30 years, but I've

314
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:25,740
pulled it back to the, to the red bill moment that I think most of it's pretty accurate.

315
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:31,740
And I appreciate your perspective and I hope you've got to continue with your red bill

316
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,740
on the film subject. Anyways, thank you very much. Bye bye.

317
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:41,740
You know, so a couple things, first of all, yeah, I can understand where the religious

318
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:47,740
start of zeitgeist the movie zeitgeist the movie.com. I can understand where that is,

319
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,740
that might spark, I think they put it in there intentionally to also kind of titulate

320
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,740
and get people riled up and then maybe you're a little bit, maybe you're a little more susceptible

321
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:02,740
to information when you're emotional, which is how commercials work by the way, you know,

322
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,740
emotional, emotion could be happy, could be sad, could be angry, could be frightened,

323
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,740
and then the minute you're in your emotion mode, you can slip in all kinds of information

324
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:18,740
into people's heads. It's brain hacking. The other thing I noticed is, listen to Skyman.

325
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,740
This is awesome. You could totally be Elvis.

326
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:28,740
I appreciate your perspective and I hope you've got to continue with your red bill on the film

327
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,740
subject. Anyways, thank you very much.

328
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,740
Thank you very much. Do you hear that?

329
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,740
Maybe it is Elvis. How was could be out there listening?

330
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,740
Well, there are people who disagree, of course.

331
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:46,740
Adam, come on. I'm so sick of you being with this conspiracy bullshit. It sucks bullshit.

332
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,740
It is such bullshit.

333
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:58,740
They did not blow up the building. I'm so sick of everybody, but these conspiracy theories

334
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:05,740
and, ah, every podcast you talk about, they blew up the building. Come on.

335
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,740
You're smarter than that.

336
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,740
Oh, man.

337
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,740
It's all right, my brother. I know you're in a blue pill moment. It's okay. I love you.

338
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,740
Those of us swallowing the red pill love you severely.

339
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:27,740
Hey, hey, this is John from Dallas. First off, episode 66 Iron Maiden.

340
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:33,740
That's the soundtrack to my life right there, but I like what John does with the hit test,

341
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,740
but it's really a lot of dance music and stuff that I don't normally listen to.

342
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:44,740
So, hearing something like Bruce screaming on your show, nice, nice stage.

343
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:51,740
Second thing, all the stuff about these zeitgeist movie and the conspiracy theories and all that stuff.

344
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,740
Okay, I think listening to some of this, I think the truth actually somewhere in the middle.

345
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,740
I think they, because zeitgeist boys kind of went a little overboard with that whole chip thing.

346
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:07,740
But as far as following the money to find out what's really going on, yeah, that's definitely a valid idea.

347
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:14,740
I think anybody that has a pulse that can think for themselves in any way whatsoever,

348
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:21,740
can pretty well figure out that the crap we were told about the whole Iraq war doesn't add up.

349
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:34,740
And there's another reason behind it, and we don't know what it is because, you know, they just want to keep us stirred up about, you know, muslims and terrorism and all this crap in the real reason.

350
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:42,740
Is, is hidden underneath all that and trying to just be interested in getting a little discussion going about, you know,

351
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:48,740
I think we need to go stuff fires with the, you know, the one world order and the world government chips and all that crap.

352
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,740
I don't think, I think that's another smoke screen.

353
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:58,740
But what's really going on here, you know, I just kind of got me thinking about some things and really appreciate you picking it up.

354
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,740
All right, bro, talk to you later, man.

355
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,740
No, man, no, absolutely sanity there in the middle. Thank you. Very nice.

356
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:14,740
You know, and this is not, I play a game with Patricia all the time because she's, you know, she hears me, she hears me talking and she says,

357
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,740
Now I told you what she's, what she thought about Iraq, she said, now that was just something, you know, that was just,

358
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:24,740
Oh, no, actually 911. So that was something between the Bush family and the bin Laden family.

359
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:29,740
Something fucked up there. She said, that's just families, you know, who don't give a shit,

360
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:37,740
playing out their anger. And I trust my wife's opinion and viewpoint a lot of stuff and sometimes all things being equal,

361
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,740
the simplest answer could probably well be the truth.

362
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:50,740
So, but the game I play is just work backwards, okay. So, you know, we were in Iraq, why?

363
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:56,740
Well, was it because of September 11th? Well, no, because that was a sum of bin Laden.

364
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,740
All right, so you can already start asking questions there.

365
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:08,740
You know, some of the, what I would say is pretty good proof Alan Greenspan said, we were there for oil, okay. Why were there for oil?

366
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,740
Well, you know, now you start to ask questions again.

367
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,740
At every single step in this game is you work backwards.

368
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:21,740
You're going to have to answer certain questions and there's multiple paths you can take play it play it.

369
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:28,740
You know, so let's say why why did they go to Iraq? Well, because Saddam Hussein was a trouble maker, okay.

370
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:39,740
So, how did he become a trouble maker? Well, did we not support him as the US 10 years before that? Well, yeah, we did, you know, more questions to be asked.

371
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:47,740
I still recommend you go out and read Legacy of Ashes, the history of the CIA.

372
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,740
Tim Weiner, I think this is his name.

373
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,740
It's a good book. It's a tough one to get through, but I did finish it and it just shows you.

374
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:04,740
It just shows you how our government has worked for the past 30, 40 years with its clandestine operations.

375
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:11,740
And, you know, this is all the entire book is all from documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act,

376
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:18,740
and then the guys are reputable writers, so I'm going to have to presume it's done properly, or at least pretty close.

377
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:26,740
So that's all I'm doing, man. Just follow in the money, listen to the story, and I think we all just need to keep our eyes open.

378
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:38,740
And remember, if America really wants troops to be withdrawn from Iraq or anywhere, we should be able to make Congress do that.

379
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:45,740
I don't know if we're sitting around waiting for something to happen, but right now is not happening. So that's kind of weird.

380
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:51,740
You know what I'm saying? Are we exercising our rights properly? It doesn't feel like it.

381
00:39:51,740 --> 00:40:00,740
Maybe we're just not going about it the right way, but there's something messed up. It seems to me like everyone wants to withdraw or at least change something.

382
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:10,740
It seems like it's just not happening. It shouldn't be that way. There should be a way that our representatives take care of business.

383
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:15,740
Or maybe it's just not the majority of the country. That's what it kind of seems like.

384
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:21,740
And if you point on that, please, let me know. In fact, let me give you a phone number to call.

385
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,740
Gosh, I miss my equipment back home or at the condo. Nice compression.

386
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:40,740
4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 16, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3, plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 16, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.

387
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:45,740
Actually, John called back and had some choice words to kick off the next conversation.

388
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:50,740
AC, hey, John from Dallas again. I left off one thing in my last comment.

389
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,740
Scott thought the writing corpse of the TSA.

390
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:01,740
Dude, let me listen to that again.

391
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:07,740
Oh, I went down the wrong dude. Oh, listen to that.

392
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,740
What is it? This is in my last comment.

393
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,740
Scott thought the writing corpse. Dude, what?

394
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,740
Scott thought the writing corpse. Nice.

395
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,740
You remember the whole John Walker American Taliban incident two years ago?

396
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,740
Oh, you want to know fly list?

397
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,740
I have to be traveling on that day by air.

398
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:37,740
I have never in my life experienced the kinds of things that I experienced that day.

399
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,740
And I definitely gained a new appreciation and understanding for how a people still

400
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,740
being racially profiled or any kind of profile.

401
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,740
Living on the US, I've never experienced that before.

402
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,740
And it was a real eye opener.

403
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,740
And once again, fuck the TSA right in the fucking ass.

404
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:03,740
Wait a minute.

405
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,740
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

406
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,740
Anger is a beautiful thing, isn't it?

407
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,740
Hi, Adam. I'm Janice from New York.

408
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,740
Hey, John.

409
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,740
If you want to rail against the TSA and what doesn't make sense,

410
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,740
there are two things that you fail to mention.

411
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:22,740
One is always flying from Europe left summer and seem to me that you fly from Europe.

412
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,740
You don't have to take off your shoes.

413
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,740
It's kind of an American today.

414
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,740
Yeah, it's totally.

415
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:34,740
When I flew to Chicago, it was really busy at the take off your shoe line

416
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,740
because at Heathrow first you go through the metal detector and your bags go through.

417
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,740
And then you walk into, you know, they trap you into the fucking duty free area.

418
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,740
It's set up that way.

419
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,740
So you have to walk through the Dolce Gabbana crap.

420
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:51,740
And that's where they have their shoe x-ray, a separate shoe x-ray.

421
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,740
And it was busy.

422
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,740
There was a guy that just stands in, you know, you guys can just walk on by.

423
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,740
And he was like picking out, you know, where I thought was,

424
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,740
it doesn't look like a shoe bomber.

425
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,740
So you can just send that person off the left completely stupid.

426
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,740
Doesn't make a whole lot of sense since the shoe bomber was flying to the US

427
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,740
from Europe not the other way around.

428
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:15,740
I flew from Israel last summer and knew how security conscious Israel is.

429
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,740
Yeah.

430
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,740
I didn't have to take off my shoes.

431
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,740
So anyway, that's kind of ridiculous.

432
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,740
The other is, I'm a high school chemistry teacher.

433
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,740
And actually anyone who's taken high school chemistry probably can tell you that

434
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,740
if you want to blow something up, you don't need to live with.

435
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,740
Anyway, thanks for showing out of the fight.

436
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,740
Hey, Janice.

437
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,740
So first of all, you should call in more often.

438
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,740
You sound like a really hot chemistry teacher.

439
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,740
Man, I would have taken chemistry if you were my teacher.

440
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,740
You know, I'd be like, I miss Janice.

441
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,740
Could you just help me out with my experiment over here?

442
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,740
And then, you'd have to lean over me.

443
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,740
I'd feel your breath in my neck.

444
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,740
Ah.

445
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,740
Oh, if only it could be 15 again.

446
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,740
Um, alright.

447
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,740
Thank goodness there's a red pill on this whole TSA thing.

448
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,740
This is good.

449
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,740
Hey Adam, this is Sean J.

450
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,740
I'm having some honest issues.

451
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,740
I'm going to leave you as the same semester.

452
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,740
I'm instead of the long-winded one that you probably just waited for.

453
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,740
Yeah.

454
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,740
I did, by the way.

455
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,740
We're going to the whole security, airport security issue.

456
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,740
Something that has never really discussed that has been bugging me for a very long time.

457
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,740
It's almost right after September 11th.

458
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,740
Um, deals with that whole issue.

459
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,740
My wife is a flight attendant for Southwest Airlines, which is domestic.

460
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:41,740
So when things had happened, we didn't worry as much because our planes just

461
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,740
They didn't hold it up fuel.

462
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,740
They weren't going long haul.

463
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,740
The censored censors.

464
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,740
We weren't really worried about somebody taking a Southwest Airlines plane.

465
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:57,740
Um, but the thing that nobody talks about is that it would be impossible today to take over

466
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,740
an airplane with box cutters.

467
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,740
No matter how many people you had on the airplane.

468
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:08,740
Um, the reason that they were able to do it before September 11th is that nobody had ever used an airplane as a weapon.

469
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,740
Now, I want you to listen to this guy really closely.

470
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,740
He is so right.

471
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,740
See, he's so right.

472
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,740
Okay.

473
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,740
This was the big difference.

474
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,740
No one had used an airplane as a weapon.

475
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:28,740
That's very different from bringing weapons on board or trying to destroy an aircraft.

476
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,740
So listen to this.

477
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:30,740
This is really, this is good.

478
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,740
I'm so glad he brought this up.

479
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,740
He used an airplane as a weapon.

480
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:41,740
And, you know, the world protocol for terrorists on an airplane was to let them do their thing.

481
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,740
Let them land.

482
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:48,740
Uh, they would let people go eventually or, you know, worst case scenario kill everybody on the plane,

483
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:49,740
which is yeah, it's terrible.

484
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,740
But nobody would ever fly a plane into a building.

485
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,740
Well, that has changed.

486
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,740
In fact, it changed so quickly.

487
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:01,740
The attitude changed so quickly that during the attacks of September 11th, one of the planes

488
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,740
was not allowed to shoot the weapon.

489
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:12,740
So there's no way that, you know, regardless of my fingernail clippers, even a bomb on a plane is yet terrible

490
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,740
and you could blow up a lot of people.

491
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:21,740
But it's not going to have the terrorist effect of destroying something like a national monument or building.

492
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,740
Yeah, you know, I am so down with that.

493
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,740
I think you're so right.

494
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:31,740
Because after pan and 103, we didn't have all this fucking TSA crap.

495
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:39,740
You know, and that probably was the last really big American attack on American citizens

496
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,740
that brought a plane down.

497
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,740
And you're so right, you know, that was, in essence, that was pretty much a failed mission because

498
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,740
you know, you could take proper credit for it.

499
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,740
I know that sounds really crass, but it's true.

500
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,740
You know, we found out later that some Libyan guy had done it.

501
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,740
Maybe Codafi did it himself, doesn't matter.

502
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:03,740
You know, it's like, you know, no heroes there on that one.

503
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,740
No lasting point except for images.

504
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,740
So absolutely, that was the, you know, I had forgotten about this myself.

505
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,740
That was the big game changer, like holy crap.

506
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,740
Here we are.

507
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:20,740
We've been, you know, walking people through airport security, which, of course, was a joke before 9-11.

508
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:25,740
And, and here's some fucker who's so smart, just like learn how to fly a plane in Florida.

509
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:30,740
You know, yeah, okay, they had box cutters, whatever, but they overpowered the crew.

510
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,740
That's not that hard.

511
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,740
Pilots are usually pretty wimpy.

512
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:37,740
And, and then they use the pole plane as the weapon.

513
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,740
No need to smuggle anything on board.

514
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:44,740
Yet, all of this personal security stuff has gotten really tight.

515
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:54,740
And you could not, could not nowadays take over an airplane without heavy, heavy artillery, essentially.

516
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,740
You can't get into the cockpit.

517
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,740
People aren't going to let you take over a plane.

518
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:05,740
And, to even search us and go through the whole thing, if you think about going through security,

519
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,740
imagine what you would feel like.

520
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:13,740
It's actually currently, I think, an active terrorism in itself.

521
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,740
Imagine what you would feel like going through security if you just have to walk through.

522
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,740
You know, put your change in the bucket and walk through and then scan your bag.

523
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,740
You know, you don't have to take out your laptop.

524
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:29,740
You know, imagine how smoothly and happy you would feel getting on an airplane.

525
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,740
Just walking through that, you're not going to worry about the airplane blowing up.

526
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,740
We never did before in airplanes blew up.

527
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,740
No.

528
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,740
People are not going to be able to use airplanes as weapons.

529
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,740
And that nobody talks about that anymore because we have to stay scared, I guess.

530
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,740
Yeah.

531
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,740
And it's really frustrating to hear all this.

532
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:51,740
When there's no way that it's, I just don't think that it's possible.

533
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:56,740
I knew if I'm going to have kind of been upset about from day one that people never.

534
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,740
Yeah, shit.

535
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,740
Then you ran out of time.

536
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,740
That was three minutes.

537
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,740
But that was one of the best three minutes I've heard in a long time on this program.

538
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,740
Thank you, my friend.

539
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,740
You're so right.

540
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,740
Red pill within the red pill.

541
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,740
You nailed it, man.

542
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,740
You totally nailed it.

543
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,740
That's it.

544
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,740
It's that simple.

545
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,740
You know, this has nothing to do with 9-11.

546
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,740
And yeah, I've heard all the threats.

547
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,740
But nothing has really happened in that fashion.

548
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,740
So maybe that's because of the security.

549
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:25,740
I don't know.

550
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,740
But I just like some consistency.

551
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,740
Yeah.

552
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,740
I mean, I can think of a million scenarios.

553
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,740
Dude, you can get a boat.

554
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:34,740
And you can get out in near JFK.

555
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,740
You can get out on the lake.

556
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,740
And you're too into fucking stinger.

557
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:41,740
Missile any aircraft at any time.

558
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,740
You know, let's open our eyes up just a little bit.

559
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,740
So while that was playing, I was surfing around.

560
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,740
I was thinking of playing, of winding up today's show with

561
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:52,740
the dead pennede's moon-over-main, which is on the

562
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,740
Podsight music network now.

563
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,740
But I'm in a different kind of mood.

564
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,740
Here's something that I had not played in a long time.

565
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,740
Typically, I played this song, or I've played this song

566
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:07,580
I've played this song when I leave somewhere, when I leave a, when I've left radio stations

567
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:14,580
or left a country, and it's not particularly a happier sad song, it's just something

568
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:24,060
from the soundtrack to my life, and it's, I don't know, maybe it's because of the camaraderie

569
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:28,740
that I'm feeling right now with the sort of the tribute to some friends of mine.

570
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,740
God, I love this, this is so good.

571
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:36,740
This is Jackson Brown with a loadout. Enjoy, it's long, but you'll dig it.

572
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:23,740
Now the seats are on empty, let the road east take us to, pack it up and tear it down.

573
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:39,740
The first to come, and the last to me, working for that little way, there'll sit up in another town.

574
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:52,740
Tonight the people were still alive, they waited in their mind, when they got up on the feet

575
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:57,740
and made the show.

576
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:06,740
And that was sweet, but I can hear a sound of swimming doors and full of cheers,

577
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:14,740
that the sound they'll never know.

578
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:19,740
Roll them cases out of them if they're mixed,

579
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,740
and haul them trussers down and get them up their ramps.

580
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:31,740
Just when it comes to moving me, you know you guys are the chance,

581
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:40,740
but when the last guitar's been packed away, you know that I still want to play.

582
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:50,740
So just make sure you got all set to go before you come from my piano.

583
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:34,740
But the bands on the bus, and they're waiting to go, got it dry all night,

584
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:44,740
and do the shopping to cargo, or to train, and I don't know.

585
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:54,740
With their soul many shows and low, and these towns all look the same.

586
00:53:54,740 --> 00:54:02,740
We're just past the time in little hotels, and wander around backstage,

587
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:12,740
to those nights come up, and we hear that crowd, and they remember why we came.

588
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,740
I figured out why I went to the song, to be shared with you,

589
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,740
because it's my life right now.

590
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:46,740
I've got to do that show in Chicago, it is my life, now we got it.

591
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:56,740
Country and Western, all the buss, all the way, we got this room.

592
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:03,740
It attracts me, because that's the studio.

593
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:11,740
We've got a rural season magazine, and we've got truckers on C.P.

594
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:17,740
And we got a rich and prior on the video.

595
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:25,740
Time to think of the ones we love, while the miles go away.

596
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:34,740
The only time that seems too short, is the time that we get to play.

597
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:43,740
If you've got the power of what we do, you can sit there and wait for you to throw us through.

598
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:52,740
Come along, sing the song, you know that you can go around,

599
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:57,740
because when the Lord and Son comes speaking down,

600
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:01,740
you're on a wake-up in your town,

601
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:06,740
the bill is scheduled to appear.

602
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:14,740
A thousand miles away from here, people stay.

603
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:19,740
Still a little bit longer.

604
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:30,740
But we won't play in just a little bit longer.

605
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:34,740
What if don't mind?

606
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:39,740
And if you don't mind?

607
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:44,740
If you take a little time, and if you do all the hasn't,

608
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:51,740
why most are all what you stay?

609
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:57,740
Just a little bit longer.

610
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:07,740
Please, please, please, say you well, say you well.

611
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:27,740
Oh, what do you think?

612
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:32,740
Just a little bit longer.

613
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:42,740
Oh, what do you think?

614
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:47,740
Just a little bit longer.

615
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:52,740
Oh, what do you think?

616
00:57:52,740 --> 00:58:00,740
Just a little bit longer.

617
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:03,740
Oh, yeah.

618
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,740
I love this song.

619
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,740
And it's really about you.

620
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,740
You're listening.

621
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,740
Paul and we're going to touch you.

622
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,740
You're on the network.

623
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,740
We're an advertiser.

624
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,740
We're all connected in one way.

625
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,740
Some in many ways.

626
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,740
I love it.

627
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,740
Thank you.

628
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,740
I'm going to have a fun.

629
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,740
Remember, it's not a dress rehearsal.

630
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,740
It's a real deal.

631
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,740
All right, everybody.

632
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:38,740
I'll see you after the weekend when I'm back in there.

633
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,740
Foggy, hold the button.

634
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:44,740
And I'll buy now.

635
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,740
