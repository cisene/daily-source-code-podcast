00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,520
This year at Charlie, 5-2-Niner.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:41,880
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

7
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:11,960
It's time you get in the game, I can't fall asleep in this race.

8
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,400
It's no longer for me to be.

9
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:26,600
It's become routine, the better it's you.

10
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:37,640
It's somewhere in the world, where I don't rest, I don't have to deal.

11
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:46,840
Never be given, never be a song, I can move it through the back home.

12
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:06,600
It's time to try and get me in the back of my mind, and I just lose straight from time to time.

13
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:18,600
I'm worried that I can hold on me, but we'll all sign right on us back for free.

14
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:28,600
It's time you get in the game, I can't fall asleep in this race.

15
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:36,600
It's time to try and get me in the back of my mind, and I just lose straight from time to time.

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:52,600
It's time to try and get me in the back of my mind, and I just lose straight from time to time.

17
00:02:52,600 --> 00:03:00,600
It's time to try and get me in the back of my mind, and I just lose straight from time to time.

18
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:10,600
It's time to try and get me in the back of my mind, and I just lose straight from time to time.

19
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:18,600
It's time to try and get me in the back of my mind, and I just lose straight from time to time.

20
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:26,600
It's time to try and get me in the back of my mind, and I just lose straight from time to time.

21
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,600
It's time to try and get me in the back of my mind, and I just lose straight from time to time.

22
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Last week there was an email that was circulating the Potio mail servers.

23
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I think the title was vagrant effen records.

24
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,600
The lemon heads indeed are now on the Potio music network.

25
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Thanks to the label vagrant records, they put a whole bunch of stuff up there, including Paul Westerberg.

26
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,600
That was no back bone, and of course you'll find a link to that in the show notes.

27
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Hey everybody, how you doing?

28
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Daily source code episode number five to nine are coming to you from the Curry condo.

29
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,600
It's Sunday evening, and when I say evening, it's 10 minutes to seven, and I just had a great day.

30
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I was charged up.

31
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:16,600
We got up reasonably early for a weekend for me before nine o'clock, because we had a photo shoot going on at the office between 10 and 1230.

32
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I wanted to go over there and check out how it was going.

33
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
So it was beautiful outside today.

34
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
It was just a very nice.

35
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
The wind was calm.

36
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Oh for four bay area statistics.

37
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
I would say reasonably calm.

38
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Sun was out in shining.

39
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
It was just nice.

40
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:40,600
After the session was over, locked up the office, and I walked around a bit, went down to the water's edge.

41
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
And I got myself a sandwich and came back.

42
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
And I was, and there's a whole bunch of things we got to talk about.

43
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:58,600
But now that I have some version of connectivity and internet bandwidth in the condo temporarily, again, I'll get that in a second.

44
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,600
I was going through, you know, I had the computer open again, because without an internet connection, the computer is just useless.

45
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,600
It really is, unless it's a specific task you want to perform, but I'm always popping around.

46
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,600
And I forget about the net being even connected until you have to do something.

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
I think through voice mails, and I came across this one.

48
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Hi Adam is talking checking in.

49
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
From a rather grey, cold and miserable London.

50
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
So there you go, that's life.

51
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Just quick question.

52
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Where haven't you occurring some twin?

53
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I was really looking forward to that.

54
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
I appreciate an update.

55
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Check it.

56
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Bye.

57
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Thank you, parking.

58
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I don't even know.

59
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Did I play that on Friday?

60
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I might have.

61
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
So I remembered.

62
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
And it was, uh, or wasn't, you know, it was like two o'clock.

63
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
But a quick Gmail search, search for Leo Tweet.

64
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,600
And there was an email thread because we had gone back and forth on me joining on, uh, on Tweet.

65
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
He wanted to pay me 20 bucks.

66
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
I said, I, I do it for free.

67
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
As long as he kissed the ring.

68
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
And, um, so I sent him email, you know, I said, hey Leo, you know,

69
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,600
and this whole thread is probably seven or eight emails long.

70
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
And of course, Gmail nicely tracks that for me.

71
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,600
And it, uh, it didn't work out because every single time they,

72
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,600
they would be taping, it would be taped on Sunday around, uh, 11 30 p.m.

73
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Uh, UK time.

74
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:23,600
So, you know, I typically travel, uh, from San Francisco to London on Saturday arriving Sunday.

75
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
You know, I'm in the house around 12 noon.

76
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,600
And I just didn't think I would be coherent at all by that time.

77
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
So it didn't work out.

78
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
And I said, this is perfect.

79
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
They, oh, all set of an email.

80
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
And Leo said, yeah, man, no problem.

81
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Come on over.

82
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
So, um, Barkey, there's your answer.

83
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Uh, it's on the next episode of Twitter.

84
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
I think it'll be episode number 85.

85
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
And I gotta tell you, I really thoroughly enjoyed myself.

86
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
It was a nice conversation.

87
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,600
It was a lot about the technology news and stuff that I'm very interested in.

88
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,600
And it was, uh, it was just a good chat, you know, it wasn't an interview situation,

89
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,600
which is what I, what I despise most of the time.

90
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,600
When you go on these shows, this was just really, um, just a couple of geeks hanging out

91
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
talking on us on day after noon.

92
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
So, uh, be sure to check that out.

93
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
It may even be up by the time you see it.

94
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,600
So, as I have a, you know, connectivity and, and of course, having gone through that, you know,

95
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
you do, the creative juices are just flowing.

96
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
And, uh, and I'm, and I'm thinking about, I'm writing stuff down.

97
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Or this is going to talk about tomorrow.

98
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
This is going to talk about tomorrow.

99
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
So, you know, screw it.

100
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
I'm just going to do a show right now.

101
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Uh, and then I'll have all that extra time tomorrow morning.

102
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I can sleep in a little bit until like 7.

103
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
30 if I really want to.

104
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Uh, so, um, it may even be, um,

105
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Monday evening by the time you folks know Australia here, this.

106
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
I don't know.

107
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Anyway, um, it, uh, going back to the, uh, to the weather.

108
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,600
So now, of course, it's dark outside, but just imagine here,

109
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
if you've never been to Northern California, uh,

110
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
these are these are the nights that I really love.

111
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
It is so clear.

112
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
You can see stars.

113
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
You can see aircraft.

114
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,600
It has that crisp, cool kind of feeling to it outside.

115
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
It's just nice.

116
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,600
And I've got the, uh, the baker's rack all stacked up with the equipment.

117
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Uh, I have no light over here.

118
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Usually I'm doing this in the morning.

119
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I even have to, uh, draw the blind because of the sunlight coming through.

120
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
So I've got candles lit.

121
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,600
I've got a little incest go incense.

122
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Hello, Adam.

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Mike Turner here from Central Bristol, the thermo show podcast.

124
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,600
See, about, um, vote a phone of 3G broadband and then hit a one gig a month.

125
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
I'm actually by extra bandwidth if you need it just to let you know.

126
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
The egg gonna suddenly cut you off.

127
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
You possibly speak to them.

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Or you will just get build for the extra bandwidth.

129
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Anyway, just let you know, uh, choose for now.

130
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Yeah, that was one of the things that happened on Friday.

131
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Uh, you know, the first thing I did when I got up is I called the, uh,

132
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,600
customer support to get my, uh, my line re-provision, you know,

133
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,600
I had to wait 15 days before some other service disconnected real hassle.

134
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,600
And so because they closed, you know, of course it like six or seven o'clock in the UK,

135
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
the, the help desk.

136
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Or at least you're gonna get the second string team, you know.

137
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
So I called in went through the menus.

138
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,600
You know, you have to re-explain it every single time you call in and I got disconnected twice.

139
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Cox, it made me so angry.

140
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Uh, so but it's working for the girls.

141
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Uh, I'm gonna, can I not gonna, would there?

142
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I'm not gonna this candlestick. There we go.

143
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Uh, it's working and, you know, I had it hooked up to a Mac.

144
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,600
It was really good I went through that exercise because I went through quite a bit of exercise

145
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,600
myself here in the condo.

146
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,960
Let's get into it. You know what actually I think this we see if I can find it here

147
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Here we go it qualifies

148
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:48,520
104 104 104 you'll have moments 104 104 104 104 104 104 and moments

149
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,920
And now it's time for the 104 you'll have moment

150
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,320
It's not about conspiracy theories. It's about geeky stuff

151
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,400
So this that's a let it be fair warning for you that this is a geek moment here

152
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,960
So I've calm cast in the condo calm cast up generally been very happy with haven't ever had a real problem

153
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,920
I have their cable television service. I have the on-demand service. I have pretty much

154
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,760
All the the basic super packages you want. I don't have the sports package or anything like that

155
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,760
And I have their high speed internet and it's work pretty much show okay for me

156
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,960
Now what went wrong and you know that since I arrived Wednesday in the condo

157
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Conactivity was out

158
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,560
The the cable TV is all messed up. I

159
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,600
Think I know what happened and of course is very difficult when you have a building situation like I have here with a condo

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Where there's also work going on inside the building and I guess somewhere there's some company in the middle because

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,640
Comcast keeps talking about our building using a new provider for a

162
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Blah

163
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,040
You know it's you're not really getting the technical information out of the people who are to customer support

164
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Now I can recall

165
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:07,480
When setting up my cable set up here that the engineer spent quite a bit of time in the telco

166
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:16,120
Cable TV cabinet which each floor has one and and going through all this I recall him saying that something was messed up like my my

167
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,600
apartment was a rewired to the wrong junction box or something like that and took him a little bit longer to find action

168
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,600
You know to actually find the the cable that fed into my apartment

169
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,040
So I think that what happened is if indeed there was some kind of provider in the middle somewhere

170
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,200
between Comcast and my building that someone probably reinstalled something and said oh this cable belongs over here

171
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,880
And that's probably why I lost all my servers because Comcast can't see my mode

172
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,320
I mean I literally have no connection to Comcast. I'm getting just some kind of

173
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,720
Basic channels and a lot of stuff. I'm just not getting it. I don't know what's going on with the digital box

174
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,680
So I pretty much know what's going on and and you know go through a lot of back and forth on customer service and trying to figure it out

175
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,200
And you know they're blaming the building the building is saying it's the provider no one knows what the provider is or does

176
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,640
So I'm a little bit frustrated and finally I get an appointment for Monday between one and three in the

177
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
afternoon. How fucking convenient is that not?

178
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,920
And this I was throwing some trash out and as with the most buildings you know you have a little room

179
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,800
In between the elevators and it's the trash shoe

180
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,880
And I see there's a door there that says telco cable TV and it's a jar

181
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,200
You can of course only understand my delight. I

182
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:41,480
Open the door. It's not and it's real sticky. So I guess that the whoever was in there probably the provider and

183
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Just you know let the door shut and thought that it would close all the way but it didn't so immediately

184
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,800
I got a piece of cardboard and devised that so I couldn't get locked out and I

185
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,600
To make check to make sure that I couldn't get locked be locked in

186
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,240
And I'm taking video of all this. I want to do a video podcast of of what I set up

187
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:06,440
So anyway, so I go in and I it's very clear you know I see all the the the big cable stuff coming in the thick black cables

188
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,800
Which are for the the distribution system which is opened by the way this distribution cabinet

189
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,080
And then I see all the white cables for each individual apartment going into kind of like a

190
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,880
A mov colored box and like right that's where I got to be so I try and open it and has this real funky like

191
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,880
26. Allen key wrench lock on it. So

192
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,760
And without breaking the thing off the wall I'm never gonna get into it. I'm like, oh, I'm not gonna do that

193
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
And then I see something very interesting

194
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,760
I see a cable running up through a duct

195
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,600
Connected to an ethernet switch and that's switch is connected to I think I'm like a say which apartment but it's uh yeah

196
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,720
Actually it was like 25.05 or something. I don't know which apartment but I can see it hooked into one of those

197
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,400
Wiring bays, you know the ones with the plastic on it

198
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,200
So

199
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,920
So I'm like wow, you know, could it be so I

200
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,240
I grabbed my am I laptop? I plugged the laptop in and

201
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm telling you I had like super fast internet. So then I'm like, all right, this is awesome

202
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:18,840
All I have to do is create is get a cable connect it to that to the switch and then connected to one of the ports that come into my apartment

203
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,800
And I have

204
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:26,280
Five different wall plates with a and b and they're both RJ45 connectors so they'll take an ethernet jack

205
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,280
And I figure one is for telephone and one is for whatever you want to put on it

206
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,160
And clearly you can you can connect an ethernet cable into the that wired plastic wiring bay. What does that call by the way?

207
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,720
You use a punch-down tool to connect wires to it. I know that after some experimentation which we'll get into

208
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
So I spend

209
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,680
Man, I don't know when when when was this was this Friday? Yeah

210
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,320
Friday evening I spend the entire evening trying to wired up and of course I didn't have the proper tools

211
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:03,080
So I was using screwdrivers and all kinds of stuff and I just gave up and like this is not going to work

212
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:10,200
So what at the next best thing, right? I get my my de-link Wi-Fi. It's a links this makes this a Wi-Fi access point

213
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,360
I take it in a plug it in and of course now I'm broadcasting from the

214
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:21,400
From the telco room next to the trash shoot and I'm broadcasting my signal. So you know, I take the laptop and of course

215
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
As I walk into the door

216
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,080
Of the condo the signal pretty much dies because it's going through elevators through all kinds of walls

217
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:37,560
I mean Wi-Fi the distance is not that very far but Wi-Fi does not like to travel that way in fact when I open the door

218
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,000
It's like Wi-Fi was whafting in because then I could actually get it all the way into the hallway of the condo

219
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,840
So clearly and I tried all kinds of combinations and settings in place

220
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,920
But it's just a little 80 bd antenna and my laptop of course has to communicate back through it's little 80 bd antenna

221
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,560
So there's way too much going on and by the way what happened to humanity?

222
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,160
No one's leaving their Wi-Fi is open anymore. Oh

223
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,920
That's so sad anyone can suck off my pipe anytime

224
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,280
Oh, that'll make a nice outtake for someone somewhere

225
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,240
Okay, so I pretty much give up on this because you know, it's it's just not happened and I'm frustrated

226
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,840
I'm using the the internet tablet for just to check my email and it doing it through

227
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,760
Using the my cell phone to get a

228
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,560
Singular edge connection which is of course is really not not great for everything

229
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,360
I get a lot of practice on the on the internet tablet though, which was good because I'm starting to

230
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,120
Back out of my opinions on an on-screen keyboard, but that's for another day

231
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,120
So I know I need I I'm thinking it's gonna be

232
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:49,320
The way I've put these wires into this connector so I need some tools and I go looking around

233
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:55,160
Comp USA Radio Shack and you know, and it's just so iffy and you got to go in the sitting you don't if they'll actually have it

234
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,440
So I decide to make the trek out to Concord, California home of I think it's the original

235
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,800
I don't know if it's the original fries electronics with the one I've always been to and this is like mecha for geeks

236
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:15,000
Imagine a store that has everything from the single individually packaged transistor all the way up to high and flat screen

237
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,640
El see plasma displays everything in between you want a hard drive

238
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,120
I mean you want a camera you want a particular piece of cabling you want a punch down tool for one of those

239
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:36,040
Wacky plastic wiring blocks they got it 69 bucks by the way. There's not inexpensive tools and I figure I also get a wire tracer

240
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:43,560
How smart am I now? So I've got a little transmitter that can plug right into these jacks and then with a little probe I can go and see if the signals come in through

241
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,400
And I figure you know what just on a whim. I'm gonna grab one of those

242
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,600
High gain antennas for the D link as well because it's just a backup plan

243
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
So all right

244
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,520
There's a whole piece in the middle that I'm just gonna skip which I want to talk about in a second after

245
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,320
After we get through this story and I'm back and I'm

246
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,640
Doing my probing. I am probing around turns out the B is connected nowhere

247
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,920
It does not show up on that great A does but only two wires. So I don't know who did the wiring in this building

248
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:25,640
But someone cuts a major corners and in order to connect all what is it to eight is it eight?

249
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,760
Eight wires for pairs. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I'd have to know how to

250
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,200
Pull this plastic wiring block apart and I'm like now. Okay. This forget about it

251
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,960
That was really upsetting because I had some awesome tools and I did all the tracing but it's just their wiring is all messed up

252
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,960
So then I hook up the antenna thinking that this will do it. Well, it didn't really do it. It did however bring the signal probably

253
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Five feet further into the hallway

254
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
with five bars on

255
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,080
On the eye Mac actually because that's what I wound up doing so now I'm figuring out okay

256
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,640
It's not very convenient to sit on a chair in the hallway. I just want to be able to roam around

257
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,360
You know I need my I need my laptop in the bathroom when I'm listening to something while I'm taking a shower

258
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,520
I need it on the couch and you didn't the kitchen

259
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,400
I need to be able to watch my porn and bed. You know I need the bandwidth coming through

260
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,040
I can't be restricted to one spot. This is the sucks

261
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,920
So I had another linksis router. Oh, man. This is where all that experimentation with the a vote of phone

262
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,480
USB dongle thingy comes into play

263
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:43,880
So I am receiving the deal link on the eye Mac and then I'm using I'm sharing the internet on the Ethernet port

264
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:53,720
Which in turn is now sharing that connection with any with my laptop through Wi-Fi internally

265
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
So I had to rename

266
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,760
This because they were both named curry condo so I had to make one curry condo to I had to

267
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Manually configure all the IP addresses and it's and it works. It is so so amazing

268
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,080
I probably could have done it without the without the handy system tool for

269
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,200
Sharing your internet. I probably could have even figured out the routing. I haven't done it in a long long time

270
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,400
But it was so much fun and so incredibly rewarding that it actually works the only thing I had to do

271
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
really that was out of the ordinaries. I had to

272
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,720
Enter in a manual DNS server for every client that is now accessing the internal network

273
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,120
But I'm just so incredibly pleased with myself that I've done all this and tomorrow between one and three

274
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,040
Of course, I'll have to dismantle at hence the the need for taking video of it tonight

275
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,600
Because the calm cast engineer will be coming and that was

276
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
What not fun

277
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:04,280
Sometime later this week I'll delve into all the fantastic ideas you've given me for naming the the new cottage the new curry cottage

278
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,960
I think I actually have one of the many many entries this really caught on for you guys

279
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,720
It's almost like we're talking about splendor go daddy or something like that because it's everyone's all over this

280
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,760
And yeah, I'll leave that for tomorrow

281
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,520
But I don't want to withhold Mark Yoshimo Nemkov's entry

282
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,360
Play to stay and down there on the third floor. You'll visit sex dungeon today

283
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,160
Whips and chains and loop and lots of ass play

284
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,800
That's what you've come to expect and Adam Curry sex dungeon today

285
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,000
The hunky garden has been missing all week

286
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Maybe he'll turn up today

287
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,560
I got a feeling he just hanging around and Adam Curry sex dungeon today

288
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,240
Adam Curry's got a secret door that he'll go through so he can play

289
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,840
And if you win a really bad boy, it's time for a sex dungeon today

290
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,960
Adam Curry's got a black leather pink bonfaddle

291

And if you ask he'll grease you up and ride you around on a great big saddle

292
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,520
All the guilt for town tongues are widen about a place that's happy and gay

293
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,040
And now they're all lining up for Adam Curry sex dungeon today

294
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,880
Six dungeon oh yeah

295
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,240
Oh Mark Mark Mark Mark Mark

296
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,680
No one more thing about the

297
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
The entire Comcast experience

298
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,000
Their support number is 1-800-COMCAST

299
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,560
That's easy to remember right

300
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:32,040
Now do you realize that there are many telephones the E61 from Nokia included that no longer have the actual digits on the phone pad

301
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:39,960
Or then the the the letters associated with each individual digit I had of course I couldn't get on to the internet because I had no cable

302
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,360
I had to call someone and take a please look at your phone and tell me what comcast spells out it was nothing as simple as this

303
00:23:51,720 --> 00:24:01,720
3-4-7-1-1-1-1-1-6-2-5-6-3-1-7

304
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,400
Hey Chris it's CC Chapman one take a minute to welcome you to the pod show family

305
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,520
You probably saw him hanging around at podcasts but take in all these amazing pictures

306
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,960
Hey Chris it's Kelly from geek brief TV welcome to the pod show family

307
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,160
Hey Chris this is Trucker Tom welcoming you to pod show

308

Hey looking so much forward to shaking the world with you guys tips on the top floor dot beaty plachio

318
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
dot com

319
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,720
I'll tell you man. I think Julian Smith had it right welcome to the cult when I hear that it's like wow

320
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,280
Everybody

321
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,520
I have some bad news my friends. I'm sorry that I must tell you the Trinity

322
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,560
Has had her three strikes. Yes, this is a one piece of the story

323
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,760
I didn't tell you about my trip to fries and all the gear. I bought to fix my internet's

324
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
internet's situation

325
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
until we read love

326
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
On the way back about

327
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,280
4 miles outside of Concord on route 24 west I lost power

328
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,440
It was pretty clear it was once again fuel starvation

329
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
I could just tell by the engine

330
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,280
and

331
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:23,560
I tried to turn over a couple of times I pulled right over on the just before the moraga exit

332
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,080
Lafayette california on the shoulder very very narrow shoulder by the way

333
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:36,280
Try to a couple of times and no good so once again. I was determined to get my money out of the triple a

334
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,960
I was guys are so great man. They were there within 20 minutes loaded Trinity onto the flat bed. I think what's happened

335
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,840
Then I discussed this with Chris who was the driver of the flat bed

336
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,120
I think that because he was not only interested but seemed quite knowledgeable of biodiesel

337
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,440
Because you know what happens is with any diesel really but also with biodiesel

338
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,720
Maybe because there could be some more more sediment and other stuff in there that just burns away with normal use

339
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,720
But only cranking her up once a month. That's not gonna work stuff is settling stuff is clogging up

340
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,760
I'm pretty sure that this is a filter or another fuel pump issue. I just had the fuel pump replaced

341
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,120
Or at least they say it's replaced. It's been replaced. It's 200 bucks worth of something they did

342
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,320
So

343
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:26,760
Unfortunately the science project is just not for me. I do need reliable wheels when I'm in San Francisco

344
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,880
But of course I feel really bad about this because I only have one parking spot. I can't keep her

345
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:39,000
But really I'm doing the car no justice by you know by just having it sitting there and not being driven so

346
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,120
I want to give it away and I want to give it away to

347
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,720
one of you loyal DSC listeners

348
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,320
But you have to really promise and maybe that's I haven't figured out how we're gonna give it away yet

349
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
But she has to have a good home and

350
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,680
She has to be well taken care of and I'll make sure that she's in running order. I'm not gonna give you a busted up car

351
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
I'll make sure it's repaired whatever needs to be done

352
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,960
But this is what I did this with another car when we moved from New Jersey

353
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,840
99 after Ron and I sold the previous company think new ideas

354
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,160
And we retired and moved back to Europe had a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow 2. I had driven that thing 85,000 mile

355
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,520
I love that car

356
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,400
Brewster green classic car just fantastic and I gave it away to

357
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,880
Fred the fireman who was a volunteer fireman and in uh I think it was a ball he lived in Brona, but it was a monk layer

358
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,840
Volunteer not volunteer

359
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
He worked for the fire department. He also

360
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Later

361
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,320
Played a pretty significant role in the Twin Towers 9-11

362
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,800
And his wife, uh, Lordist, Lou

363
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
She was our housekeeper in Jersey and

364
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,320
Patricia and I were good friends with both of them and so I said Fred, you know, would you please just take care of the car

365
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,640
Just take it off my hands and they call it the Duchess and they still drive it, you know, at least twice a week

366
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,840
They take it out on Sundays

367
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,960
So that's what I want, you know, I just I don't need anything for it

368
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,160
I just I want to come for the fun way to to give it away and to make sure that she has a really nice home

369
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:16,680

I heard it on I love the company

Which of course the David Baleito from New York now with his phone. He's got the hot hot toast

419
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,680
Oh, baby keep played a song today, man

420
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
crap. It was

421
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,920
What was it called? I'll be your bitch or something. It was hilarious

422
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,640
I was it to David Schwartzman. I think who

423
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,120
Did the Bill Clinton got a blowjob and of course the song is available anywhere so I'm gonna stay

424
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,800
But if you can get clearance when to play it

425
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,680
I'll see if I can play that tomorrow again. I want to talk about this whole flap of in Britain over big brother and racism and

426
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,680
Have some have some views on that

427

But that's for another show. I liked it today. I hope you guys liked it, too

428
