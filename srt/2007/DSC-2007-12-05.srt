You're a gotta-see at him, putting on a show when you're feeling like shit, that's great stuff.

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,560
You don't man, Adam Curry, bring on the DSC-696.

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:04,720
It's Monday morning and I'm back in work again, thank you for telling me to work until I'm dead.

7
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,720
I've got a boss man and he's spent being the man.

8
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:17,720
I should have died and I wish I was in bed, it's Monday morning and I'm back in work again.

9
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Get the boss man and he's in work until I'm dead.

10
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,720
I've got a boss man and he's spent being the man.

11
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Don't you ever know that he's in jail.

12
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Something I've heard before I am in my way.

14
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,720
Loading his friends when I'm home and got his fame.

15
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,720
I've been so bad shot.

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

17
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

18
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

19
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

20
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

21
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

22
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

25
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

26
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

27
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

29
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

30
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

31
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

32
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

33
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

34
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,720
But don't you ever know that he's in jail.

37
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,720
Oh yeah.

38
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,720
A soundtrack to my life for sure.

39
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
At least to track to it.

40
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
Airborne.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
I'm so sick.

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
You don't ever love about punk rock.

43
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
And of course this comes from the podseg music network.

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,720
Just about the moment you're thinking.

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
And this song is actually a bunch of noise.

46
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
Then it's over.

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
It's always short.

48
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Two minutes to 12 seconds.

49
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Love it.

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Hey everybody.

51
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
Episode number 696.

52
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,720
It's a palindrome.

53
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Still in San Francisco.

54
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
Looks pretty much like when to be here the rest of the week.

55
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
But it's okay.

56
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Except for the weather, which today was raining, which was really shitty.

57
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
I had an okay night.

58
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,720
I went to bed after the after the show last night.

59
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
I slept through most of the night.

60
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,720
I slept through a couple of phone calls, which is pretty extraordinary for me.

61
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,720
I have the phone literally next to my bed.

62
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,720
And I have that because, you know, if it's anything with the girls, I want them to be able to call me.

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,720
It wasn't them, of course, who called me as other people who thought I was back in the UK.

64
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
You know, text messages go off.

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
So I didn't hear any of them.

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
I was really out for the counts.

67
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Still, you know, much better.

68
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
I had my first real food.

69
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,720
I had some oatmeal at the office this morning.

70
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
And much better.

71
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Much much better.

72
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,720
I still a little bit shaky and going real easy on what I'm eating.

73
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,720
But what a day, huh?

74
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,720
I would say pretty much this report that came out from the EIN.

75
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
I believe it is.

76
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,720
We said that well, guess why do Ron has no nuclear weapons program?

77
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,720
Hasn't had it for, you know, everyone's saying four years.

78
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
But it's almost five years now.

79
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,720
We hit 2008.

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,720
And exactly as expected, the spin is a word dangerous.

81
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
It can be dangerous.

82
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
That will be dangerous.

83
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,720
It's like, come on, please, we're not going to let it happen, right?

84
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,720
We are not going to let it happen again.

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
So there's no weapons of mass destruction.

86
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
It's not there.

87
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Obviously, you're going to, you know, keep an eye on what everyone's doing for different reasons.

88
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,720
But maybe the proper response, Mr. President, represented of the people,

89
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,720
would have been, hey, you know, I'm really happy.

90
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
That's pretty damn cool.

91
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
All right, dudes.

92
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,720
We had to go and run.

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,720
You know, we should chill and have a beer at the ranch.

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,720
You know, it looks like we're in compliance.

95
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
We're, we understand each other.

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,720
So I don't have a lot of energy today.

97
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
I just don't physically have it.

98
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
In fact, what time is it now?

99
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,720
It's 10, 10, 10, 10, 10.

100
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Everybody, 10 pass the hour here in the Curry Condu.

101
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
That would mean it's much, it's tomorrow.

102
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
We know, Australia.

103
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,720
It's tomorrow everywhere, basically.

104
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
But luckily, a lot of comments came in,

105
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,720
particularly in response to yesterday's show 6, 9 or 5.

106
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,720
And the first one is about the clip from Eisenhower that I played.

107
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,720
And I didn't realize this before I heard this comment come in.

108
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Hey, Adam, it's Paul, the tech guy from Kirkland, Washington.

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,720
What we're talking about was at 6.95.

110
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
You know, you had interesting thing.

111
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
You had eye con there.

112
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Eisenhower.

113
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
And it's amazing.

114
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Wait, hold on.

115
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
What's amazing to me is you said you had an eye con there.

116
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,720
And the first thing that shot into my mind was like a desktop eye con.

117
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,720
And it took me, I'm sure there are other people out there.

118
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,720
It took me a second to figure out he was talking about a person.

119
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Eisenhower as the eye con.

120
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,720
I just wanted to mess with your brain because I knew it was happening with it.

121
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
It's amazing.

122
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,720
You think it's amazing how intelligent he sounds and how together he sounds

123
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,720
and how why he sounds and his speech is president compared to what we have today.

124
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:38,720
I mean, you listen to today where you used to listen to this guy that seems to really have some forethought

125
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,720
into the world is interesting.

126
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Anyway, just a little thing.

127
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
I like I too.

128
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
I guess anyway.

129
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Oh, and I love you.

130
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
Adam Curry.

131
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,720
All right.

132
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Yeah, you know, and absolutely right.

133
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
And you go back.

134
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
If you hadn't heard, if you didn't hear, yes, there's episode.

135
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Go back and listen to it.

136
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
He did have so he sounded like a leader.

137
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,720
You know, and he was making some sense there.

138
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,720
It wasn't just a part of the show, part of the big show.

139
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,720
For those of you who are really active on the show and go to dailysourceco.com

140
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
and check out the comments.

141
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,720
There's always, you know, there's always at least three or four comments for every episode.

142
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,720
I never say there's really a whole bunch of them.

143
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,720
But this one guy I think is Bill Gilton or I think is his name.

144
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
In fact, we'll find out for sure in a second.

145
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,720
He's always posting something in the comments.

146
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
And in fact, he's, I think the only person I ever said,

147
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Yo, you know, Bill, he's up on all the embeddable videos and stuff.

148
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
It's not entirely on topic.

149
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,720
And but he's, he's a savant in his own right.

150
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,720
I think he may go a little bit too far to the extreme on some of the,

151
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,720
some of the conspiracy.

152
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
I don't want to say conspiracy theories.

153
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,720
And some of the theories, just theories, that he's following.

154
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
But Bill called in and I'm happy he called in for once because, you know,

155
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,720
it gives me a little chance and gives all of us little chance to,

156
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,720
to listen to the guy and find out a little bit more about him.

157
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,720
And it's a, he actually hit the cut off on the, on the comment call in.

158
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,720
But I think we should all take a listen because he is,

159
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
with it out, a part of the Charlie family.

160
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,720
And certainly the comments about.

161
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Hey, and I'm, it's Bill, you're holding her from Austin, Texas.

162
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,720
I've been enjoying your podcast even though I haven't called in for quite a while.

163
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,720
And I've been amazed overall looking back at the year of,

164
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
of, 2007.

165
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,720
The amount of grounds you've covered on the DSE.

166
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
It's been pretty amazing.

167
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,720
And I never would have expected you would have started the,

168
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,720
I know agenda podcast that John, to, to Borough.

169
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,720
And that's been quite entertaining.

170
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Overall there's just been a lot of material to review and enjoy

171
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
through podcasting.

172
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
And I would just want to appreciate that.

173
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm not sure I can, want to say a lot of you,

174
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
but I understand that it's,

175
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Well, that technically violates the rules of commenting,

176
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
but I'll let you slide.

177
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
The change as you announced on your,

178
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,720
the DSE today to maybe get away from the old ad,

179
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,720
but that let's see.

180
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,720
I agree with you completely about the political analysis,

181
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
how it's all just a big show.

182
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,720
And especially when it comes to this idea

183
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
that how could be is going to be,

184
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
you know,

185
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
I've been coming horse,

186
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
and you know,

187
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
it's, you might as well have a big person

188
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,720
and somebody to call the horse race as it goes.

189
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
You know, and let me just repeat that.

190
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,720
I really believe that how could be is being played.

191
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,720
He's being played by the media that they're going to toss him up like,

192
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
like an orca whale does with a sea line.

193
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
You know,

194
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
you know,

195
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
they bat him around for a while.

196
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
That's what I think.

197
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
I think it's a total set up.

198
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
I could be wrong and, you know,

199
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
power to the guy.

200
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,720
He actually says a lot of things that Ron Paul says.

201
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,720
I don't agree with everything he says.

202
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
And I, you know,

203
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
I've chosen my guy for this, for this round,

204
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
for this time around.

205
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
And of course,

206
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
the Chuck Norris thing was funny.

207
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
That was, that was very cool.

208
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
But I have a feeling he's being played,

209
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
and he's going to,

210
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,720
they're going to tear him to shreds.

211
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
As much as it means.

212
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
But underneath of course,

213
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
all our lives are all are affected,

214
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,720
and we do need to figure out

215
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,720
some way to get control of this whole mess.

216
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
And if you think you're feeling old,

217
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
I'll be turning 50 here in a few months.

218
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,720
So you can imagine that your discussion of Abby Hoffman,

219
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,720
and that was more of an early 70s kind of teenager,

220
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,720
but definitely I had the idea that we were trying to whip

221
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
a bunch of these problems way back went,

222
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
and boy is that turned out to be a joke.

223
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Some ways, I think,

224
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,720
the situations a lot worse and more dire than you do.

225
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,720
I definitely listened to Alex Jones,

226
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
although it's good to listen to him.

227
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
I don't think he's really someone he can

228
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
can lead us anywhere,

229
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,720
so I think he turns a lot of people off.

230
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
So I have mixed ideas when you start mentioning

231
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
some of the things that are associated with

232
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,720
the more crazy conspiracy stuff.

233
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
But as you may know,

234
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,720
I post there at 911truth.podshow.com.

235
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
I post some things that other people think

236
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,720
or some of the wackiest conspiracy that could be imagined.

237
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,720
So I guess to each zone,

238
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,720
it was kind of funny to listen to Carmen Tyler's podcast

239
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,720
and find out that she knew how to be evidently.

240
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
She had some interaction with him over the years,

241
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,720
and is knows in pretty well

242
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
from one way or another.

243
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
She didn't say she supported him.

244
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
She just said it was funny to

245
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,720
know a presidential candidate like that personally,

246
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
which is entertaining.

247
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Anyway, so I'm rambling on.

248
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Thanks for providing the pod show

249
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
and all the personalities and

250
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
regardless of whether we whip some of these

251
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,720
fundamental governmental problems.

252
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,720
And that's where it ends, unfortunately.

253
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Because I know he's going to say he loves me at the end of that

254
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
comment.

255
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Thanks Bill.

256
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
I'll go to the next time if you don't mind.

257
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Actually, while Bill was talking,

258
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,720
I ran quick to the bedroom here in the condo.

259
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,720
To grab the weekend edition of the financial

260
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
times, which is printed,

261
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,720
well, it's probably printed locally,

262
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
but it's,

263
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
uh,

264
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,720
a lot of the editorial comes from the UK.

265
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Here it is.

266
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
I found it.

267
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Thank goodness.

268
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
They also have, obviously,

269
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
they have journalists in the states.

270
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
This is a piece written by

271
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Christia Freeland.

272
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
And,

273
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
it's a really interesting piece.

274
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
Of course, I'm not going to read the whole thing to you.

275
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
But it's, it really caught my eye when I read it.

276
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
It starts off by saying,

277
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
by stereotype,

278
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
America is a pretty optimistic place.

279
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
In my personal experience,

280
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
I've found that to be true.

281
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
Even in New York,

282
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
I don't have a lot of light here,

283
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
so I'm kind of,

284
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
I'm reading by the light of the laptop.

285
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
Even in New York,

286
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
which pride itself on being tougher than the

287
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
sunny heart loons.

288
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Half a dozen people urge me to have a nice day

289
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
by the time I get to my desk each morning.

290
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Yet this land of Disney and a motocons seems

291
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
rather downbeat at the moment,

292
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
particularly about its own role in the world.

293
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
The post-cold war expectation of an era

294
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
of the easy and benign American dominance

295
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
now looks hopelessly romantic.

296
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
And she goes on to talk about,

297
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
really all of the,

298
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
all of the problems that the states

299
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
is going through,

300
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
you know,

301
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
how the rest of the world

302
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
certainly can view us.

303
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
And she's viewing it through the eyes

304
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
of basically a European.

305
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
But what I really liked

306
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
is the way she wraps it up.

307
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Let me see if I can get to the right spot

308
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
here, hold on.

309
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Crap, I wish I had more light.

310
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
And you're sitting there going,

311
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,720
like, get on with it already, curry.

312
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Here we go.

313
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,720
So of course, a lot about the sub-prime crisis.

314
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,720
And winds up us saying openness.

315
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
So, you know, what are the,

316
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
I want to find the right spot to jump into this.

317
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
It's too long.

318
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
Openness is valuable in and of itself.

319
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Once we are safe and fed,

320
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
liberty isn't enduring human need.

321
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
But even if that sounds to you like the abstraction

322
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
of a latte drinking liberal,

323
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
I think you will agree that openness

324
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
to money, to ideas, to people

325
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
is one of the most important drivers

326
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
of which economies will flourish

327
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,720
in which ones will founder in the coming century.

328
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,720
By all means, watch how the supreme saga unfolds.

329
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
But if you want to know if America will remain great,

330
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,720
look to whether investors from Abu Dhabi remain welcome.

331
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
College kids continue to found new Facebooks

332
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,720
and immigrants for all the pre-election

333
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,720
fewer continue to make their homes here.

334
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
And I thought, you know,

335
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
and you have to, if you can get it,

336
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
I'll see if I can put a link to this article.

337
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
If it's available online,

338
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
you really have to read the whole thing because

339
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,720
it does give a view of America

340
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
in a way that I agree with.

341
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,720
And that there is something that remains to be very special here

342
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
in the United States.

343
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Just as I'm sure,

344
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
and I wish I could get some Iranians on this show,

345
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,720
we have no idea what Iranians are really like.

346
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Please.

347
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
If you know an Iranian,

348
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
if you know someone living in Iran,

349
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
please get me in touch with them.

350
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Let's talk.

351
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
I hear that, you know,

352
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,720
90% of that country is like under 30 years old.

353
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
I know they have internet.

354
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
I can speak a little bit of French,

355
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
maybe some of them speak some English.

356
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
We can work it out.

357
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
We need to get a long people.

358
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
And I need to switch gears for a second.

359
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Happy holidays, Adam.

360
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Yeah, I'm happy holidays and Merry Christmas

361
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,720
from the Daddycast, from the Love House to your house.

362
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Ah, lovely.

363
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Yeah, let's talk about that for a second.

364
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
You know what?

365
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,720
To kick it off as we're talking about the holidays.

366
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Yeah, come on.

367
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
I'm sweating.

368
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
You're breaking out.

369
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
I beat up a satellite repair man

370
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
coming after you.

371
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
satellite repair man.

372
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
What's he gonna do?

373
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,720
He'll fit your misconceptions and answer questions too.

374
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
There's nothing in the universe

375
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
so he can't do for you.

376
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
satellite repair man.

377
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Woo, woo, woo.

378
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
satellite repair man.

379
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Man, I am so glad you dropped the closing

380
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,720
expletive requirement for voice comments on the DSC.

381
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,720
That was just something I was not really comfortable

382
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
with saying to my boss.

383
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
I've gotten myself on enough trouble without

384
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
ever telling the boss.

385
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Damn, I almost said it.

386
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Yeah, at least not to my face, Peter.

387
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
I get you.

388
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,720
But hey, I'm here to pimp my own show digital

389
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,720
I've got some the latest episode features yours truly

390
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,720
reading the famous night before Christmas

391
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
from my earliest memories

392
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
reading that poem on Christmas Eve

393
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
was a tradition in my house

394
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,720
and I am now extending it to everyone's house

395
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,720
as my happy Christmas wish to all.

396
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
I love you, Adam Curry.

397
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
No, really.

398
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Yeah, I love you too, Peter.

399
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
For sure.

400
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,720
Adam, it's a monster even in San Francisco Bay area.

401
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Hey, Steve.

402
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
That's really sucks.

403
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
I don't get it.

404
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
The kind of stuff has the tendency to travel.

405
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Yeah.

406
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Okay, so I mean this in no sense with no sense whatsoever

407
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
to Mr. Steve Webb.

408
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Oh, that's always the setup.

409
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
I mean no offense.

410
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Here it comes.

411
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
I'm really getting sick of people

412
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
accusing somebody or other

413
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
out there of trying to get

414
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
word rid of the word Christmas

415
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
and replace it with happy holidays.

416
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
That very Christmas goes away

417
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,720
and we're all saying happy holidays.

418
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,720
Now, dude, appreciate it.

419
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
It's not happening.

420
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
It's in your head.

421
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
It's a made up conspiracy.

422
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Nobody's freaking doing that.

423
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,720
I see no offense, but you know, it's in your head.

424
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
I've got a song.

425
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
One of my favorite Christmas songs.

426
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Andy Williams singing happy holidays

427
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
from the freaking early 60s.

428
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
It's not before.

429
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
It's not happening.

430
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Nobody's nobody.

431
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
There's no conspiracy against Christmas.

432
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,720
You're listening to Bill Riley or one of those other Irish idiots.

433
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
There is so conspiracy.

434
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
So Boston cuisine.

435
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Stop it.

436
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Fuck you Adam Curry.

437
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

438
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Wait a minute.

439
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
That's not okay.

440
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
So I'm Steve again.

441
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,720
Obviously, I didn't get all the way through the podcast.

442
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
He ended my comment the wrong way.

443
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
I do love you.

444
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Adam Curry.

445
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Yeah.

446
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
I want to make babies with you.

447
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Okay.

448
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
All right. That's enough.

449
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Yeah, man.

450
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,720
You know, I think what

451
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Steve looked from the life-spring family of podcasts.

452
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,720
What Steve Webb is probably hearing is that advertising

453
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
has done away with Christmas,

454
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,720
advertising has made it into happy holidays.

455
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
And this is just because advertising wants

456
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
the biggest bank for your book.

457
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,720
It's a lot cheaper to say,

458
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,720
let me see if I can get the the the

459
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Christians, the Jews all in one shot.

460
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,720
By the way, happy Hanukkah.

461
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Don't we like the first candle tonight?

462
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Where are those phone calls?

463
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Excuse me, I'm for clement.

464
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
I got to play the Hanukkah song.

465
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
There's a couple of them on the podcast.

466
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Music, now we're tomorrow.

467
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Remind me.

468
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
That's what it is.

469
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Andy Rooney, I saw him.

470
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
I'm like sick bed.

471
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
I was watching 60 minutes.

472
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
I saw Andy Rooney.

473
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
And he had exactly the segment.

474
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,720
He showed all of the catalogs that were jammed through

475
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
his mailbox for Christmas for the holiday season.

476
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,720
And not a single one said Merry Christmas or happy Hanukkah.

477
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,720
They all or happy quans.

478
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Whatever.

479
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,720
So much out there.

480
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,720
They all say happy holidays and it's just because it's cheaper that way.

481
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
You know, you want to don't want to reach just one segment.

482
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,720
You want to reach the you want your dollar to go further.

483
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
It's that easy.

484
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
So I think that's what's really happening.

485
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
I have to agree.

486
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
And I'm enjoying all the Christmas movies.

487
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,720
I love all the, you know, how I saw the one with Jacqueline Smith.

488
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Or she's flying a sessna over like the Arctic or

489
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Alaska or something.

490
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
God.

491
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
I had a crush on her.

492
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
I still do really.

493
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
She was always kind of a milk.

494
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
And she's awesome.

495
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Jacqueline Smith.

496
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
And then what happened to her?

497
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
Didn't she do the Kmart ads for a while?

498
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Or Kmart?

499
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
I can't remember.

500
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Anyway.

501
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Here's what we'll do.

502
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Let's do something completely different from normal.

503
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,720
Instead of playing, and again, I'm just going to run through more comments

504
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
because there's so many good ones that came in.

505
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Let's just keep it in the Christmas vibe with a little, a little Christmas

506
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Diddy will do DSC style.

507
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
Ready?

508
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Let's bang your head.

509
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
The monster balance for the podcast music network.

510
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,720
This is ducking.

511
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,720
And then watch out.

512
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
You better not cry.

513
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,720
Better not come till you.

514
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Why?

515
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,720
Santa Claus is coming.

516
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,720
To town.

517
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
She's making a list.

518
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
And shaking the twice.

519
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Gonna find that last night.

520
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
And nice.

521
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Santa Claus is coming.

522
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,720
To town.

523
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,720
He sees you when you're sleeping.

524
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,720
He knows when you're awake.

525
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,720
He knows if you think that or not.

526
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
So be good for good.

527
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
You say you know.

528
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
Better watch out.

529
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
You better not cry.

530
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,720
Better not come up till you.

531
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Why?

532
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Santa Claus is coming.

533
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,720
To town.

534
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Santa Claus is coming.

535
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
To town.

536
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Santa Claus is coming.

537
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
To town.

538
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Santa Claus is coming.

539
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
To town.

540
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Santa Claus is coming.

541
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
To town.

542
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Santa Claus is coming.

543
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
To town.

544
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Santa Claus is coming.

545
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,720
To town.

546
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Santa Claus is coming.

547
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,720
To town.

548
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,720
To town.

549
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Santa Claus is coming.

550
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,720
To town.

551
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Santa Claus is coming.

552
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,720
To town.

553
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Santa Claus is coming.

554
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,720
To town.

555
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Santa Claus is coming.

556
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,720
I almost makes it sound like no fun.

557
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Let's go.

558
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
the press about Santa comment.

559
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
He's like...

560
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Oh yeah, duck in.

561
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Hey, speaking of Santa Claus coming to town.

562
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Hello, Adam Curry. This is Oscar from the Netherlands.

563
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,720
So, I guess I don't know what kind of feel you're taking,

564
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,720
but I think it's red, very red, and...

565
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Well, it kind of made you sick.

566
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
So, what is that coming here?

567
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Too much red.

568
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Anyway, I wish you a good health, and just when they need to go to San Francisco,

569
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,720
I hope the weather stays good, because the press deck is really fucked up on Thursday and Friday.

570
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,720
I need to go through the birthday area well, for some kind of meeting.

571
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
So, I don't know, man.

572
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
What are you doing?

573
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,720
I just wish you a good health, and you're really sounded really down,

574
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,720
and I hope everything goes very well with you.

575
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Well, that's it. Oh, and...

576
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Yeah.

577
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
I love you, Adam Curry.

578
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Thank you.

579
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,720
By the way, if you've called in and you said it once, you don't have to say it every single time.

580
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Unless you really want to, obviously.

581
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Here's something interesting.

582
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,720
This was a very interesting call. I had to think about it a couple of times before I finally...

583
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,720
I think before I finally figured it out, and it's... well, let's listen to an older.

584
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Hi, Alan.

585
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,720
This is Eric from Iowa, and I just had the call in, because I had the weirdest thing happen.

586
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,720
I just heard that I didn't have anybody else, but my husband must have some sort of weird virus on his computer

587
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:50,720
that he was just on internet and just playing around, and any max voice topped up and started talking.

588
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,720
It's the weirdest thing it was like one of our shows was playing,

589
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
but there was no windows open or anything.

590
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,720
You never even heard who Amy Mac was, and it's just something you're sure that I even knew who Amy Mac was.

591
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,720
So, I don't know if you have anybody else in this problem, or if there's a virus coming around where some pod shows

592
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,720
like start popping up and playing a people's computer.

593
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
I decided it was weird.

594
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
I'm glad you're back.

595
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,720
Alright, first of all, love the voice, send me naked pictures.

596
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Your husband was not... I mean, what did you say?

597
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
He was just surfing around the computer.

598
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,720
He was looking for porn, first of all, home I was.

599
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Listen, what was my husband doing?

600
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,720
My husband must have some sort of weird virus on his computer that he was on internet.

602
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
Yeah, just on the internet.

603
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Was the webcam on?

604
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
No, look.

605
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Clearly, he was surfing for porn.

606
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Actually, I thought about this and like, well, this is kind of weird.

607
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,720
I don't want to troubleshoot everyone's computer problems,

608
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,720
but to think you have a virus that makes Amy Mac play on your computer,

609
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
I see as a feature.

610
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
So I'm like, this is great.

611
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,720
What is going on?

612
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,720
And then I remember, we've been doing a whole bunch of experiments with promoting the network.

613
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Folks, there's a Google group.

614
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,720
If you're a pod show producer, you should join that.

615
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
There's a Google group.

616
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,720
Marcus couch maintains it right now, and we talk shit amongst ourselves.

617
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
Really talk shit, which is fun.

618
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
And so I've mentioned it there.

619
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,720
And we've been trying different ways of promoting.

620
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,720
And I recall, and I, you know, first of all, I hate pop-ups, pop-unders, windows,

621
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
and crap shit like that, that just I hate it.

622
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
So we would never do that.

623
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,720
But on the peer-to-peer networks, you now have advertising opportunities.

624
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,720
And I know that we've done some test runs, advertising on peer-to-peer networks.

625
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,720
And the way that works, apparently, and as someone set me a screenshot of it the other week,

626
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,720
is that it pops up a browser window with an ad.

627
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,720
And in this case, that probably would have been a flash video of Amy Mack show.

628
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,720
Now, it couldn't have been on any other type of advertising network,

629
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,720
because they don't allow you to have sound on by default.

630
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,720
So I think it was probably from a peer-to-peer network.

631
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,720
And it's kind of, it's kind of interesting the way these things work.

632
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
And obviously, it's not working.

633
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:24,720
It's quite annoying because, you know, if you can't see where it's coming from, then something's not right.

634
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
So let's try and figure this one out.

635
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Call back.

636
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Let me know.

637
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,720
And, you know, your husband clearly was surfing on a, he was on peer-to-peer.

638
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Looking for porn.

639
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,720
So don't feel bad when you send me the naked picture.

640
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
And let's see if we can work this one out.

641
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Because that's highly annoying.

642
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
That's not advertising.

643
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
That's annoying.

644
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,720
But, of course, it may be to get your husband to check out Amy Mack.

645
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
So, yeah, who knows, right?

646
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Hey, Adam.

647
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,720
It's Jeff Sass here calling you after a nice early morning running along the beach.

648
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,720
And beautiful South Florida opening through the beach.

649
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Nice.

650
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Well, the 800 and the 10th.

651
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
I bought it in 800, which I love.

652
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
Thanks to your recommendation.

653
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,720
I'm using it as my mobile phone in Europe with Skype.

654
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Since I don't have a GSM phone.

655
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
I'm a sprint customer, otherwise.

656
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,720
But mine is in mint conditions.

657
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Beautifully cared for in a nice leather case.

658
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,720
And I'm trying to figure out what to do with it when I upgrade to the N810 as soon as you put your special offer available.

659
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
So maybe I show.

660
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,720
For some of you guys can organize some sort of a.

661
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Exchange or swap or maybe.

662
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,720
For those listeners, you don't want to spring the full price for it.

663
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
A 10.

664
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,720
But want to get a great and a hundred at a good deal.

665
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Maybe you guys can help facilitate that.

666
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,720
And anyway, let's be forward to the deal.

667
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Hopefully in time for Christmas.

668
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Talk to you soon.

669
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Yeah.

670
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,720
And by the way, I've gotten a lot of reports for people saying that they put the new OS 2008 on their N800.

671
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
And that they love it.

672
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
You know, it's optimized.

673
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
I think that's the same processor.

674
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,720
A lot of the bits in these two machines are the same.

675
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Of course, the the slide out keyboard is the main main difference in this.

676
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,720
Some dimensional aspects that there's a lot of differences.

677
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,720
But the new OS definitely is a huge improvement over the previous one.

678
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,720
A lot of the things work much better out of the box like the media player finally makes sense.

679
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,720
Of course, the the browser, the Mozilla Gmail Google Docs.

680
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
You just can't beat it.

681
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
I'm doing Gmail on this thing all the time.

682
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Now with a shortcut keys.

683
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,720
I mean, there's no command.

684
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
No mouse.

685
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,720
So I know touch that can beat that.

686
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Nothing beats the keyboard in just some cases, which is why, you know,

687
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:36,720
the same JK commands NP commands and O and V are having used for decades in computering.

688
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Because it's just easier.

689
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
But we could set up an exchange.

690
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,720
I mean, you could post it on daily source code dot com or curry dot com.

691
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
I mean, anyway, like that.

692
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,720
I'm sure that would be a good way.

693
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,720
And, you know, looking at the prices these days on Amazon that go in for like a hundred bucks.

694
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,720
So you might just want to hold on to it turn it into a web server or something.

695
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
It's a little low.

696
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
You can get a web server package.

697
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,720
So you could have a wireless web server wherever you go.

698
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
I mean, there's all kinds of fun things.

699
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
You could do with it.

700
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
You know, you could shit.

701
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,720
You know, I just thought, you know, all this talk about the hundred dollar laptop.

702
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
One laptop or child thing.

703
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
There you go.

704
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
Giving the $100 and $800.

705
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
That's a laptop.

706
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
It would beat every other project.

707
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Send it to send it to the third world countries.

708
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
That's actually not a bad idea.

709
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
No case to think about that.

710
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,720
What a great PR idea that is.

711
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,720
We have the the $100 laptop.

712
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
There you go.

713
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,720
You know, people hand crank on that sucker.

714
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
They sell.

715
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
Don't the for these cell phones.

716
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,720
You can get solar chargers.

717
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Yeah.

718
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
I think I just came up with a real idea.

719
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
All right.

720
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
I got a couple of way.

721
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
31 minutes.

722
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
Okay.

723
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
I can bore you guys some more.

724
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Actually, I'm not going to bore you because it's always exciting when you hear this.

725
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
Jingo.

726
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
Come extra.

727
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Come extra.

728
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
Come extra.

729
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Come extra.

730
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Come extra.

731
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
Come extra.

732
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Come extra.

733
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
Come extra.

734
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Come extra.

735
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
Come extra.

736
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Come extra.

737
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
Come extra.

738
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
Come extra.

739
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
Hello.

740
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Hello.

741
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,720
Speaking of military industrial complex of USA.

742
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,720
The GPS system has been conceived and created by US military to be able

743
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,720
to precisely bump somebody.

744
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,720
And when US Army conducts military operations like, for example, bumping some country,

745
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,720
then GPS system is being authenticated by US Army.

746
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,720
And location fix will civilians like yourself is impossible.

747
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,720
Yeah.

748
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
Okay.

749
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
A little translation.

750
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
So yes, be.

751
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,720
So this is about the global positioning system.

752
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,720
And indeed, since it is owned and controlled by the United States,

753
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
it can be jammed.

754
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
There's all kinds of shit that can be done to it.

755
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,720
You know, it took years to just get the accuracy back by discrampling some bits.

756
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,720
I am, of course, paraphrasing what actually went on.

757
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
A lot of people depend on it.

758
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:08,720
But it's kind of, it's kind of frightening to think that for, for certain reasons, it could just get turned off.

759
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,720
You know, God forbid, we have to go back to finding VORs and NDBs to shoot our approaches.

760
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,720
I mean, Jesus, how will I fly if I don't have my GPS?

761
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,720
How will I find my way home in my car?

762
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
Hmm.

763
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,720
So I think, me thinks that it is good idea that you appear in your own.

764
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,720
It's just agreed to finance.

765
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:38,720
And after all, complete Galileo, Galileo positioning system, which is more precise than GPS.

766
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,720
And right from the scratch created from, from peaceful purposes.

767
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Galileo will be built after all with bases in Germany and Italy.

768
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,720
For the control centers.

769
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,720
By the way, are you coming to Barcelona to mobile work congress in February next year, Adam?

770
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
You?

771
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
You?

772
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,720
Where's my love you?

773
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Yeah.

774
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
I don't know, maybe.

775
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Maybe I'll come.

776
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,720
Ah, excuse me, I'm cramping.

777
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Um, yes, so, um, comics are blogger.

778
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,720
I'd love to know if there are any extra bits that are throwing into the Galileo system.

779
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,720
So, and, and by the way, it's, it's a, it's a beautiful gesture.

780
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
I totally agree.

781
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,720
It's like we're putting a shining star, a beam of light up into the sky.

782
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:29,720
Uh, for anyone to use to develop and create fantastic applications with the knowledge that you're shooting kind of break one day.

783
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,720
Is there extra stuff that they're putting in there that goes above and beyond the current global positioning system?

784
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
I'd love to know.

785
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,720
I'm sure you have an idea.

786
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
Hey, Canada.

787
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,720
Canada bringing, uh, bringing in some comments now.

788
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,720
It's nice to have people in Canada listening.

789
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
All right.

790
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,720
I have a feeling there's, uh, there's a lot of, uh, consumption of independent media in Canada.

791
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Just seems like the Canadians are that way, you know what I mean?

792
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Hey, Adam, it's Kevin Colling from Ottawa.

793
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Canada's national capital.

794
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
There you go.

795
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
Uh, long time listener, first time caller.

796
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,720
Thank you.

797
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Uh, love the show.

798
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
And, like, most hate the nylon.

799
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,720
However, what's with the whole Ron Paul reach around overall the deal?

800
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
The reach around.

801
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
A few months.

802
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,720
It can be great that you've been on the drone.

803
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,720
But I don't have to say this delicately, but have you actually read his platform?

804
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Other than the whole constitutional thing, which is kind of a simple minded approach.

805
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,720
But actually, no, he's not simple minded. He certainly has strong convictions and interesting fellow.

806
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,720
But the answers to all the world's hills do not fall into the US Constitution.

807
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
Uh-huh.

808
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
That's correct.

809
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
That is absolutely correct.

810
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,720
It is also not meant as the answer to all of the world's hills.

811
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
It is meant as the blueprint for the way.

812
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,720
America's supposed to function.

813
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,720
So it's not saying that it changes all the world's hills.

814
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,720
But I think a lot of it could affect the world in a very positive way.

815
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,720
If you're looking to hire, sir, if you're looking to vote for somebody or back somebody who also.

816
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Hey, that was a great fruity.

817
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,720
If you're looking to hire, yeah, that's exactly what we do hire the guy.

818
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,720
Okay?

819
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
We are looking to hire the president.

820
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,720
It is a job interview.

821
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,720
I love that.

822
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
That's funny.

823
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
If you're looking to hire, let me hear that again.

824
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,720
That's funny.

825
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:15,720
If you're looking to hire, sir, if you're looking to vote for somebody or back somebody who also doesn't have a chance of voting or a winning.

826
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
You certainly go for a Dennis Cassinant.

827
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,720
She seems to be much more in line with your values and interests.

828
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
And he's got a hug.

829
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
You've got a hot wife.

830
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
Yes.

831
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
With a tongue piercing, no less.

832
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Yeah, I agree.

833
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,720
I have to say, I have to say that Cassinant definitely and he saw a UFO.

834
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,720
So I have to say that, and I'm not making fun of him.

835
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
I think right on to this guy.

836
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,720
You know, this is a lot of other stuff I don't like about him.

837
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,720
But yeah, right on, right on.

838
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,720
But yeah, just right on for him.

839
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,720
More in line with your values and your interests.

840
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
And he's even got a hot wife that you can ask for.

841
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Make it pictures of.

842
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
However, I don't think Ron Paul is a crackpot.

843
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
I just think he's a pro.

844
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
And more importantly, his platform is kind of out of whack.

845
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
I mean, the guy wants to abolish the UN.

846
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
You know, yeah.

847
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
Okay, I'll let you go through all these.

848
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,720
Pulling out of the UN would be horrendous for while the fairs.

849
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,720
He wants to eliminate federal government agencies,

850
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,720
which is probably not a great idea to eliminate them completely.

851
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,720
Yes, they can be inefficient, but my God, that's crazy.

852
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,720
I mean, that's not really, you know, really

853
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Robudding anything just by saying that's crazy.

854
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Okay.

855
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,720
And I think you're drawing conclusions out of the platform.

856
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
I think, you know, you're,

857
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
I don't think you're really analyzing his platform,

858
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,720
which is the Constitution.

859
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
First property rights on environment,

860
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
which means he won't do anything to help

861
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,720
environment to protect protection from a national standpoint,

862
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,720
which is horrible from an environmental standpoint.

863
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,720
You know, I think I think that you are making that up.

864
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,720
That you're saying that he won't do that.

865
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
I don't think anywhere he said,

866
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,720
I won't do this.

867
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
And also he's positioned himself.

868
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,720
I think he's really fairly positioned himself as a transition.

869
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,720
A transition from where we are to where we should be.

870
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,720
It's going to take a lot longer than the possible eight years that he could do it.

871
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
So I think that's what he's saying.

872
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,720
And consistently I've heard him say,

873
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
no, you can't just cut everyone off from everything

874
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
and change everything overnight.

875
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
It just, nothing works like that.

876
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,720
You can't snap your fingers and have all troops from 130 countries

877
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,720
around the world home.

878
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
You know, this transition, that takes years.

879
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Years and years to do that to set it up right.

880
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,720
And it's going to take a while.

881
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
It's going to take a decade for us to change course.

882
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
And we're going to get any kind of real cotton.

883
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
And that's important.

884
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,720
There's no quick fixed all this, my friend.

885
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
There is no quick fix.

886
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
There's no shortcuts.

887
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,720
It's not like, you know, you saw it with the Democrats in Congress.

888
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,720
Well, boy, that really changed everything, didn't it?

889
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
Not about that.

890
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
So I don't know.

891
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,720
All I can say is you should really take a look at his actual issues.

892
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Like how he stands on the issues because they're kind of scary.

893
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,720
If that's the approach he wants to take.

894
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Other guys on the Democratic side.

895
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,720
I know you're not on a Democrat or Republican have much different ideas.

896
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,720
That are certainly much more in line with progressive thinking.

897
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,720
I think the progressive thinking has nothing to do with the government.

898
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,720
The government has a very specific role and the progressive thinking comes from the citizens.

899
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:20,720
And we need to have the room to be progressive thinkers and to live our life as a community in a progressive way.

900
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Okay, that's not the government's role to be progressive for us.

901
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
You know, I guess to end it.

902
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,720
Oh, one last thing.

903
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
DS6A, one mad at how I'm not going to take anymore.

904
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
Absolutely loved that episode.

905
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
It was one of my favorite interests for a while.

906
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,720
So to end it, folder, sit and tinkles and fuck you, Adam Curry.

907
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
No, no, I'm sorry.

908
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
I mean, I love you, Adam Curry.

909
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,720
I mean, I love you.

910
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
Not in a gay way though.

911
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,720
Anyone more can you ask for Adam, first man, and Curry.

912
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
The best food in the planet.

913
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
Have a great day.

914
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,720
Look forward to listening to more.

915
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Take care.

916
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,720
Oh, man.

917
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,720
If you ever listened to Costa's world, we'll find it on pod joke.

918
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Go to costosworld.com, Tony Price.

919
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,720
He does his great show in Los Angeles.

920
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,720
And Andy did this one.

921
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
I've talked about it with him about it.

922
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
It's a couple of times it's really funny.

923
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,720
It's just thing that black guys will do to each other.

924
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
And I say, hey, man, I love you.

925
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
No homo.

926
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,720
It's essentially just the white guy version of it.

927
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Not in a gay way.

928
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,720
It's okay.

929
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,720
It's all okay if it's in a gay way too.

930
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,720
Don't worry about it.

931
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
I'm cool.

932
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Hello, Adam.

933
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,720
I'm time to listen.

934
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,720
First time, caller.

935
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
My name's Andy.

936
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,720
I live in Portland, Oregon.

937
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,720
I was listening to you by this in all your shows.

938
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,720
But 65, you asked about

939
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,720
So you asked for us to think about how to affect change.

940
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,720
And I just wanted to respond to your earlier comment in that show.

941
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,720
Where you say, you don't think of matters.

942
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Who's the president.

943
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:04,720
And I think that that attitude has gotten my generation.

944
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
I'm just a couple years younger than you.

945
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,720
But I think my generation of people has taken that to heart.

946
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,720
We realize that for a long time.

947
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Ever since Reagan, essentially, that doesn't matter.

948
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
Both parties are the same.

949
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
It's not a two party system.

950
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
It's a one party system.

951
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,720
And it's self defeating attitudes.

952
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,720
And I think I don't think you really think that.

953
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,720
But because you are still, you know, supporting Ron Paul.

954
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,720
And I have a problem with Ron Paul's.

955
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,720
You know, strict constitutionalism.

956
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,720
And, you know, strict property rights interpretation of the constitution.

957
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Because, you know, this is the second call about the property rights.

958
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,720
So let me know exactly what you mean by that.

959
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,720
Go in a little detail.

960
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Because I do want to understand it.

961
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,720
Because property really is at the basis and the foundation of the constitution.

962
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,720
By the way, you don't own the land that your house is on.

963
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,720
Just so you know, actually in Texas, you mind.

964
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,720
I think that's the only state left in the union where you actually can loan.

965
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,720
Can earn the actual land that your house is sitting on.

966
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,720
Which is why you pay property taxes.

967
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,720
And you don't own your car.

968
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,720
Funny enough.

969
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
This is, this is really true.

970
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
The government owns your car.

971
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,720
Okay.

972
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,720
That's why they can tax you on it.

973
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,720
It's kind of like interest for you using it.

974
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
You know, look into it.

975
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
It's really true.

976
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,720
You don't own your car even if you think you do.

977
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,720
Even if you have a certificate of title.

978
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,720
That's not an actual ownership document.

979
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,720
We could do a whole another show on that.

980
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,720
But I'd like to know what this thing is about property.

981
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,720
Please let me know.

982
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,720
The matter for this one.

983
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:59,720
I mean, is if you can get elected a third party of a person who's not a member.

984
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Or strictly other Republican or Democratic party.

985
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
But what we need in this country.

986
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,720
I think is a labor party of party.

987
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,720
You know, the thing with independence or anything outside of these two parties.

988
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,720
Of course, it would be great to have a third party or a fourth party.

989
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,720
But running as an independent, you have to be a billionaire to get on TV.

990
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,720
You know, you have to spend so much money to get into the debates, to get into the forum,

991
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,720
to get into the public forum.

992
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
It's almost impossible.

993
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
The system is truly fucked.

994
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,720
I have the people.

995
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,720
And so far, the Republicans have been that.

996
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,720
And the laborers have been behind the Republicans and their support of the war.

997
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,720
Something has to change in the attitude.

998
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,720
The other thing I want to say is your dollar is your vote.

999
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,720
Vote with your money.

1000
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,720
So, as you've been saying, follow the money.

1001
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
Well, yeah, send your money.

1002
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,720
Decide who is invested in the war and don't buy their products.

1003
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,720
I don't buy anything from GE if I can help it.

1004
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:58,720
I don't, you know, I have a few thousand dollars invested in all green investments.

1005
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,720
You have to be careful where you spend your money.

1006
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,720
And that is how the difference was made in my opinion.

1007
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,720
And I vote with my dollar.

1008
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,720
I also voted the polls.

1009
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:14,720
I try to vote for third party candidates, green candidates, libertarians and whatnot.

1010
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,720
But anyway, I just wanted to get that out to you.

1011
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,720
It's no longer a two party system.

1012
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,720
I need to say another party, a labor party in this country.

1013
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,720
And I vote with my dollar.

1014
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,720
And it sounds like you do too.

1015
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,720
And anyway, your dollar is your vote.

1016
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,720
Share your own.

1017
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,720
Yeah, I'd like that a lot.

1018
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,720
No, I'd love to.

1019
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,720
Thank you.

1020
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,720
Hey, you know, that's a good idea.

1021
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:43,720
So, since Burger King and Pizza Hut, both are involved in Iraq because I've seen it with my own two eyes.

1022
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,720
I'm not going to eat a Burger King or Pizza Hut anymore.

1023
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,720
I don't think you should either.

1024
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,720
And let's compile a list.

1025
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,720
Absolutely.

1026
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,720
That's a great way.

1027
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,720
Vote with your dollar.

1028
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,720
Wall Street talks about the mighty force of the American consumers.

1029
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,720
It's a very important number, the consumer purchasing power.

1030
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,720
The, you know, that is like five different ways they track that.

1031
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,720
Boy, that's really important, you know.

1032
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:11,720
So, what if you had the Black Friday or Cyber Monday, but it excluded a number of companies?

1033
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,720
Yeah, we do have that power.

1034
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,720
That's a great idea.

1035
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,720
Vote with your dollar.

1036
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,720
Wow.

1037
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,720
Wow.

1038
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,720
Wow.

1039
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,720
Great.

1040
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,720
We vote with our dollar by spending on the candidates we, we like.

1041
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,720
And we vote with our dollar by not spending on the companies that are basically,

1042
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,720
that's the election is against them.

1043
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,720
There you go.

1044
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,720
It's really all of the candidates running against the machine.

1045
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,720
You could call it the military industrial complex.

1046
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,720
Whatever.

1047
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,720
It's not just that, of course, but that's a big part of it.

1048
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,720
And that's a very good idea.

1049
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,720
And of course, what, what companies are attached to GE?

1050
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,720
NBC?

1051
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,720
So, we'll stop watching that.

1052
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,720
Can we really do it?

1053
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,720
Do you think you can really pull your head away from the, the box with the light?

1054
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,720
Or just a little while?

1055
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
Turn that thing off.

1056
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,720
Really?

1057
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,720
Turn the television off.

1058
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,720
Really?

1059
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,720
You're being hypnotized.

1060
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,720
Okay?

1061
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,720
Three years ago.

1062
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,720
Three years ago.

1063
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,720
I wish I could do it right now.

1064
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,720
I can't do it on command.

1065
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,720
But three years ago.

1066
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,720
I hypnotized tens of thousands of people by burping and associating

1067
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,720
the words and say oh.

1068
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,720
And today it still works.

1069
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,720
What do you know?

1070
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,720
Do you have any idea what television has been doing to your ass?

1071
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,720
Speaking of that, if you want to domain name, the cheapest way is to go to godaddy.com

1072
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,720
and use one of my checkout codes.

1073
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,720
You can find a link in the show notes to find out what the RDSC1,

1074
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,720
2 and 3 different great deals.

1075
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,720
Wait, don't stop.

1076
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,720
I got to hypnotize you next about Sony headphones.

1077
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,720
They're awesome.

1078
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,720
Go to Sony.com slash headphones.

1079
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,720
And then there's the San Diego Hard Rock Cafe that is opening up.

1080
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,720
And your band could be performing live on stage with black.

1081
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,720
Black piece, black eyed piece with the hell is it?

1082
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,720
Black piece.

1083
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,720
I did a shitty job at hypnotizing you today.

1084
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,720
I'm sorry.

1085
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,720
And of course, be on the lookout for the Nokia N800 10 link.

1086
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,720
It should be in well in time for you to order it for Christmas.

1087
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,720
I, from what I understand, we're just waiting on the codes.

1088
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,720
Can't wait.

1089
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,720
I really can't wait.

1090
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,720
Hi, everybody.

1091
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,720
Let's wrap it up with one more.

1092
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,720
It's actually took me a little longer than I thought.

1093
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,720
But boy, there was a good bunch of comments in there.

1094
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,720
And it really helped because I just,

1095
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,720
I just don't have the energy to talk too much.

1096
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,720
Mr. Curri, you self-guide Germany.

1097
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:38,720
Do you think that Gary Alexander could get a slightly overweight 31-year-old

1098
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,720
Always in the car sitting, that Donald's beating skills guy

1099
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,720
in shape to do a round of fighting with one of his fighters.

1100
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:54,720
If so, also interested in following this with a camera

1101
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,720
and making a soap out of it could be kind of funny.

1102
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,720
I am looking for a trainer.

1103
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,720
Gary Alexander, if you can help me, let me know.

1104
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,720
I like to fight around for soup.

1105
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,720
Just be for Germany.

1106
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,720
I don't care.

1107
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,720
I don't care.

1108
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,720
Let's leave it to you.

1109
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,720
Alright, Gary Alexander.

1110
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,720
I know he listens to the show,

1111
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,720
or the ultimate podcast.

1112
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,720
I wouldn't want to follow you around,

1113
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,720
but I bet you Gary could make a pretty fun show out of it.

1114
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,720
See, some Dutch sales guy in Germany getting his ass kicked.

1115
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,720
Yeah, I'll be down with that.

1116
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,720
Alright, everybody.

1117
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,720
I appreciate you listening.

1118
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,720
Hope it didn't bore you too much.

1119
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,720
Hope you enjoyed the comments.

1120
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,720
As always, Adam at podshow.com.

1121
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,720
DailySourceco.com.

1122
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,720
And if I keep my shit together, literally,

1123
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,720
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1124
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,720
Another podshow podcast.

1125
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,720
Stick it in your ear.

1126
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,720
Imagine headphones without wires.

1127
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,720
Now, their Sony's Bluetooth wireless headset.

1128
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,720
A rechargeable listening experience

1129
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,720
with 11 hours of music playback.

1130
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,720
You and your music are free to move.

1131
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,720
Pick up yours at Sony.com-headphones.

1132
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,720
Sony wireless headphones.

1133
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,720
Your music are unplugged.
