1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey Peter, can I ask you a question?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yes, do you?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Who would you say our calls important?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
After 20 minutes of being on hold, I'd have to say now.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Please continue to hold.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Your call is important to us.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, it's very correct.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's very important.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then we'll hold music.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Uniflight communications.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Our bus is going.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Delta Sierra Charlie, five three four.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
To this, we can't keep headed home.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I can't take this anymore.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Out of all this, I just need you to go.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I can't seem to have really let you go.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're not moving on.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Don't take the older arms again and back.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You're like a king on you.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't take the older arms on my knees.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm still holding on

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Memories are around

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Keep me standing here

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can't move on

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's easy

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Tell me everything on you

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Are you wanting

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What's for me to tell the truth

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
None of them

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You don't think all around

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Take it away

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Feels like I'm dead

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You don't think all around

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
How long I need

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm still holding on

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
There got a good sense

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You really don't feel inside of you

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm still holding on

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm still holding on

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I just need you to go

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I can't seem to

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm real

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You don't think all around

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Take it away

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Feels like I'm dead

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You don't think all around

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
How long I need

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm still holding on

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You don't think all around

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You don't think all around

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You don't think all around

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm a sucker for the big power cords

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Man let me tell you

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Point to reason from the pod said music network

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
PMN

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't say it's over

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm still holding on

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm still holding on

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm still holding on

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm still holding on

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm still holding on

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm still holding on

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm still holding on

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm still holding on

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm still holding on

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm still holding on

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm still holding on

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm still holding on

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm still holding on

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm still holding on

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm still holding on

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm still holding on

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm still holding on

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm still holding on

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm still holding on

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Get ready

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
John

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Jesus

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Lutin

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Just as we're all debaraging

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,720
the final bits of an interview Patricia was doing for some medical program in in the Netherlands,

86
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,400
which is about coping with illnesses. And so, you know, kind of conked out last night,

87
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,640
but not after watching the finale, the grand finale of Celebrity Big Brother for 2007, the winner

88
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:44,120
was the the Bollywood actress, Shilpa Shetty. And of course, quite interesting because, you know,

89
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,720
they were all they were saying, they kept repeating it yesterday, by the way, in the show,

90
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,840
about this international incident, the racism occurring in the Celebrity Big Brother house.

91
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,680
Well, first of all, let me just play this piece of feedback for you.

92
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,720
I don't choose Newcastle, UK England, the world. And, yeah, I'm just putting my little two pennies

93
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:13,480
in the dead, or Jade Goody, for what a shame. Short of, you know, from you, I'd with a press

94
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,840
over the other side of the water, with your daughter. If you get yourself in this Celebrity,

95
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,600
you're pretty much, in that circumstance, you're pretty much asking for what you get. Jade Goody isn't

96
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:32,840
racist, she's thick, and there's a big difference. She's not intelligent enough to cope with Celebrity.

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,240
There might not be a lot of people over there who are celebrities who are mega-intelligence,

98
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,320
but she's just never been right for it. She's been pushed from, from pillar to poster, you know,

99
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,600
from these, they're trying to be words of an officer, you know. She's been pushed around to

100
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,760
these agencies, you know, and Max Clifford, I think, looked after her, and was a big publicist.

101
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,720
She's just not right for it. But one thing I did want to say is this puts out a very big message.

102
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,680
A lot of said she's not racist, she's just thick. She is a bully, and I imagine I've been a

103
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,360
bully when she was at school, and it just put out a very good message to kids around the world,

104
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,040
is that when people face up a police, generally speaking, the will, the will crumble,

105
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,400
bullies are just cowards, and that's what Jade Goody's proved, that when she's been confronted

106
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,080
by the rest of the, you know, of the same worlds, to say, well, Adam and I, you can't go on like that

107
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,960
what people, it's not fair, and it's not right. She turns into a cumble in that in Christ. So,

108
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,960
you know, that's, anyway, that's where I wanted to say, I was bullied at school as well,

109
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:38,760
and police are just a bunch of nasty little cowards, simply. See you later.

110
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,160
All right, James. So, yeah, no, you know, I agree with James, which, of course, is why I played

111
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,680
as audio comment. I didn't see any racist behavior, and we have to be very careful what kind of

112
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,920
language we deem as racism. And by the way, is language actually the definition of racism?

113
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,800
It's certainly not nice, the things that were said, let me, let me look that up for you while we're

114
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,840
doing that. I was going to go to my, it's one of the sites that I've gone to for my entire life,

115
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,200
almost, or as long as it's been available, dictionary.com, I love it. Let's just look up racism,

116
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,960
because I, I think it doesn't read the, that true definition, what should we do, race,

117
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:24,040
racism or racist? I wonder. Let's see what racism. Oh, I misspelled it. Here we go. Well,

118
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,480
I'm not stupid, but I forgot the A kind of necessary when you're spelling racism. Let's see now,

119
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,920
a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races determine cultural

120
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,360
or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own racist superior and has the

121
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:48,440
right to rule others. See, that's what I understood racism to be as well. Although, let's see,

122
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,960
the second definition of policy system of government, etc. based on or fostering such a doctrine,

123
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,040
discrimination, hatred or intolerance of another race or races,

124
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:08,520
maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe. But, you know, it just sounded like what was happening is people were

125
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:21,080
using, I were using a different line, different accents or or different appearances to hurt them

126
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,280
in a, in a conversation, but racism, I think, really is something else. So I agree with your James

127
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,960
about this, about J. Goody, not being a racist, but she is, it's thick. That's a good one, thick.

128
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:40,120
For her, that is particularly applicable, I think. So, you know, hopefully, I love this stuff.

129
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,840
I can't wait for them to do more of this because the more reality get, we get the more pornographic

130
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:53,240
it is. Anyways, I'll show up a shitty one. And of course, you've got to wonder if this

131
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,800
controversy hadn't been there, would she want or not? It doesn't really matter. But when she

132
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,440
came out and I wish, we don't have the sky HD box yet or any of the sky box is the guy comes

133
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:09,320
tomorrow, if he can find the place, right? So I don't have a recording of it, but she said something.

134
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,440
She just, the words came out so beautifully, or she said, look, I didn't feel any racism. I don't

135
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,200
think J. Goody is a racist. We're all, as human beings, we're all valuable. She had a lot of

136
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,760
really good one-liner zinger nuggets in there. And she said, I'm very proud that the people of Britain

137
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,520
have chosen me as the winner. And I don't think that Jade reflects bad on the United Kingdom.

138
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,080
I mean, and she, I don't think she had any outside contact with it. They're in the big brother house.

139
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,360
So she really didn't even know how big this had become and certainly in the press in the UK.

140
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,960
And she was very, very eloquent. Maybe I can find it, you know, that's typical something on

141
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,880
YouTube that might be available. I'll see if I can find that for you. It was just a beautiful quote

142
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,560
the way she said it. Okay, big show today. Lots of feedback. Thank you very much for calling

143
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,600
into the, into the voicemail lines, which means most of what we're going to be talking about

144
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,000
today comes from that. Except for one thing I've been holding on to because I knew that this

145
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,880
were required some piece and quiet and some sitting downtime. Now that I'm back at the, back

146
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:20,360
at the cottage, I'm using the homemade bill desk. So I'm doing the show sitting down very different.

147
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:27,480
You know, I like to stand up when I do it, but Amy Mac has got me sitting today. What are we

148
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:36,200
doing, baby? Come on in. Amy, I'm back. Hey, baby, how you doing? Tell me how much you missed me.

149
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:42,440
I missed you so much. Oh, I missed you, too. Okay, what do we get started? I did want to send my condolences

150
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,240
for Trinity. Well, I can't say I'm surprised, but nonetheless, it's always hard to say goodbye.

151
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,040
Not completely dead yet, you know. And what's up with this evening recording thing? I don't

152
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,800
know if the mood calls for exercise. Yeah, that's why I'm going to anyway. Okay. All right,

153
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,560
what are we doing? You're going to need a chair for this week exercise. Right, I'm sitting.

154
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,680
A chair with no arms and a flat seat is fat. Okay, no arms. You're going to lay down in your stomach

155
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,320
over the seat of the chair. Holy crap. Now you're going to balance on the chair. Yes. You can put

156
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,720
your hands before or grab the legs of the chair. Yeah, my hands, he's reached easily. You're going to

157
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,600
raise and lower your legs. Okay. It's not a huge movement, but you should be lifting the legs just

158
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,240
higher than the hips and squeezing that butt. Like this. And then lower them keeping it controlled

159
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:33,000
and then raise and squeeze again. Oh, Amy, you're going to do 12. Ready, go. Okay, one, keep your head

160
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,280
in neutral position. Three, four, you should only be moving about a foot up and down. Do you do that

161
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:53,480
five? Don't let your back arch. Keep breathing. Good job. I'm going to get back up. All right,

162
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,360
look back to your evening on the odds. If you get a chance, check out my new video show. There's

163
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,680
a hot topic and move the week. I even teach how to prepare a pomegranate. Take a look at fitlife.podshow.com.

164
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,120
Well, it's good to be back and I have a lot of new exercising moves for you. Okay.

165
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:19,240
So until next time. Thanks, Amy. I didn't know that she had a video show, fitlife.podshow.com.

166
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,800
Let me just go take a look for a second. Yeah, I felt that in the gluteous maximus region for sure.

167
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:34,600
Fitlife. What you said, fitlife.podshow.com? Oh, so the DSL is hooked up. Hey, how often does that

168
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,560
happen? When the company tells you, well, you know, first you have 15 days of disconnection,

169
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,800
then you have to call up and they'll take another five to ten working days to get reconnected.

170
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,400
Patricia said they called and said, you're connected, Mrs. Curry. And, you know, I came back. I plugged

171
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:56,520
in the router. I plugged in the airport and cabawi. I've got the bandwidth. Loving it here,

172
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,600
fit for life. Nice, Amy. Let me just see what she looks like in the video.

173
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:08,840
By the way, I'm such a dick. I was before celebrity big brother came on. I was watching some

174
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:17,640
DVDs with the kids, the kids being Christina and Andy. He's almost like a son to me now.

175
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:26,200
What the hell? One, two. Did you hear that? Sorry to crackle up. And, of course, I missed the return

176
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:33,320
of top gear on the BBC, Richard Hammond, they showed his accident. And that's another thing

177
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,400
when I have to go. I guess go look at YouTube, see if it can find it there or maybe there's something

178
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:43,480
on London BBC. I can find a repeat. But, oh, man, can't believe I missed that. Such a dork.

179
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,120
All right, Amy, I'm waiting for your show to come in. It doesn't seem, doesn't seem to be happening.

180
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,320
Okay. Well, we'll leave that for what it is for right now. If it starts to happen, I'll let you know.

181
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,400
I don't, it's James again. Hey, James. No, the message. And, not, not the sound like I've been

182
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,760
plagiaristic that I would. And, because I have just heard this suggestion, I did actually,

183
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:14,120
after I came up with Adam's hunting aboard. I did sort of think, what about, say, I think.

184
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,320
Welcome to, he says, Eric, what if, rather, do you see, you know, something like that? I don't know.

185
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,720
I did actually think of it, so he's not like the way back. I don't know. That sounds like I'm really

186
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,400
copying this. And I'm really, honestly, I'm not suppose. But they go. Just like Adam's attic.

187
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,120
Yeah, you know, that kind of works. And it is kind of something I got to figure out now because

188
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,920
now that we have the DSL. Now, I'm going to configure all of the wireless access. And it has to

189
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,320
have a name. You know, that's the most important place to identify is on the name of your wireless

190
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:54,040
access point. You know, it's, so currently I haven't set the curry cottage. Let me see,

191
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:02,440
I got a couple of emails here about that. Who's this from? Jessica, I have a few naming suggestions

192
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,120
for your family's new domicile. How about curry manner? It's a bit more upscale than cottage.

193
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,080
Not quite as grand as castle. If you have your heart set on a little duration, you could try

194
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:21,080
pod show polotto. I think it would be Patricia's polotto before it would be the pod show

195
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,960
polotto. I do have some experience in the naming field. I guess I came up with a name for my parents

196
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:32,280
cottage. Blake's Lake estate estate is also nice, isn't it? Curry manner, though, that does have a nice

197
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,920
ring. It doesn't have the alliteration stuff. I like so much Jessica Anderson from Gainesville, Florida.

198
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:44,520
But I think that, you know, that's kind of sticking for me. Now, what do we have here? Jersey Todd,

199
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,240
okay, he says the game ends right now. I've heard all the suggestions. Here's mine. The curry

200
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:58,520
quarry, the place where rock lives. He's been even written like little liners and stuff,

201
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,960
podcasting from the curry quarry where we dig the raw rock from the ground and get it to you,

202
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,720
fresh. Hey Todd, man, don't quit the day job, baby. I had him park you checking in again with a

203
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:19,160
with a suggestion for the name of the new curry place and gulfed about the curry colony. I figured

204
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,360
that would be nice because of the American connection and it all wants to be there. So it's quite

205
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:31,160
a few people making a colony. How about the curry colony? Take a bus. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know.

206
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,960
You know, it sounds okay, but then you look at it and you see the word colon jumping out at you.

207
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:43,560
It just doesn't quite work from me. So let me know. You know how to reach me, no?

208
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:59,080
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven, last one, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

209
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,400
You know, I often wonder which number people in the UK called. Do you call the plus one number? Or do you

210
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
call this number?

211
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,400
Okay, we're going to talk about Trinity in just a couple minutes. This is something that

212
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,240
came in though that was a bit disturbing to hear. Hey, this is Chris and Hager's town.

213
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:39,320
I was calling the ask you about songs no longer allowed on podcast. Podcasts,

214
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,840
safe songs on the podcast. Music network because I'm going through the songs to add them to my

215
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,880
podcast and one that I played before, I went to go play again and now it says, it's ghosted out.

216
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,880
It says, not allow for podcasts. So why are they even on the podcast? Music network.

217
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,800
Anyway, how do you start? You know, I'm a Latino talk to you later, five.

218
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,760
Yeah, so I appreciate you telling me that. I have not seen this myself, so it was interesting,

219
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:12,600
yet very unhelpful at the same time. Like, what was this maybe? Is that my, what is that?

220
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,120
Is that my, my headset or is that something else? I don't know if you can hear that. My left,

221
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,760
time to left channel cut out for a second there. Anyway, what song was it? Could you please

222
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,920
give me a little more information? It wouldn't make any sense to have a song up there. There's

223
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,160
not available for play on podcasting on podcasts or for other people who have signed the license.

224
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,760
It is, of course, entirely possible that the artist took his song off, his or her or whatever,

225
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,240
whomever song it is, they, you know, they can take it off whenever they want that doesn't mean by the

226
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,880
way that you have to get rid of any work that you've used the song in because that remains

227
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,520
in perpetuity if you read the license, you'll see that. But tell me which one it is. And we're

228
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:00,120
looking to it because that does not sound, uh, doesn't, doesn't, doesn't sound, uh, shit, it doesn't sound

229
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:09,400
like this. It's time once again. She's gonna go. She's gonna blow.

230
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,920
Everybody know that this is gonna be the better way. All right, everybody.

231
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:35,560
The Trinity, Trinity, the quintessential luxury, Trinity, Trinity, let the bio diesel set you bring,

232
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:42,760
Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity. She free Trinity, she save the world, win valuable prizes.

233
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,720
Yep, Trinity is going on a road trip. And let me tell you, uh, we had her towed out of the

234
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:54,920
Podshow HQ parking lot last week, and taken to the garage, where she was repaired. Guess what?

235
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,960
We saw the work order for this thing. I don't know what kind of garage Rosie took Trinity to,

236
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,800
but it said like, Kano start. Okay, Kano start. They replaced the battery, which was nothing

237
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:12,600
wrong with the battery. I think it, I had a brand new battery. Dickheads. So 200 bucks for a new

238
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,680
battery, and then they cleaned out all the fuel lines and everything. Rosie picked the car up,

239
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,920
and she tried to bring her back to the office and the same thing happened again. It caulked out.

240
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,920
So Trinity's back in the shop. We're gonna get her running. And the deal that I've made with Rosie

241
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,800
is as soon as she's up and running, Rosie's gonna drive it in from, uh, into work every single day.

242
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,120
She's gonna use it to keep her running, because we gotta keep it all the parts moving. You know, we can't

243
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,120
kick off this whole thing, and then all of a sudden have no Trinity, you know, have her not running. So

244
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,480
I'm gearing up on my end. I'm getting ready to, getting ready to put her on the road.

245
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,320
Hello? It all started when Jersey Todd told me about this podcast called Blarman. This girl had

246
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,840
broken up with her boyfriend. So I received this email from a girl named Nicole from a podcast called

247
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:05,720
Missing Something. And she just broken up with her boyfriend, too. And I was so touched by Dana's

248
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:11,880
story that I sent her an email. And we haven't stopped talking since. So I emailed her back,

249
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,400
feeling thankful that there was somebody else in the universe who was sort of feeling what I was.

250
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,880
If laughter's the best medicine this girl's been my doctor for the past few months.

251
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,640
And if it wasn't for Nicole, I would have gone insane months ago. But we can't be kept apart.

252
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,960
And so Dana's already coming to New York in May. And I've been trying to plot and plan a

253
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:40,040
scheme to take a road trip up to St. John's to see her. So pictures and chatting and long emails are

254
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,760
great. But I want more. I want Nicole to come and visit me in St. John's Newfoundland.

255
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,520
And let me, let me just interject you for a second. So here's two girls who found each other

256
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,360
apparently through the pod show podcast network. And who are communicating quite a lot, they

257
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:02,440
have in common that they have no men. And they love each other. I'm going to show her a good time.

258
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:09,320
I want to be there for her driver's test or for her first road trip in a car. And I would love

259
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,600
for it to be Trinity. I'd love for it to be biodiesel. I'd love to experience biodiesel so I can

260
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:21,080
get behind it. And I just love the idea of this big town girl coming to visit me, this small town

261
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:27,080
girl out here on this rock in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. For years I've been working on

262
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,760
transitioning my life to be more toward the cause of sustainable and renewable energy.

263
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,560
And yeah, I'm all for the environment, but I just really want to meet Nicole. And so you've got

264
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,640
two pod show podcasters united by this strange medium as it is. So I'm just going to interject

265
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,520
real quickly. If you're listening to this on serious stars 102 go to dailysourceco.com and download

266
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:55,640
the rest because YouTube could participate in the free Trinity coast to coast run. Save the world

267
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,440
valuable prizes. And yet about a thousand miles apart, what better away to bridge that gap than

268
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,480
Trinity. So now you have to bruised and battered and slate your heart broken, but brand new and positive

269
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:16,360
podcasters trying to find a way to meet each other. Brute bruised and battered? Oh man,

270
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,120
how do you girl sound like fun? It seems to me that a Trinity is the absolute perfect way.

271
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:28,040
And maybe we'll even tell you how a part of our therapy has been sending each other naked pictures.

272
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:37,880
So, oh. Oh man. Did I hear that right? Let me just roll it back a little bit.

273
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,960
Fricked way. And maybe we'll even tell you how a part of our therapy has been sending each other naked

274
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,760
pictures. Yeah, so Adam, you and podcasting have allowed Nicole and me to connect. And Adam,

275
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,380
you and your ideas of sending naked pictures. Well, that's made us feel better about

276
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,820
ourselves. But now maybe you and Trinity can actually bring me in the call together

277
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:09,000
in real life. Can I take pictures of that? Please? Okay girls. Hey, this sounds great.

278
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,640
You know, we're trying to figure out how to get Trinity from West Coast to East

279
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,080
Coast and perhaps from the West Coast over to Europe. And I think it would be great

280
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:23,680
for Trinity to take a little diversion up north. Certainly if naked pictures are involved.

281
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,840
Hello Adam. My name is Yuna. I'm a 20 year old architect to just return from a couple

282
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,640
of years living in Georgia's London. So I kind of know where you are. And I just have a

283
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:40,520
comment about Trinity's story. I was wondering why on earth do you always have to turn

284
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,040
everything into something commercial? I know your business guy and it's a very good

285
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,720
visit. But I'm also very aware of that the way you do business is that you try to push

286
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,520
people to do something very new. Push. But the Trinity thing, the guy was just having

287
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:03,200
a father's son's story and you just tried to make it so commercial. Do it great. Just give

288
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,000
you the break. Thanks. Well, you know, I don't know what you're calling from. You sound

289
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:17,600
Dutch actually. But you know, turning this into something commercial, that's not a fair

290
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,680
characterization of what I'm trying to do. You know, if President Bush had been smart and

291
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:35,280
had waged the war for the independence of oil instead of a war in Iraq or a war against

292
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,400
terrorism, if he just said, you know what, we're going to be independent from oil from other

293
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,120
countries. You know, it would have been a whole different and by the way, if you mess with the oil

294
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,760
we have now, we'll kick your ass. Excuse me, since I was splinter. It would have been a whole

295
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,480
different situation we're in right now. And I truly believe that this biodiesel thing is catching

296
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,080
on. You know, I talked to people a lot about it. They they talked to me about it. And as far as I

297
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,760
can tell, people find it very interesting. Look, it may not be the cheapest solution. But just

298
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,400
about everyone says, Hey, man, I'd rather give some guys in Berkeley who have a garage filled with

299
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:22,480
bio with biodiesel. I'd rather give them two and a half bucks per gallon to fill up my car than

300
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,680
I would to be oil companies. And it makes a lot of sense. And, you know, it's a very American thing.

301
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,680
So to make a lot of noise for this and to draw attention to this has nothing to do with, uh,

302
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,960
with commercialism. And by the way, you know, the, the Doug Pilgrim's offer to drive Trinity back

303
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,320
over a week was fantastic. It sparked off a lot of ideas, but I'd like to get more attention for it.

304
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,160
I want you as a today to write about it. You know, about this eggnog colored Mercedes 300 turbo

305
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,400
diesel five cylinder station wagon from 1984 cruising on biodiesel surrounded by all these other

306
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,840
biodiesel vehicles trucking across the United States of America. I want people to know about that.

307
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,880
And the fact that not only can we do this, that there is independence of foreign oil and that people

308
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,760
are, you know, little initiatives are sprouting up left and right. You know, let's get Willie Nelson

309
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,600
involved with his biodiesel. We'll stop at a couple of his stations, even though they're mixed biodiesel.

310
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,760
It's a damn good start. You know, draw some attention to it. And at the same time, you know,

311
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,880
draw some attention to what we're doing that independent media can make a difference.

312
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:36,960
Hi, um, uh, blah, blah, blah. Big brother reality TV shows, blah, blah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm looking

313
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,320
to, uh, yeah, see something something something yesterday. Um, talking about Trinity and you're

314
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,160
bladding on and I lost concentration. You're saying something about driving it around with a

315
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,400
some voter phone, but it was not here boxed by the, something like that. Yeah, great. I'd be cool.

316
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:56,640
Still I'm still my other dudes with this time, I've got my vote. Um, but I've got a quick question.

317
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:07,360
I think biodiesel, um, can you only run biodiesel through it? Can you put a regular diesel through it?

318
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,360
Because that would clear out the pipes. And if you're driving only a hundred miles before

319
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,760
swapping over, can you get some town to town in the state? I exactly. So first of all, the

320
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,920
answer to your question is yes, any conventional diesel engine you have. Certainly in any modern

321
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,800
vehicle, you can put biodiesel right in it. No conversion necessary. Don't need to change anything.

322
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:37,280
Trinity's case because it's an older car in 1984. I think anything around that period or early

323
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,160
has to have different hosing and different tubing installed. And maybe that's part of the problem,

324
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:50,080
by the way, because the viscosity of vegetable oil is very different from the petroleum based diesel oil.

325
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,240
And it starts to break down the hoses and stuff. And so that crap is very, it's a very good chance.

326
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,280
That's what's happening, by the way. That's what's getting into the fuel line.

327
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,000
Interestingly enough, you cannot buy a diesel powered automobile in the state of California.

328
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,280
Anyway, the answer there is yes.

329
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:15,200
100 miles, the town's town where you would actually get to a place where they sold biodiesel.

330
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,280
So that's what we're going to find out.

331
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:23,520
Really, a logistics question. It's just the question really about my, you know, just show my ignorance

332
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,600
of the states. And that's one of the reasons why I want to go and drive across the state.

333
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,840
I suppose I should drive across Europe first, but, um,

334
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
it's not as warm in places. Anyway, the other thing is to sort of bridge versus the bridge question.

335
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,360
All right, so first of all, yeah, that, that will be the thing that we're looking to figure out

336
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,720
is can you do it? Can you drive 100 miles or do we need to make it 50? Or do we need to make it

337
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,040
300 miles? Whatever it is. I think that we have, there's a pretty good chance if we

338
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,520
mapped it out that you could probably drive 100 miles a day and you could go from town to town

339
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,000
and you would never have to get any conventional diesel oil.

340
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,840
I'm, I have a feeling that's actually possible. There's certainly cool to find out and to bring

341
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,480
attention to it if it is so. And if not, then we have some work to do. Trinity can keep on

342
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,080
trucking until it's done. I mean, I'm in arguments with someone who says that the word

343
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:23,040
X isn't the word. As in, uh, I had some potatoes. Um, but he says it knows H, I ate some potatoes.

344
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,320
Why I said to date, I don't know. Anyway, if anyone could tell me, it's spelled A, T, E,

345
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:35,280
so it's spelled A, but I've always understood that you can use the word at, uh, in, in place of

346
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,800
A, because it sounds nicer and it may well be a pre-all post-to-tenth something, you know,

347
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,160
put, put, put, put, put it there, present or pastend. I'm not sure. I'm not an, I'm not an, an English

348
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:54,960
graduate, but some, I like this message. Have your good, Charles from London, say goodbye.

349
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:04,720
Thanks, Charles. If you call up drunk again, man. Uh, what am I saying? I think it's eight.

350
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,160
You know, for a country that prides itself on, uh, on originating the language. And I must say,

351
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,520
for a country that has such extensive vocabulary use of the English language,

352
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,640
you guys got a lot of weird slang going on. I've heard that at, at that. No, I think it's eight.

353
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,800
I don't think there's any, any other way to pronounce it. But of course, language is allowed to

354
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,600
change and morph. Nothing wrong with that. Uh, something else I was hearing on Big Brother yesterday,

355
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:41,600
the use of the word sat. It was really interesting. Uh, uh, I'd have to go look at it again.

356
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,320
If it comes up again, I'll come back to you on it because, yeah, there is some weird uses of, uh,

357
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,040
of the English language. Okay. So for Trinity, back to free Trinity, we want to get her on the road.

358
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,720
We need to get things scheduled. And of course, help come it from the Lord.

359
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,440
Hi Adam. It's Neil Faulk and you today. Uh, just calling to say, um,

360
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,240
wouldn't mind having a chat with you when you're back. You're back here. We're done in the free

361
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,720
Trinity project. Uh, with a view to possibly helping to project manage, making it happen.

362
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,040
So if you're in Turkey, I think you've got my details, but it's not, um, Neil Dixon knows how to

363
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,720
get hold of me. Um, yeah, we're done with, uh, would appreciate your opportunity to talk about it. So,

364
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:28,240
uh, hope you have a safe flight home. Uh, take care. Talk to you later. All right, Neil, fantastic.

365
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,160
I appreciate it very much. Yes, I will get in touch with you because we need to get this thing rolling.

366
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,160
We need to get Trinity on the road for the coast to coast tour.

367
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,720
time today.

368
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,640
I'll figure out, I'll watch you go. Let me never be buying a home. If this is going to be

369
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,760
the better way.

370
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:01,740
Trinity, Trinity, the quintessential luxury, Trinity, Trinity, left the bio diesel, set your

371
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:08,040
brain, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, she free Trinity, she saved the world,

372
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,800
When valuable prizes, all right.

373
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Let's see, we get this thing wrapped up pretty soon,

374
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,240
you know, like this week, so we can get started.

375
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,280
I'm tired of just talking about it.

376
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh, one thing I wanted to remind you about,

377
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,720
we've talked about this show on,

378
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,160
on Potio Plus Bolivian Rhapsody.

379
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,000
So the first episode or actually the Bolivian episode

380
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
is now up, it's like a 30 minute documentary,

381
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,920
and it includes Mike Del Farrow,

382
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,520
who is this fantastic musician,

383
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,040
a music musician, musician, musician, musician, musician.

384
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,640
And if you like combination of music styles,

385
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,040
particularly from worlds you've never heard before,

386
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,480
I mean, this is not like a sting thing,

387
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,040
you know, where it's like plates in the lips

388
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,200
and really complicated, you know,

389
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,240
this is like intricate jazz and folk,

390
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,400
and you've got to check it out,

391
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,880
but it's also about the kids and education in Bolivia,

392
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,400
and it's a fantastic project.

393
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,000
You want to find out more about it.

394
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,280
Go to BolivianRhapsody.potio.com.

395
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,840
I'll put a link on the show,

396
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,240
no, it's a daily source code.com

397
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,240
because it's a bitch to spell Bolivian Rhapsody

398
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,480
with an H in there.

399
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,640
So I think the Himean Rhapsody

400
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,320
except it's Bolivian, Bolivian.

401
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,720
And I think you really enjoy it.

402
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,320
I gotta get that thing in rotation,

403
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,480
get it on the home page.

404
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,520
And we have time for, let me see if we have time

405
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,120
for wanting it, what do we add now?

406
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,280
Oh yeah, let me just open up one more conversation here.

407
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,040
I think I've handedly said,

408
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,240
maybe Thursday or Friday,

409
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,800
that isn't an amazing how medical companies

410
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,240
are so incredibly targeted with their ad buys,

411
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,080
and I know exactly when everyone has these particular types

412
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,720
of fevers and colds and viruses,

413
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,160
and they have the product and the solution right there for you.

414
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,680
I'm not trying to insinuate anything,

415
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,120
but there are apparently some viruses going around

416
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,240
to the United States.

417
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,400
Hey Adam, this is Jeff from Northern Michigan.

418
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,960
Just let's then see your DSB533,

419
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,640
and you are wondering about

420
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,400
sicknesses that we're going through.

421
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,880
It's been kind of country-wise,

422
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,520
but not so widespread that it's necessarily

423
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,360
an epidemic.

424
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,760
Still, as several viruses go around,

425
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,560
one is more like a severe cold sort of flu,

426
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,160
and then there's another one, a normal virus.

427
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
Sometimes people hear about the normal virus,

428
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,200
it makes people stick on the ship,

429
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,440
or it's big call for stomach flu.

430
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,960
There's been a version of that running around here as well.

431
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,440
Here in North Michigan, my wife and daughter were talented

432
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,840
for about a week or so.

433
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,200
That's probably about a month ago,

434
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,360
and it's been, you know, as anything goes with our,

435
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,200
it's my world with trains and trains and automobiles.

436
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
I think it all over the place.

437
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Anyways, just thought I'd share that with you.

438
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,840
Former, clear.

439
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,000
Of course, you're a folder, man.

440
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,720
That's why you didn't get the severe flu.

441
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,880
Now, I'm pretty much convinced that folders are less sick.

442
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,200
Yep.

443
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,360
And so, okay, so we've got some distinct viruses.

444
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,240
You just wonder how they get into the air.

445
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,320
Yeah, where do they come from?

446
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,480
They just, all of a sudden, they pop up?

447
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,880
You know, or they couldn't be that they were fabricated

448
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
or could they?

449
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,040
Hmm.

450
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,960
On the way back in the, in the upper class lounge,

451
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Virgin Atlantic at the San Francisco International,

452
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,040
I bumped into Jan and John from Magnetoon.

453
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,240
I had a nice little chat with them,

454
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,200
and man, they're really positive about stuff going on.

455
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,680
And they live, I guess they have a place in San Francisco

456
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,520
and a place in London.

457
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,200
And so we, we just talked a little bit about Podsac music

458
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,200
and I'm pretty sure I'm not sure all of what they've got.

459
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,760
I'm Magnetoon, but I know I've played some tracks.

460
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,320
And, you know, they talked about uploading the catalog

461
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,600
to the Podsac music network.

462
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
So, it's very cool.

463
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,280
And it was just, it was nice to see people

464
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,840
have exactly the same vision.

465
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,200
I'll just from a, from a different vantage point.

466
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,640
Because as you know, Pod show is about,

467
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,480
let's get the artist everything they can.

468
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,080
All we want is a capability for producers

469
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,560
of independent media podcasters to be able to, you know,

470
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,920
fill up their shows with great music.

471
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,440
And there's a little bit more to it.

472
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,000
What I call the social reward, which works both ways.

473
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,600
It's great when an artist hears their song played.

474
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,880
Cause, you know, it's like someone saying

475
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,600
to the 1000 of their friends or in the case of this show,

476
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
several 1000 of your friends saying,

477
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,440
hey, I really like this stuff.

478
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,280
It's cool.

479
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,440
And it makes you feel really good.

480
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,560
And it makes me feel good besides playing

481
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,000
in all this fantastic music is, well,

482
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,120
when you hear back from the artist.

483
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,920
I have them, this is Melanie Lewis,

484
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,280
calling in from London a very cold London

485
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,480
where we have snow and everything this week.

486
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,440
But I just wanted to say thank you for warming me right up

487
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,080
by playing my track revelation on your show.

488
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,240
It was great to hear it.

489
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,360
And it was really good to know that it got you up

490
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,000
on your feet and moving.

491
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,240
It's a shame we can't see that.

492
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,080
I've got to be away.

493
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,680
Maybe technology will move on, but until then,

494
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,200
I have another track on the podcast

495
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,600
and music network called Satisfymey.

496
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,680
And it might not make you dance,

497
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,440
but I'll be very interested to hear

498
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
what it does inspire you to do.

499
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,280
So let me know, because I'll be listening out.

500
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,840
Loving you show, can you put the good work, Mr.

501
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,280
And thanks again.

502
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,120
Okay.

503
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,960
I love it how you save Mr. Well, Melanie.

504
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,600
Maybe we should hook up at the shortage office

505
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,640
one of these days.

506
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,960
Come on, who's honored or something like that.

507
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,960
I'll tell you what this song motivated me to do.

508
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,320
You're satisfied, Melanie.

509
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,720
Let me sing into the sea.

510
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,680
But every little bit of you.

511
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,760
Watch me get care about the rain.

512
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,040
So I'll win you in a good way.

513
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
Down home.

514
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,120
Yes, it's true.

515
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,360
I'm in danger by you.

516
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,640
You're making it so intense.

517
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,280
Don't tease it if you're eager to please.

518
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,920
You have my full consent.

519
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,240
Yeah, it's funny.

520
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,720
Just say it's funny.

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,480
Yes, that is funny, babe.

Just see your immerse for me.

524
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:54,560
Underneath I've ever heard of you.

525
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,800
You miss women and resty.

526
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:07,280
Nothing here could ever be too much.

527
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,640
I've been the crowd to you been circling around.

528
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,840
We should know on your ending.

529
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,560
Right now, you got me on the ground.

530
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,960
Make that funnel disappear.

531
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,360
Just say it's funny.

532
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,200
Just say it's funny.

Where do I go now?

536
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,360
My life's on my reason.

537
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,960
Oh, man, I know it's bad.

538
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,960
You gotta be so open good.

539
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,960
Just say it's funny, babe.

540
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,360
Gotta please all make it a dream, babe.

Yeah, I don't want to show me you cause that it's funny.

542
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:18,880
Where have you been all my life?

Are you kidding all of these?

546
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:32,880
I love it.

547
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,880
I love it.

548
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
Fantastic.

549
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,880
Melon, you know, it's satisfying me from the Pod Save Music Network.

550
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,880
Wow.

551
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,880
You know, it's cool.

552
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,880
I found something out the other day.

553
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,880
If you go to podshed.com slash music.

554
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,880
Or if you go to Melony Lewis from from daily source code.com, I'll put the link in

555
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,880
the description.

556
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,880
I'm going to take you to her artist page on the Pod Show Plus.

557
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,380
And you get the artist.

558
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,880
You click on get it to the little master control icon.

559
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,880
You can put that into your collection and then you can play back all of her songs in

560
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,880
a row.

561
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,880
It's almost like an album.

562
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,880
You know, you see, get your album art and then you get all those tracks.

563
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,880
You haven't actually downloaded them.

564
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,880
You can't actually put it onto an iPod or a portable device.

565
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,880
But you can listen to it whenever you want.

566
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,880
And it's cool.

567
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,880
So a little get it there on Melony.

Everybody.

570
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,880
So we're back.

571
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,880
It's feeling good.

572
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,880
I got a lot of work to do here.

573
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
Got a lot of crap to clean up.

574
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,880
Got a lot of boxes to unload.

575
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,880
My part of the house is the last part to be completely moved in.

576
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,880
And I'll start on that today.

577
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,880
Lots of stuff to do with the sky guys coming tomorrow.

578
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,880
I got to take jagging to the shop.

579
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,880
I was at the dentist this morning.

580
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,880
Oh, by the way.

581
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,880
I set my appointment now August the entire month of August.

582
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,880
I'm going in from my airframe overhaul.

583
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,880
And I'm going to have a whole bunch of crap down to my mouth.

584
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,880
And hopefully I'll be able to make it to my death with the teeth that I then have.

585
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,880
Yeah.

586
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,880
It's the midlife airframe overhaul.

587
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,880
All right.
