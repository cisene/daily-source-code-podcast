00:01:32,340 --> 00:02:02,340

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,100
Above that hardcore dance that is got to be a little bit high control of the school

7
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,260
Damn it, but what about the food? The food's the food's the land

8
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,300
Give me a sauce on a mix, and if it ain't food, then don't try to fix it

9
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,940
And think of the summer's on the path, adjust the face and let the album out

10
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,500
Bob, it might be a deal, and let me write my name on it, put your phone on

11
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,980
To the way back, it's just summer time

12
00:02:32,340 --> 00:03:02,340
Give me a sauce on a mix, and let me write my name on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your phone on it, put your

14
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,980
It's a magic, oh my something's all

15
00:04:32,340 --> 00:05:01,100
You know, there's nothing quite like the summer sounds that the brothers John's in

16
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:08,200
Strawberry letter 23 and we'll smith summer time mashed up to kick off the daily source

17
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,100
coach for brand new week everybody how you doing coming to you from the Curry Coast it is

18
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,120
the daily source code episode number 653 it's going to be a rather short show today

19
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,700
for a number of reasons one of which is let me see oh yeah I'm on vacation that's

20
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:30,420
right thanks to Alex from the lowlands for sending that mash up off to me

21
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:38,140
so the weather is atrocious as was not expected but unfortunately yesterday

22
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,620
wasn't a brilliant day today being Monday what are we at the 20th of September

23
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,860
not a sorry August not that great it said the temperature is nice but it's

24
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,340
overcast and just a windy and I kind of sucks for a number of reasons because

25
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,020
you know of course perfect weather to sit inside and do a show and chill out

26
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:06,980
even crank up the fireplace however something with this island is quite disappointing

27
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:12,820
that would be all connectivity blows chunks I have the feeling and I've put

28
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:19,100
in a couple of calls to to the ISP here on the island barrier free and they

29
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,340
kind of confirm that it seems like well first of all everybody is probably inside

30
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,460
everybody's now you can hear an airplane going over everybody's check in

31
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,660
their email and surfing and download and stuff and oh yeah there's lots of

32
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,300
people have peer-to-peer programs running and when you're dealing with a

33
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,780
mesh network and pretty much everyone goes through one or two very thin tubes

34
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,420
to the mainland I guess what there's absolutely no connectivity I mean I can

35
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,500
literally sit here and watch the packets drop off I can I have a ping ping

36
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,020
timer set up and it's just timing out it's horrible and the most frustrating

37
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,540
thing is you know there's lots of stuff that works perfectly well for

38
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,220
instance Yahoo works well but Gmail forget about it completely crap I've tried

39
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,500
well the the Ajax version you can sit and wait for hours it'll never come

40
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
through the HTML version and once in a while part of it'll come through and I try

41
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:21,140
the mobile version let me see I actually just oh here we go yeah it finally

42
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,180
pop through a little bit I'm I can you believe it I'm actually surfing the

43
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:31,020
mobile version of Gmail however whenever I fire up iTunes it goes to download

44
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,660
the podcast I wait a minute now it seems that stuff is starting to pop in

45
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:41,660
for a second let me see I had a show ID for 653 for today it's you know maybe

46
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,860
there's one K per second coming through right now it's it's maddening but

47
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,060
whenever I fire up iTunes now it goes in and accesses media files directly no

48
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,220
problem it brings them in like three three megabits per second sometimes and

49
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,780
then I'll just break off and I is frustrating what kind of tell you so it'll be

50
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,580
a reasonably short show today because I couldn't get to the voicemail

51
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,220
comments I could you know obviously I could barely get through to to Gmail at

52
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,140
all to access any of the stuff that people have been sending in so oh yeah

53
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,700
and did I mention my sister is here now with her two kids age seven or

54
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,100
nine and that's fun for kids when it's a shitty outside in it no so I'm gonna

55
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,140
take them all we're gonna go to the mainland we're gonna take the ferry

56
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:33,980
across and we're going to hit them all which is what you do on a on a cloudy

57
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,220
rainy day and I'm bringing my laptop with me because I'm sure I'll be able

58
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,820
to find a Starbucks somewhere just so I can access my email just whip through

59
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,780
it downloads some stuff so at least I have enough for the next day or two

60
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,620
here's one that was small enough to come through the tubes hey Adam it's Chef

61
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,500
Mark and Jennifer and forget the overhead noise here but we are on American

62
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,100
Airlines back from Guadalajada we heard your podcast from Fira on your first

63
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,220
one and I just have to say immediately stay away from the deer yeah we

64
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,180
stayed away from the ice cubes and the water in Mexico and it wasn't for that but

65
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,660
there were ticks on those deer yeah and they're really lovely and they're

66
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,620
beautiful and you can't feed them from a distance but just don't get up close

67
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,220
and if you do make sure you check yourself for ticks afterwards but other than

68
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,940
that you're gonna have a great time in the minds and by the way I wanted to

69
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,980
thank you for giving your cooking part to me because I'm coming home for Mexico

70
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,740

74
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,500
thing I was looking for on Friday day from New York uh sent this in

75
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,380
hey yeah Adam it's Dave from New York how you doing bro I've been catching up on my

76
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,380
DSC's and I eat your comments in New York for the curry family reunion that's

77
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,340
great happy to have you but before you hop on that plane I think I need to

78
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,220
straighten you out on something you know I mean I have two tingles like the nylon but I

79
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,100
do know what I'm talking about most of the time okay you see you're gonna visit

80
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,420
Guadamala upstate in Almonds New York that's not quite right

81
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,260
Almonds just around the corner from me even west just the county about 30 miles

82
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,660
north from New York City so it's in the New York metropolitan area it's not

83
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:38,220
upstate remember New York is huge it's bigger than England the term upstate is

84
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,980
commonly used to refer to the majority of the state that isn't in the

85
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,220
New York metro area so we usually figure on it's at least a couple hours

86
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,860
drive out of the city before you're upstate anyway we're glad to have you

87
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,260
visit us here in Downstate New York let me know if you need to borrow another

88
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,420
Piaf 40 and a Mike Mixer for your Uncle Dawn interview I'm looking forward to

89
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,540
that to at least I could do for all the Charlie's to give in us all right

90
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:11,580
see ya love ya and uh bed pill no asparagus p and scruncher

91
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,780
Dave fantastic man yeah it was great it was great seeing all of my cousins

92
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,220
particularly now that we're all older you know we have a lot more

93
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,460
I don't know for some reason it seemed like we could relate a lot more to each other

94
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,260
and what I'm gonna do is maybe tomorrow the day after Petrish Niles sit down and

95
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,020
maybe I'll bring Willow in who's as I said she's here with her kids

96
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,300
and we'll talk about the reunion we'll reminisce just a little bit

97
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,300
uh because it really was fun it came believe that we actually wound up square dancing

98
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,580
you should have seen Petrish do a doze I know it was very very funny

99
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,260
so Uncle Dawn yes had some long conversations with him and uh came up with a little

100
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,940
different strategy than then just an interview and the main reason for it was he's also

101
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,380
thinking Uncle Dawn is now almost 80 years old of course he's extremely active he's still

102
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:13,500
the CEO of the Korea Society and as I've told you many times he is directly quite

103
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,020
responsible for calming down the situation in North Korea so just a note on that

104
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,460
when I acquired him on it he said you know North Korea the the political scene is actually

105
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,980
quite stable he says he thinks it's very stable you know more stable than than many regimes

106
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:36,140
but but in general the region is in in trouble you know they they have issues feeding their

107
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:42,380
people they have all kinds of horrible uh torrential rain problems that are

108
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,580
uprooting uh the landscape nothing sticking peep stuff is sliding people are dying so

109
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,540
it says not a fantastic scene but he does say the regime he feels is very very stable

110
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,260
and he's been thinking about writing a book now as you can understand and actually

111
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:09,820
I have it here he served in the CIA from 1951 to 1982 when he retired he received the CIA's

112
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:16,060
highest decoration directly from the director at the time William Casey so there's a lot of

113
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:22,300
things a lot of stories a lot of stuff that that he can talk about and there's a lot of things

114
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,940
that he can't talk about and as you know I said well look you know we'll just talk and then

115
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,420
I'll record everything and anything that you feel is inappropriate you know we'll destroy it we'll

116
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,180
get rid of it and he said you know he really feels like he wants to he because he's a master story

117
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:43,340
teller he wants to tell some stories but then he also feels like he maybe he wants to write a book

118
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,020
and I told him about what we're doing with pod show press and he was very interested

119
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:53,260
in basically creating an audio novel first and then publishing a book of the audio novel

120
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:00,700
which is the model that we've created with pod show press and I think we can get him to do that

121
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,540
but something that I'll do for you I got I wish I had my whole set up here because I really

122
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,660
would like to do a great recording of this he wrote a what he calls a commentary it's not really

123
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,980
review but a commentary on a book which you may have seen if not I recommend you go out and you

124
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,420
buy it because it'll be a great set up for what we're going to do with Uncle Don it's Tim Winer's

125
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:32,300
legacy of ashes and it's essentially it's a it's a book about the early days of the CIA

126
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:39,260
and it's about two and a half maybe three thousand words so it's something that he feels he

127
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,980
probably can't you know because he's he's been published in in all kinds of uh newspapers you know

128
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,020
he's often been quoted in uh washed and posed New York Times he sent in letters to the editor he

129
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,780
said you know this is really too long for a letter to the editor but he wouldn't mind if this

130
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:59,820
got out uh on the internet so I'm going to record the audio version of this and we'll kind of

131
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,980
call that a primer for what's coming let me just give you uh uh here we go let me just give you this

132
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,460
uh I'm going to read the first two paragraphs to you uh because that'll kind of set it up and you'll see

133
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:17,900
how exciting this is going to be so he says for someone who spent 31 years as a CIA operations officer

134
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:25,340
Tim Winer's legacy of ashes is a painful sometimes ugly read my wife that would be on Meg asked me

135
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,140
how it made me feel to read such a litany of failure about an organization that had taken us to

136
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,740
Sipan, Japan, Burma, Vietnam and Korea the most honest answer I can give to that question is

137
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,020
that winers meticulously researched book did not take me by surprise and that I cannot

138
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:47,020
quarrel with his basic conclusions my discomfort and shagrid come from the realization that things

139
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:53,260
were often far worse than I suspected them to be I joined the army 1945 at the age of 17 it was

140
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:59,020
trained as a cryptanalyst this led NSA to approach me in my senior year at Williams College to see

141
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,220
if I would like to resume that career I was interviewed in Washington by an NSA recruiter who quickly saw

142
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,180
that I had no interest in returning to the increasingly technical field of cryptography he advised

143
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:16,140
me to apply to the CIA an organization I had hardly heard of what's the CIA I asked his reply was

144
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,940
oh they a jump out of airplanes and are going to save the world I immediately applied to the CIA

145
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,380
and reported for duties two days for duty two days after my last final examination of college

146
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:33,420
in June of 1951 I'm just going to skip ahead twelve weeks at the infantry school at

147
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,940
Fort Benning came as a vast improvement we felt we were being taught by experts and relish the

148
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,060
experience we were all put under alias and this caused considerable amusement amongst our army

149
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,460
instructors as under the stress of parachute training we frequently forgot what name we were

150
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,500
supposed to be so you know you can only imagine this is just an awesome awesome read and there's

151
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,660
lots of stuff about jumping out of airplanes and doing all kinds of crazy shit that he obviously

152
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:06,300
feels that he can divulge and share with us so I'm going to record this entire commentary on that

153
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:12,460
book and again if you have a chance go out and get the legacy of ashes so you can be prepped for it

154
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:20,060
and with a little bit of perseverance I think we'll be able to get him to open up and start telling

155
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,260
stories that he'll eventually turn into a book and I think it's going to be just fascinating this guy

156
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,700
and give an example I one of the one of the cousins excuse me one of the cousins asked him

157
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:40,300
you know Uncle Don have you ever met George W. Bush because he was the personal security advisor

158
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:47,740
to 41 as we call him in the family that would be a George Bush senior and here's the and really

159
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,300
it's so much better when he tells the story but just to give you an idea of the kinds of stories he has

160
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:59,180
he says well yes I did meet George W. Bush says we were scheduled to play tennis against him and his

161
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:05,260
father so was Bush senior and Bush junior I don't know what year this was and that's Uncle Don said

162
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,180
that he even went to bed really early you know and I wanted to be rested and he said he had never

163
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:15,420
played so poorly in his life before and after the match George W came up to him and said

164
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:24,860
did you really think that you could beat us kind of frightening isn't it and he had that smirk on his

165
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:32,060
face anyway so that's the update on Uncle Don more to come and I'm very excited about it as I said

166
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:38,220
I'll try this week if I can find a nice quiet time and even a quiet spot I'll read this commentary

167
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:44,140
on the legacy of Ash's book so a couple more days here at the beach before we go back to the

168
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:49,580
UK hopefully we'll get some sunshine I'm looking at the windows right now and I can see that the

169
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,060
overcast skies are going to clear up just a little bit but it's not going to be really nice today

170
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,380
so hoping for better weather tomorrow however I do want to brighten up the podcast

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:44,320
hit test number 83. Again, three tracks from way back 77, 1980 and 1987. Three great ones.

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,520
sponsored by Kmartz, back to school, check them out at Kmartz.com or back to school.potshow.com.

193
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,880
So what I'll have to do is take the show with me to the mainland so that I can upload it from the

194
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Starbucks. So I have no idea what time you're going to get this show, but sometime on Monday, if you're

195
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,640
in the United States and maybe Tuesday by the time you get this over in Europe. And I'm going to

196
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,720
wrap it up with one more song. This is something Jersey Todd sent me. Again, I was the only

197
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,200
song I was able to kind of eak down through the tubes off of the pod tape music network. Jersey

198
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,720
Todd just sent me like stop the presses. You've got to check this guy out type of message. I can't even

199
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,480
get to his bio page, but I'm going to play it for you because I got the song. It's Ethan Stone.

200
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,040
Title of this track is Warwick. Well, they left me off the roster.

201
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:34,880
From the time this year, now I feel like such has been known once my spirit here is still

202
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:48,480
I've met with those boosters. Freaks smiles and handshakes full of fear. They've left me in a place

203
00:23:48,560 --> 00:24:01,120
my own trail. I leave them face down in your beer. And when the demons tear you so

204
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,880
make you wish you'd never try.

205
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:24,960
There's a foggy hill top pasture. Where the cows up nobody lies. On my way to Warwick,

206
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:40,720
it's crazy to lift me to the sky. To breathe the air clears my conscience and gives my

207
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:47,840
armies the world to fly.

208
00:24:47,840 --> 00:25:13,840
When they close the road, Warwick

209
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:34,840
From the time you see, Because they said they can't afford it, I felt my soul made disappear

210
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:45,840
I'm going to see her way together, And I just close my eyes and smile

211
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:57,840
Let the freshest wings by me to rest my soul in the wild

212
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:09,840
On my way to Warwick, This grace roofing to the sky

213
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,840
To breathe the air, Clear as my conscience

214
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,840
And gives my wings the world of flight

215
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:32,840
From my way to Warwick, This grace roofing to the sky

216
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:43,840
To breathe the air, Clear as my conscience

217
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:57,840
With the dull drops far, I mean, If my wings the world of flight

218
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,840
From my wings the world of flight

219
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,840
From my soul of flight

220
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,840
From my wings the world of flight

221
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,840
From my soul of flight

222
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,840
I've totally got to agree with you, Jersey Todd, Awesome

223
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,840
It's kind of like a spring scene vibe as well

224
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,840
Like in the Ethan Stone's Warwick, From the pot save music that work

225
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,840

231
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,840
