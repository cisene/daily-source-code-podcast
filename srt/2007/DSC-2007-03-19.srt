You're just a part of it, I won't run and rush

15
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,280
This crazy life will live and it's all apart and growing

16
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,780
You ain't never gonna praise them

17
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,780
No, but you don't have to write what they think

18
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,780
You don't need them

19
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,780
Hey, hey, say, say you can let your head down

20
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,280
You ain't done nothing bad enough to feel so guilty

21
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,780
You're just a part of it, I won't run and rush

22
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,280
This crazy life will live and it's all apart and growing

23
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,780
Crazy life will live and it's all apart and growing

24
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,780
Yeah, Laura Clav, hey, hey sister kicking off

25
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,780
Daily source code five six four coming to you from the curry manner once again

26
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,780
In G town west side, it is the affluent suburb of Surinone's Guilford

27
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,780
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

28
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,780
It's good to be back home, it's I feel I feel

29
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,780
Oh, it's the word I'm looking for, I confused, no, not confused

30
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,780
Disoriented, there you go

31
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,780
I am completely disoriented having flown to different parts of the world in the last last couple of days

32
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,780
Come back, oh besides one other thing that always disoriented me

33
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,780
When the sound isn't right, so I don't know how it happened

34
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,780
I think today's our lovely housekeeper

35
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,780
She was probably up here cleaning in Adams attic and low and behold

36
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,780
She unplugged the mixer and you know what happens when she unplugged the mixer exactly

37
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,780
The sound becomes completely messed up so I'm I'm starting trying to configure it as we speak

38
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,780
Just to make it sound a little bit clearer in your buds because I know you got those buds jammed in deep

39
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,780
All right start of a new week. It's it's Monday. Let me just tell you how things wound up on Friday

40
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,780
I told you it was going to be food barred and boy was it ever

41
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,780
Got to the airport more or less on time time. I had never flown out of a JFK the new terminal

42
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,780
I flown in the new terminal of JFK and but I also never flown virgin out

43
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,780
So I saw the I witnessed the virgin clubhouse quite nice at JFK. I have to say

44
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,780
So we got on the plane you know about half hour late

45
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:50,780
So that was 930 and we stayed on the plane for about two hours and then oh, it's time to you know the runaways now clear

46
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,780
Now we can go take off and we have another another hour of de-icing

47
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,780
Of course, I'm very happy we de-ice but crap. I was like three hours. I did find out something pretty unique though

48
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,780
Because I had elected since it's a very short flight like five hours and 45 minutes and you're flying through the night

49
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,780
So I really wanted to get some sleep to see if I could get onto the right timetable upon arrival in the UK

50
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:21,780
They have a sleeper section which is basically the upper deck you have a whole bunch of was it premium economy

51
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,780
Then the illustrious curtain you always wonder what going on behind the curtain. Well, that's where they have about 10 seats

52
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,780
And what they do is we have to take off to just shut it down, right? It's closed. There's no no food service, no no beverage service

53
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,780
I guess unless you ask for it or go get it. It's just everyone's supposed to be sleeping

54
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,780
And I'm sitting in this chair and in this well chair in the seat and I'm thinking like you know

55
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,780
I think the seat is bigger and so the flight attendant comes over whatever the supervisor

56
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,780
They always you know because I'm on the VIP list

57
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,780
They always come over and they have a little chat and you know, do you need to need any anything

58
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,780
So yeah, can you answer this question for me?

59
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,780
I think this seat is bigger up here than the one I've been sitting in for the past year downstairs

60
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,780
He says no, no, it's all the same service. I don't know, man

61
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,780
It's like I sit in these seats and I notice it immediately

62
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,780
And indeed it turns out that the upper deck the seats are a couple inches longer because of the angle of configuration

63
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,780
They're all kind of at a what are they like a 45 degree

64
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,780
degree

65
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,780
So yeah, like at a 45 degree angle

66
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,780
Okay, I just thought you'd want to know in case you're flying virgin upper class and you want to have a larger seat

67
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,780
It made a difference for me. It really did while sleeping or attempting to sleep it worked

68
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,780
So back Saturday morning later than expected everyone happy to see me. I'm happy to see everybody else

69
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,780
We're having a good time

70
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,780
I'm kind of in and out of consciousness as usual and

71
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,780
Sunday morning around 11 o'clock the lady Patricia had to go because she was attending a fashion show

72
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,780
Oh, it's Couture in Amsterdam

73
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,780
So she's out and I've been playing Mr. Mom got Christina off the school today everything perfectly. You know

74
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,780
I still got to make up the bed and all that stuff that she comes back and immediately you know

75
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,780
She bounces quarters on the bed to see if I made it the bed properly. You know that by now, right?

76
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,780
So anyway

77
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,780
She'll owe us an appearance

78
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,780
For sure she'll owe us an appearance this week

79
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,780

I'll definitely be watching, dude

126
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,780
I was talking to Steve Leads at Sirius

127
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,780
I realized that Steve Leads is the guy who brought me to the United States

128
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,780
And in the mid-80s to work at MTV

129
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,780
And he's been in the radio and record business

130
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,780
I think for most of his adult life

131
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,780
I realized we've been working together for like 20 years now

132
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,780
And so he's over at Sirius

133
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,780
He does talent and industry relations

134
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,780
I'm such a fool

135
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,780
I told you that the Rockwell Hall of Fame was on last week

136
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,780
While while we were in New York

137
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,780
We were in the W Hotel right behind the Waldorf Astoria

138
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,780
Where the dinner, the induction dinner is always held

139
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,780
If I had known that I would have called Leads

140
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,780
And he would have hooked me up with a ticket

141
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,780
They used to cost 1,000 bucks a piece

142
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,780
You could buy table for 10 grand for 10 people

143
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,780
And I'm like, Steve, you know what have been awesome

144
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
And we could have gone

145
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,780
It says, yeah, you know what the prices are now

146
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,780
Well, I don't know, 1500s, how $3,000

147
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,780
How Rockwell is that, huh?

148
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,780
Oh man

149
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,780
Ah, let me see

150
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,780
Roy, I want to remind you about the new show

151
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,780
Angie Bees doing with the main sponsor, Tyler and all

PM

153
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,780
It's called Unwind and it's kind of along the lines

154
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,780
of her chill cast

155
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,780
Only really

156
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,780
This is

157
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,780
It's much more targeted

158
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,780
I think towards putting you to sleep

159
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,780
And I tell you when I listen to Angie

160
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,780
And her dulce of tones

161
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,780
Oh man

162
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,780
That doesn't put me to sleep

163
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,780
It puts me into a

164
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,780
Creative Dreamlike state actually

165
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Of course, Tyler and all PM

166
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Sponsoring the show

167
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,780
And I told Patricia about that

168
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,780
She said, oh, I really want to try those

169
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,780
I don't know if they have them in the UK

170
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,780
It's Tyler and all PM

171
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,780
I know they're marked blue

172
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,780
So you don't take it at the wrong time

173
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,780
During the day

174
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,780
But apparently

175
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,780
This is like some kind of a miracle thing

176
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,780
For women

177
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,780
Who also apparently seem to have more aches and pains

178
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,780
Than men or at least so they claim

179
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,780
And so if they want to go to sleep

180
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,780
The aches and pains disappear

181
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,780
Tyler and all PM seems to be the thing that works best

182
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,780
I don't know if you ever tried it

183
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,780
Let me know

184
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,780
Let's see

185
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,780
Spending the globe

186
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
There you go

187
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,780
Spend a while since we've heard from our friend

188
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,780
From Ecuador, Paul always on the line

189
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,780
Hey Adam, how are you?

190
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,780
It's Pablo from Ecuador again

191
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,780
I hope my last message didn't get to you

192
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,780
But I was going to let you know that

193
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,780
I thought to some friends that they have a band

194
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,780
Their names

195
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,780
Sick

196
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,780
Sick

197
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,780
And now they are

198
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,780
Out members of

199
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,780
But safe music

200
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,780
So

201
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,780
Just

202
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,780
If you want

203
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,780
Just hear a little bit of it

204
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,780
And tell me if you like it

205
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,780
Bye

206
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,780
Alright, Pablo

207
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,780
My man

208
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,780
In Ecuador

209
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,780
Dude

210
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,780
Thank you so much

211
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,780
First of all for spreading the love

212
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,780
Getting the word out

213
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,780
And getting some

214
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,780
Equatorian music on the podcast

215
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,780
Music network

216
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,780
I found them SIQ

217
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,780
Sick

218
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,780
Let me see

219
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,780
From Ecuador

220
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,780

Slip knot system of down

223
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,780
Radiohead corn

224
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,780
Okay, we kind of know we're going to

225
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,780
Or get into

226
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,780
Sick is a part of the rock culture

227
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,780
An Ecuador

228
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,780
I'm just reading directly from the bio here

229
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,780
With a new musical style

230
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,780
This independent band formed by

231
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,780
Agni D

232
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,780
Angotar

233
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,780
Locals

00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,780
Moises on drums

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,780
And 212

236
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,780
On bass

237
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,780
Why didn't they call

238
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,780
Their kids such weird names in Ecuador

239
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,780
Three times they had a number

240
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,780
One hit single in Ecuador in the last year

241
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,780
Alright, chosen

242
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,780
Best rock band of the year

243
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,780
2004

244
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,780
And best alternative

245
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,780
2005

246
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,780
And now on the pod safe music network

247
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,780
Alright, I'm gay

248
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,780
Check out

249
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,780
Watermark

250
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:50,780
Music

251
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,780
By my mind

252
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,780
Still in the future

253
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,780
Still in the future

254
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,780
Still in the future

255
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,780
The spread in the field

256
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,780
In the world we can't take

257
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,780
You're beautiful, alright

258
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,780
Born in Tennessee

259
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,780
Anyway, we're here

260
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,780
But don't miss a thing

261
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,780
And don't miss a thing

262
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,780
And don't miss a thing

263
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,780
And don't miss a thing

264
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,780
And don't miss a thing

265
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,780
And don't miss a thing

266
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,780
And don't miss a thing

267
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,780
And don't miss a thing

268
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,780
And don't miss a thing

269
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,780
And don't miss a thing

270
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,780
And don't miss a thing

271
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,780
And don't miss a thing

272
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,780
And don't miss a thing

273
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,780
And don't miss a thing

274
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,780
And don't miss a thing

275
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,780
And don't miss a thing

276
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,780
And don't miss a thing

277
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,780
And don't miss a thing

278
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,780
And don't miss a thing

279
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,780
And don't miss a thing

280
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:34,780
God, there's no time, some memories will fade

281
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:40,780
My head is unchanged, meaning yes, as we'll remain

282
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:47,780
So keep it alive

283
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:58,780
I love you, boy, I adore this

284
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,780
It makes this way

285
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,780
I love you, baby

286
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,780
I love you, boy, I adore this

287
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,780
It makes this way

288
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,780
I love you, baby

289
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,780
I love you, baby

290
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,780
I love you, baby

291
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,780
I love you, baby

292
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,780
I love you, baby

293
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,780
I love you, boy, I adore this

294
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,780
It makes this way

295
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,780
I love you, boy, I adore this

296
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,780
It makes this way

297
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:09,780
I love you, yeah, I love you, yeah, I love you

298
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,780
I love you, baby

299
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:23,780
I love you, boy, I adore this way

300
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,780
I love you, baby

301
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,780
I love you, boy, I adore this

302
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,780
It makes this way

303
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,780
I love you, boy, I adore this

304
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:48,780
It makes this way

305
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,780
I love you, boy, I adore this

306
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,780
It makes this way

307
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:09,780
I love you, boy, I adore this

308
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,780
It makes this way

309
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,780
I love you, boy, I adore this

310
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:27,060
I was thinking of doing a little cowbell but couldn't quite find the right rhythm to make

311
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,060
it work.

312
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:33,220
Sick, watermark from Ecuador, thanks to Pablo for sending that in.

313
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:38,860
This is what I love so much about what we're doing with podcasting, independent media.

314
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,220
An independent reception device is because if you don't like the song, you just skip

315
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,220
ahead.

316
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,740
It's not a wonderful, it's so much better than the alternative, if you're listening

317
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,420
to the radio, you just can't skip ahead.

318
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,580
In fact, all of my natural broadcasts or instincts are listening to that song going like,

319
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,220
oh man, there's a lot of people who are going to fucking hate this song and I'm going

320
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,220
to lose them.

321
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
I'm not going to lose them.

322
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
They're just going to fast forward.

323
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,220
That's fantastic.

324
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,460
I definitely have to work on the sound of the microphone.

325
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,460
It sounds like shit.

326
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,420
Yesterday, I worked a little bit on my pet project, I've been doing an audio book.

327
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,420
I'm not going to tell you what it is.

328
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,420
Oops, hold on a second.

329
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:22,420
I'm maintaining contact with Lady Patricia through SMS text messaging.

330
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,540
She says that she tried a new hotel last night in Amsterdam and it's one of these like

331
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,420
botic hotels where they take an existing residence and they convert it into, I don't

332
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,020
know, like a 10 or 12 room hotel.

333
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,580
It's overlooking the park and she says it was fantastic and I should definitely try it out

334
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,580
next time I go.

335
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,580
If I ever get to go there again, I mean, cry.

336
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,460
I don't even know where my aircraft is.

337
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:50,220
I think it's an Antwerp being getting its annual checkup, which has to happen every

338
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,220
year.

339
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
I don't know.

340
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,500
I got to go to Holland, man.

341
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
I got business to do.

342
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
I got my bank managers.

343
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
I got to take out to dinner.

344
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,100
I got to get my haircut and Rotterdam.

345
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,580
I got a real business to be taken care of.

346
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,820
Oh, you know, was it Friday or Thursday or Wednesday?

347
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,660
Well, sometimes last week, I got this really angry piece of feedback.

348
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,300
I'll just play it so you can remember again.

349
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,300
No fuck.

350
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,300
Quia.

351
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,300
It's been a while.

352
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:26,180
It was something in this piece of feedback, which was very funny, but I didn't understand.

353
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,780
And now it was a guy if you saw much joy.

354
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,780
Yeah, check it out.

355
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
You won't.

356
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
Yeah, I'm a winker.

357
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,780
I don't get angry anymore.

358
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
I don't know.

359
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,780
I'm freshly out.

360
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
I rehab.

361
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,380
It was in a reference to Trinity, I think.

362
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,380
I do.

363
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,580
But I ain't going to fucking do.

364
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,580
I've been saving a few up.

365
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,580
Any of they are.

366
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,580
Number one.

367
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,220
I don't give a flying fuck what your ass is called, because we all know, and ain't really

368
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,220
your ass.

369
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,700
The brains you'll react to my son is your Mrs.

370
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,540
That's right.

371
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,540
Jet soft to Holland on a Monday morning.

372
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,620
It does a better dance in, better duck in, better dive in, thrit some

373
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,100
beads, and gets a bit of a bun from the rest of the leaves.

374
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,140
And then flies back home on a Friday night to Patricia's home to tear.

375
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
Yes.

376
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Number two.

377
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,740
I don't need another fucking domain name.

378
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
All right, son.

379
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,620
In fact, the only time I want to wear the words go daddy is when me house boy

380
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,620
one is naked, laying across the dining table.

381
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,780
It still throws me up.

382
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,020
I don't take fucking sugar.

383
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,020
All right.

384
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,020
Four.

385
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,020
Trinity.

386
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,780
Three Trinity, not three Trinity, who gives a flying fuck.

387
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,140
You can grab in its tank.

388
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,300
You can shit on its seats for all I care.

389
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,820
You can piss in the washable.

390
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,660
I've only got one suggestion about Trinity's son, Swan Vesta.

391
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,220
So that was the part that I just couldn't figure it out.

392
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,780
What the hell is Swan Vesta?

393
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,460
And luckily, luckily someone is out there ready to help me.

394
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,100
Hi Adam, it's Parkie from this weekend London podcast.

395
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,340
Just ringing in after listening to Friday's show.

396
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,420
Just thought you might like to know.

397
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,460
Swan Vesta is a brand of match over here.

398
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,620
And your cooler was suggesting that you burned Trinity.

399
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,500
So it's a little harsh.

400
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
But there you go.

401
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,660
Anyway, just have a lovely curry in a few points against.

402
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,260
And I'm on my way home.

403
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,940
So thank you very much to today.

404
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,260
Goodbye.

405
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,860
Yeah, as usual, a few points against.

406
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,820
I got to tell you, man, you brits.

407
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,780
I love you dearly, but boy, do you drink?

408
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,540
I guess they Christina had two friends over.

409
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,020
You know, Christina's working now at the boutique.

410
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,460
She works out in that Saturday afternoon from two to six.

411
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,820
I guess she likes figuring out or finding out what it's like to have a boss.

412
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,900
She actually has a quite a good boss, which is nice, good, good first experience.

413
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,980
So two of her friends were over last night.

414
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,700
I don't know, I can move her like seven o'clock in the state for a couple hours.

415
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,260
And both of them, they had their own drink with them.

416
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,980
And they're like drinking beer, which is, I'm cool, you know.

417
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,820
It's like, they're 16 and one of them was 17 and so yeah, that's fine with me.

418
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,140
But they had like five or six bottles of beer each.

419
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,420
And they weren't, you know, didn't even seem to affect them.

420
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,300
And after they left, I said to Christina, I said, dude, you know, what's up with that?

421
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,460
She said, oh, I know dad, it's crazy.

422
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,060
They like to drink so much.

423
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,900
And she was drinking Coke, you know.

424
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,260
Christina doesn't really drink.

425
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,860
She just, she'll have a freezer, one freezer, which will nurse throughout the entire evening

426
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
at a party.

427
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:27,460
And I said, you know, these girls, they seem to be headed nowhere.

428
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,660
And she said, oh, yeah, well, you know, they're both A star students.

429
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,660
I don't understand.

430
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,660
I don't understand.

431
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,940
It's in your DNA somehow.

432
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,740
All right, it's one Vesta being matches.

433
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,300
Now we're not going to burn Trinity.

434
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,460
Trinity's going to be burning it up.

435
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,460
I got to tell you.

436
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:49,300
First of all, let me, is an email that came into the free Trinity group from Timothy.

437
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:55,300
I was a, it's just Timothy Pilgrim, yeah, there you go.

438
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,980
Kind of interesting, dear biodiesel supporter, we hope St. Patrick's day didn't take

439
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,580
all of your energy because today is also national, or today is national biodiesel day.

440
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,260
National biodiesel day takes place on March 18th, the date of Rudolph diesels birthday.

441
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,660
The biodiesel industry chose his birthday to honor him for his foresight and recognizing

442
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,500
the valuable role of vegetable oil based fuel in the late 19th century.

443
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,700
Diesel's ran early versions of his engine on peanut oil and paved the path for today's biodiesel.

444
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
That's interesting.

445
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:30,380
I did not know that yesterday was biodiesel national biodiesel day, national biodiesel day would

446
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,860
be just for the US.

447
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,700
Let's call it international biodiesel day.

448
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,980
Also, of note 62% of US consumers are willing to pay more per gallon for biodiesel

449
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:44,020
than regular fuel, more than four and five consumers continues to support a tax incentive

450
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,700
that would make biodiesel cost approximately the same as regular diesel and while only

451
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,340
3% of consumers surveyed on a diesel vehicle today.

452
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,140
61% say they would consider buying a diesel car because of the benefits of biodiesel.

453
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,340
So again, let's not go to the green side of this.

454
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,460
That's not what this is about, but it's the whole concept of doing something independently.

455
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,060
You've got a car, you've grown up knowing with the knowledge that you have to go to the

456
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,420
man to get your go juice.

457
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,340
Well, no more.

458
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:20,180
Any diesel engine can take biodiesel and I recommend 100% biodiesel and it is very cool.

459
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:25,700
When you go to the biofuelo basis, which is where Trinity gets gasped up in San Francisco,

460
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:32,300
it's just somebody's garage with a couple of big containers of oil, vegetable oil, pre and

461
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:40,380
post-processed and an older fashioned pump, it does have the, you know, the, what

462
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,540
they call it, the spinners with the numbers on it.

463
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,460
So it's not electronic, you know, you hear ding, ding, ding, ding and you see the numbers

464
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,900
actually change in real time flipping over and you'll see in front of this garage, you'll

465
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:57,900
see, you know, easily on a Saturday afternoon, five to ten really nice high and diesel

466
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:03,180
automobiles lined up waiting to get in and it's because people would rather pay, you know,

467
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,220
someone in the garage money than then big oil, I guess.

468
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:12,780
So we're sending Trinity across the USA and we were in New York also pitching some advertisers

469
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,980
to sponsor the trip and as we were pitching it all of a sudden, it started to come out really

470
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:23,100
nice and I think I've found, I think I've found the mission for Trinity and the way it came out

471
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,700
was it's about independence because it's true that it's, and when you're talking to brand

472
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,780
advertisers and you know, stuff like that's, you know, that's what brands like to associate themselves

473
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:38,620
with. So it's about independence. It's a little bit about technology and it's all about relationships

474
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,100
and when it came out like that, it really hit me. I said, this is fantastic. This is exactly

475
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,380
what the promotion should be about. So when you have Doug Pilgrim and his son and they're going

476
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:53,820
to be driving across the USA in Trinity and we have the two girls, one in Boston, one in Maine.

477
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,380
These are the relationships that I hope to have come out in the podcast that they create together

478
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:05,180
as they use Trinity as a catalyst, a catalyst in a vehicle for friendship and independence

479
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,180
from the man. What we have here is a failure to comply.

480
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,460
And now up in the empty sea radio, it's hard to pass it.

481
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,860
The thing that's too big, we need too many way. There's another way and we can breathe back.

482
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,020
Go along, jump in light, follow everybody, find do it like you want to let's all light.

483
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:48,300
Be a bit Cavalier, even try to win a fear better when you fail, when you fail, something's right.

484
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,940
Have the rock on.

485
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,700
This new boy's back to see. Do you know?

486
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,140
Todd just gave me the mug.

487
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,980
I need you up.

488
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,260
Who got jump ball?

489
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,980
Here's up.

490
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,100
There's a nice new back to the radio, don't matter.

491
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,460
Hey Adam and Sean from Dallas.

492
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:19,740
This was a DSC for Fubar and I heard you were talking about

493
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,260
my comment, all that bullshit with the lawsuit.

494
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,980
You know, this is so interesting. I think I said this on Friday as well, but

495
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:35,580
when it comes to copyrights, I'll just remind you, when Potio made a very stupid

496
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:41,100
oversight, stupid mistake. And some people, it was so stupid. Some people think we actually did it intentionally.

497
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:48,060
And we launched our first version of the site and the internal codes to all RSS feeds were linked

498
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,620
to the RSS feed button, which of course was dumb because it should be the original feed, which it is.

499
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:01,580
And we're immediately accused of hijacking stealing and taking profits out of mouths of babies.

500
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:09,580
When it comes to copyrights of the big boys, let's just call them mainstream media. Let's say

501
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,780
Viacom is an example. Then all of a sudden, it's like bullshit and these guys are making

502
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,820
enough money already and it really shows a lack of understanding what goes into creating

503
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:25,420
what you see on television. Make no mistake. This is expensive shit. And part of that, of course,

504
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:31,740
is because of the infrastructure set up, the way things are done, the tools that are used,

505
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:37,020
the amount of people that buy agreement are involved in the process, and also what people are

506
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:43,900
paid by agreement in the process. Also what they're paid for derivatives and copies and

507
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:50,460
syndication rights. And this has been set in stone for many, many years. And one episode of

508
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:56,860
lost. I remember Dave Winner posting on his weblog, you know, how can you know, saying that why don't

509
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:02,060
we all just buy lost through iTunes and they won't have to broadcast that anymore and we'll pay for it.

510
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:10,780
I'm like, dude, it's $5 million per episode is what it costs. $5 million. That's really expensive shit.

511
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:17,420
So anyway, so I do take offense to that, you know, stealing of copyright, copyrighted material is stealing

512
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:23,420
a matter of who you steal it from. I'm also against fake Gucci bags and fake sunglasses,

513
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:30,060
and I hate that. I really, you know, I know lots of women who buy these things. And my wife is

514
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,900
bought sunglasses on the streets of New York. And I said, you know, go ahead, you know,

515
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,300
and one day someone's going to rip your shit off and you're going to be really pissed because,

516
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:43,100
you know, that's how it works. And if it were the other way around, you'd be pissed right now.

517
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:50,540
Oh, yeah. I'm so against it. Anyway, let's listen to the rest of the, the question slash comment.

518
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:59,260
As YouTube and a little note story, I mean, I guess it was kind of big, but a couple days before that

519
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:06,700
parks, you can see the peanut Google for the names of some users that uploaded some stuff

520
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:15,580
from his production house. Let me just say one thing, Mark Cuban owns the Dallas Mavericks

521
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:21,020
basketball team, which he bought partially with the proceeds from his sale of broadcast.com to Yahoo

522
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:29,580
at the height of the dot com bubble made out like a bandit. I think was like three or four billion

523
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:36,620
dollars. That's so much money. And he's doing a lot of things. He'll be bought as basketball team.

524
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:45,020
He has an HD high definition movie production company and doesn't he also own the HD channel.

525
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,660
I think he does. So he's he's working a whole different angle of the changes in media.

526
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:57,500
Basically, I just wanted to comment on what a fucking hypocrite Mark Cuban is because if he's

527
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,780
the peanut in these things and he's going to sue Google over it, I'm pretty sure that he made his

528
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:08,140
money by stealing other people's content and rebroadcasting it over the internet.

529
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:16,060
I think if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure Mark Cuban is a huge fucking hypocrite. So just wanted

530
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:25,340
to get to take on that, still a mask, then go mask. And I am definitely 100% scruncher piece.

531
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,340
Well, I can tell you a scruncher, my friend, because you have some hidden anger there,

532
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:36,460
trifolding it might sue you your soul. I think the, you know, broadcast.com didn't have much

533
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:41,340
really going forward in assets. I think the only thing it really had was the agreements. I think

534
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:46,620
they did have the licenses from mainstream media. I don't think it was a very profitable

535
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,060
project because of the expense of the licenses, but I think that's really what he did have.

536
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:57,980
So I could be wrong on that. I'm not sure, but let's just say I'm quite confident that I think

537
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,860
that was the only thing that broadcast.com really had short-up was all the online rights and licenses.

538
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,260
And at the time, there were probably much, much easier to get under certain regulations.

539
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:14,860
So I don't think he's a hypocrite. I think human is just trying to figure out where the world is

540
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:22,460
going. I thought I read his blog, blogmaveric.com. I always read it with interest to see what

541
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:30,220
angle, what his take is on the latest developments. And when it comes to, you know, when it comes

542
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:35,980
to copyright infringement or theft, you know, I understand why he's all over this. So yeah,

543
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:43,100
I think what he's trying to do is trying to prove the Google cannot hide behind the

544
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:50,140
safe harbor of the DMCA, the digital millennium copyright act. And he's stirring the shit up.

545
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:54,460
That's for sure. And I saw a recent post, which I thought was pretty interesting. Where

546
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:01,660
he claims that you can't hide behind safe harbor if you know that there is infringement going on.

547
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:07,020
And he had a very interesting post. He said, why don't we subpoena the Google searches of

548
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:13,500
Eric Schmidt. Eric Schmidt is the CEO of Google. And let's see if he did any searches for like,

549
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,340
you know, the daily show or any of any other properties. Because if he did, then in theory,

550
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,380
he would have known. And therefore, would not be able to hide behind the safe harbor of the

551
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:30,140
digital millennium copyright act. I mean, this is really interesting times we live in. And

552
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:36,140
particularly interesting for us in independent media because, you know, what value does Google have

553
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:43,100
if, if you can't advertise on it, because of infringement or if there's so much infringement,

554
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:48,060
it just becomes useless as a business tool. That's going to be very interesting to watch.

555
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,380
And I think his other premise is that he believes that, and there are more voices going up

556
00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:00,380
about this that Google is basically building their business on stealing copyright from others.

557
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:06,220
Now, the book industry certainly believes that I think the record industry has has given up on that.

558
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:11,500
The movie industry, well, we're about to see certainly the television industry is of that opinion.

559
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:17,180
And there was big article in the Financial Times today about Google and about it being down

560
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:24,540
12% since the beginning of the year. And I don't know, it's price to earnings ratio is now

561
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:30,780
all out of whack and who knows. I guess the investors are finding it that it's taking too long

562
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:37,900
for Google to get to what they call Google 2.0, which would be, I guess brand advertising or, you know,

563
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,300
the next wave of money that is out there when it comes to advertising. And we've talked about this.

564
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:47,260
It's going to be much harder to get brand advertisers on board when you can't really predict

565
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,940
what the future content is going to be on each placement.

566
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,940
Alrighty, let me see. One more promo that I had in the wings here.

567
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,820
This is Samable, Samage from autobluggreen.com. The past year, autoblug green has been bringing

and launched the autobluggreen podcast. On the first show, Sebastian, I review the green car

571
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:21,340
introductions from the recent Geneva Motor Show. And I have an in-depth interview with Martin Everhard,

572
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:26,540
the CEO of Tesla Motors, builder of the amazing Tesla Roadster electric sports car.

00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,060
Guys, it's autobluggreen.com.

576
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,860
I got to tell you that Tesla, that's an amazing machine. I went to the launch of that in Los Angeles

577
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:49,500
in an airport in a hanger, a aircraft hanger. It goes zero to 60 in like four seconds. It's unbelievable.

578
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,540
It just pressed as accelerator down. It's like a golf cart, a golf cart, bad out of hell.

579
00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:02,300
Experience is awesome. And I see postings around the internet saying that I'm against

580
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:11,340
what is it that, I don't know, just basically saying that I'm evil as usual, promoting this,

581
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,700
people actually writing that I'm promoting this alternative view on global warming from the channel

582
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,220
form movie. Hey, all I'm doing is pointing it out. Okay, I just go take a look at it,

583
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:26,140
make your own decision. I'm no scientist. I'm no ecologist. I do my bit to be green. I've always

584
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:31,980
done that. In kindergarten, we were collecting can. First grade. I'm sorry. We were collecting

585
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,220
cans to recycle. You know, it's culture. Of course, we're going to try and protect the planet.

586
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:43,660
But God, just because I point one thing out, people are all over my shit saying that I don't care

587
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:50,700
about the environment. It's unbelievable. This place we've gotten ourselves into.

588
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,780
Let's just evaluate everything based upon the evidence. I have seen a lot more news articles

589
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:02,620
about the movie, the great global warming swindle. And of course, you can find a link to that

590
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:08,460
in, uh, was it, uh, show notes from a week ago, channel 4 program. All right, got a wrap it up

591
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,060
short today with some music that, uh, well, once again, it's self-submitted.

592
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,500
Hey, Adam. It's Ray Anthony from RadioGuide.com. First, I want to thank you for playing the clip

593
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,740
of my interview with Potsafe Music Network artist Pete Hopkins, back in February.

594
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:33,180
Secondly, I would love for you to hear Amy Kooney. We recently spoke and I discovered that not only

595
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,620
is she an amazing talent, but she's had a fascinating life. She candidly told me about her

596
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,580
kidnapping in Central America, a few years back. Her appearances on TV's Gilmore girls,

597
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:48,220
among other things, and we sampled songs from her EP. Here's Amy Kooney talking a little bit

598
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:52,940
about her life as a missionary kid. And what I was 14, my dad, kind of out of the blue,

599
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:59,580
just decided to move her family to Honduras and do missionary work. He just up and sold the house

600
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:04,940
and, uh, yeah, you know, it's interesting. He just didn't feel like we were doing what we were

601
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:10,780
supposed to be doing. And he says, now, you know, every day, he got up and did the motions and

602
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,500
did there routine stuff, but he just didn't really feel like any of us were where we needed to be.

603
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:20,780
Now, she's not yet on the PMN, but I've got her permission to play this for you. This is Amy Kooney,

604
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,740
so help me God.

605
00:40:45,500 --> 00:41:01,580
We were sitting side by side in the theatre, but the whole time we had eyes on each other,

606
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:20,940
I'm by with touching and squirming in our chairs. You whisper something funny and sweet

607
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:29,260
love things in my ear. So help me God, you don't you do that again. You might wake up,

608
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:38,620
enough we're taking a man, so help me God, don't you do that again. You just might be my

609
00:41:38,620 --> 00:42:08,620
man, so help me God, don't you do that again. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

610
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:35,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Kara,

611
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,280
Go and do that again

612
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,280
In just my dream

613
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,280
But next, we'll keep it coming

614
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah

615
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,280
So let's go, let's go

616
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,280
