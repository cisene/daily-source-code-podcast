1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey Peter, can I ask you a question?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yes, do you?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Who would you say our calls important?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
After 20 minutes of being our hold, I'd have to say now.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Please continue to hold.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Your call is important to us.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, it's very correct.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's very important.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then we'll hold music.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Uniflight communications.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Our bus is going.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hey Adam, this is Papay from Mexico.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I wanted to tell you something to kick off the DSC 531.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Back a few months ago, my cousin, he said,

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You come over to the islands and you can work on the farm and grow lots of ganja.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So me and my cousins, we got on a boat and we went to the islands to grow the ganja.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And then he said, don't worry about going to bathroom.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You just take a dump right there in the middle of the field.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The farmer likes it for fertilizer.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So all day, we did it.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We took a dump in the middle of the field after eating our refrad beans.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, Adam, I saw him collecting all the plants when we were done.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And he said somewhere especially for you.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So next time, you'll light up a big fat joint.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Just think you're sucking on my butt.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, that's right.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I want to take you on a little sound scene tour.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I have something to show you.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want to take you on a little sound scene tour.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I have something to show you.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Bile diesel.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Bile diesel.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, I am so excited.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Will you sell me this car?

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Can you figure it out yet?

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I actually reached my pocket.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Pull it out and start talking.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Can you figure it out yet?

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And ladies and gentlemen, I present you with

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Trinity, Trinity, Trinity.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It is about doubt.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The ugliest, the ugliest car I've ever seen in my entire life.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's about all the luxury you're going to get.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Bile diesel.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Bile diesel.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Bile diesel.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Bile diesel.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, I am so excited.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I just like that.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A young, cute engine.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What is this set to?

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's me kicking the rear bumper.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, excuse me, I can't say it.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hold on, hold these different things.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Got my coat on.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Coming down at you.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay, I want to say.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Right.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, I want to say.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Right.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And it is already completely outfitted with a Bile diesel engine.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
99.9% vegetable oil.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Platform.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Listen to that puppy perk.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And in the runs of the shop, Bile diesel.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Bile diesel.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Bile diesel.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, I am so excited.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This car was mentioned for me.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And it runs like a child.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Sipes of DJ.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Wack and daily source code.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Charlie episode 531 into high gear.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Reminding us that it's time to save the world and win valuable prizes.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Your chance to drive away with Trinity in the show.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I've had a vision.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
A little fantasy.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And it was all about you.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And it isn't like it can't become reality.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If what I've heard is true.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, I'm on a mission.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And there's no stopping me.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
From taking what is right there, mine.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Working with precision.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Getting where I want to be.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Can only be a matter of time.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Because I grew tired of playing by the rules.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Waiting for my fortune to turn.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I know now what I need to do.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You know it's not too late to learn.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He's my revelation.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I got an idea.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Won't the real deal.

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't want to set no car in a tension.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's just not too hard.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh, my revelation.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Nothing to fear.

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But I don't have enough.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But I'm going with anticipation.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And it's all for you.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'd rather live a dream than just dream of it.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But I's both open wide.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Because I'm loving it.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And I know that you're feeling it.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And something that you just can't hide.

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The water looks deep when you're standing on the edge.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Instead of even dipping your toe.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll never let you get out of your death.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Join me in my rebel and blow.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Here's my revelation.

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I got an idea.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Won't the real deal.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't want to set no car in a tension.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's just not too hard.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But I'm going with anticipation.

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Nothing to fear.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But I don't have enough.

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But I'm going with anticipation.

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And it's all for you.

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'd rather live a dream than just dream of it.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And it's all for you.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And I'm not afraid of the light.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And what I genuinely want to think is my right.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Because I'm scared I don't want to see.

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So let's enjoy the fruits of what I so own.

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And it's getting stronger.

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We don't have to worry about it.

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I don't know.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't tell me that you've been alone.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't know my revelation.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I got an idea.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That the real deal.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't want to set no car in a tension.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's just not too hard.

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But I don't have enough.

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I'm only feeling sorry.

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But I don't know my revelation.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's just not too hard.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But I'm going with anticipation.

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And it's all for you.

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And I'm not afraid of the light.

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And they can lead me out.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,760
And I feel I need a

148
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,740
Oh what, how, you know, you're moreï¿½ feel

149
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,440
So, I hearOOoh, oh what, you know,

150
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,180
another exception and

151
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,500
oh, and you're better, you're hotter

152
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,760
Why, even?

153
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,880
Ugh!

154
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,380
I'm the person here in the drain

155
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,420
the bus in your car, walking to work.

156
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,540
That's just no way you can stand still with this.

157
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,620
Melanie Lewis revelation.

158
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,620
That's what you get, man.

159
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,700
When you do the show, late at night from the condo.

160
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,500
And I've got that 180 degree look over the bay

161
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,980
and over the financial district.

162
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,780
And you just get into a whole different mood

163
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,420
of, I don't know, for some reason,

164
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,420
I mean, to the ladies tonight.

165
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,140
Hey, a lot of Mr. Steve from North Abaston.

166
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,140
Thinking, if you do any opinions on having your daily source

167
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,980
code done at night, and then what I get ready in the morning,

168
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,980
it's all set for me to go for my commute in the morning.

169
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,180
I love that idea.

170
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,140
So please, keep it up.

171
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,220
I already, it's January 23rd, and I am already listening

172
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,060
to the daily source code number 530.

173
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,460
Normally, I wouldn't get that until I get home from work,

174
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,820
and then I wouldn't even listen to it until the next day

175
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,660
in my car.

176
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,300
So yeah, definitely keep up doing daily source code

177
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,380
the night before.

178
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,380
And thanks a lot.

179
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,460
I love the show by.

180
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,100
You know, I thought about that a lot, and it's so difficult

181
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,740
because, ah, what is it?

182
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,180
20 years of radio training has got me into this vibe

183
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,380
of being able to, or, you know, really creating a vibe

184
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,500
around the time that everyone's listening,

185
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,380
all at once, all the same time.

186
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,060
And I'm always so afraid that I'm gonna be in such a different mood

187
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,460
when I record the daily source code versus the mood

188
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,300
that you're probably in when you're listening to it.

189
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,140
Now, I guess I'm just kind of presuming

190
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,020
that a lot of people listen to the show

191
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,540
during their commute on their way to work or coming home

192
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,540
from work.

193
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,140
And when I'm doing like a show this like,

194
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,900
you know, what time is it now in San Francisco?

195
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,100
It's 11 p.m. which for me is late because I think it was

196
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,060
three, a lot this afternoon when the jet lag finally hit,

197
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,900
you know, kaboom like a brick wall.

198
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,380
I almost went down and had a very busy day.

199
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,060
I started off early this morning doing our first,

200
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,460
so we call it a pilot.

201
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,460
And since it's an actual reality-based show,

202
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,740
the pilot will never actually air.

203
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,580
The video podcast that Natalie Delcante is doing with us in Pod Show.

204
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,380
And, you know, it was just a lot going on.

205
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,260
And then at three o'clock,

206
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,580
we had to go to Santa Clara to go see, you know,

207
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,420
was Intel.

208
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,180
Man, Santa Clara's a long way away from San Francisco.

209
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,340
And this traffic and, and, you know,

210
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,740
and the jet lag just like, ah, and the car seat was nice and warm.

211
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,100
I'm just drifting off, I'm thinking to myself, yeah,

212
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,940
now it's getting to me.

213
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,900
I don't think I slept more than five and a half hours last night

214
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,300
because I was up really early this morning,

215
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,740
just in case the cable guy came back and luckily the cable

216
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,580
is still working, knock on wood again.

217
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,420
There we go.

218
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,700
You know, I got this nice wooden candlestick on the

219
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
the baker's rack here.

220
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,900
I got a candle going.

221
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,180
I'm telling you, I got a complete vibe.

222
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,660
Let me see, what's, what shall we do first?

223
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,700
First, I just want to make mention that, you know,

224
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,700
I was on the episode number 25 of this week in tech.

225
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,700
Oh, man.

226
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,780
If you look at, was it tweet dot com slash 85.

227
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,860
Leo's got an amazing audience.

228
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,580
They're so incredibly loyal.

229
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,180
And they really don't like me.

230
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,660
Okay.

231
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,500
You should take a look at some of the comments over there.

232
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,060
Comments coming in to the phone line as well.

233
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,180
I really appreciate you guys

234
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,940
gaining to the call of the more voicemail messages.

235
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,020
Hi, Adam, it's Kate from the UK.

236
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,460
I think last time I gave Guy Falk's poem or something.

237
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,740
But it was just for you because you were

238
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,860
lamenting the fact that no one's wrong with you.

239
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,020
So I'm really, I think I have to say wish I was over in a month

240
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,820
or I'm not fucking freezing in the UK.

241
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,100
Really cold.

242
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,380
Anyway, I'm a children, Jay Goodie saying,

243
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,900
well, I have one thought on it.

244
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,340
Now, would that be such an outcry?

245
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,780
Sure, for being taken to make out to Jay Goodie's accent.

246
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,620
I'm not the sending Jay to the toilet thing.

247
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,780
Oh, I was disgusting.

248
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,620
But just to talk, okay, keep safe.

249
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,620
Bye.

250
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,500
Yeah, this is about a celebrity big brother

251
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,340
when I was talking about yesterday.

252
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,500
Jade Goodie, the celebrity because she won the regular

253
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,860
big brother competition.

254
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,660
I believe totally being made a scapegoat of a larger issue.

255
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,220
And you know, I've gotten a lot of email about it.

256
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,820
I'd have to say 99% positive, not necessarily

257
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,060
ring with me, but positive that this is something

258
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,140
that doesn't need to be discussed.

259
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,940
I think that it is quite clear that this is something

260
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,180
that goes on, not just in Britain, but all over the world.

261
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,900
And honestly, you know, there's racism

262
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,580
and then there's, you know, just mocking someone

263
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,820
and there's name calling and, you know,

264
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,100
but that stuff doesn't really matter.

265
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,700
If you look up the true definition of racism,

266
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,900
it really is considering someone is of lesser value

267
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,940
based upon primarily skin color.

268
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,860
Now, I don't think any of that has to,

269
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,980
if this is just people who don't know,

270
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,900
you know, the things you don't know,

271
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,420
you can, you're afraid of maybe you make fun of.

272
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,620
That's probably more like it.

273
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,540
But we all do it.

274
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,380
We all make fun of each other's accents.

275
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,660
And you know, would, would there have been outrage

276
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,260
if this Jade Goodie had,

277
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,500
I'm sorry, if she'll push Eddie, the body would starve.

278
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,140
She had started to mock Jade Goodie's kind of what we call it,

279
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,220
common accent.

280
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,340
Well, no, probably not.

281
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,700
But you know, that's just the misdirection of society.

282
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,420
Now, that's a fucking TV show.

283
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,260
Okay.

284
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,820
And if you identify with that TV show,

285
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,700
then, you know, look to yourself, really.

286
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,340
But again, I think we all do it.

287
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,300
Let me do it some pretty interesting emails that came in

288
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,140
about that.

289
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,540
Let me just see how I can find one of those.

290
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,540
I want to share with you.

291
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,500
When I was at, I thought I had saved it in my Google

292
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,940
note pad.

293
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,700
And I made a mistake, it's not in there.

294
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,540
Okay, crap.

295
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,980
Yeah, we'll probably wrap up the week with some more

296
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,820
about that.

297
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,620
It's way too late for me to get into heavy duty discussion.

298
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,620
But, all are at it.

299
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,700
Oh, yes, he's here.

300
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,700
Come extra.

301
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,700
Come extra.

302
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Come extra.

303
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,700
Come extra.

304
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,700
Come extra.

305
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,700
Come extra.

306
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,700
Come extra.

307
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Come extra.

308
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,700
Come extra.

309
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Come extra.

310
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
Come extra.

311
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
Come extra.

312
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
Come extra.

313
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Hi, Adam Kerry.

314
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,700
Here is your European Union correspondent.

315
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Me.

316
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
More.

317
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Come extra.

318
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,700
We blogger from www.comeextribblock.com.

319
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Yes.

320
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,700
This Georgie talking in background.

321
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:41,940
I just wanted to say that you are an asshole because you didn't mention that German

322
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:52,060
Jackson on British big brother also was racist and was using terms like white

323
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,420
trash, for example.

324
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:01,660
So how the fuck it is okay for people of color to be racist, but white people

325
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:08,660
can't even scratch their asses without being accused of racism.

326
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:15,540
You're just, you're, well, you're, yeah, absolutely.

327
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:22,140
That's, I think it's what we started in the early 90s political correctness, you know,

328
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,140
what you can and can't say.

329
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,140
I don't care.

330
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,020
You can call me whatever you want.

331
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,180
Please spell my name right.

332
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,180
That matters to me.

333
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:34,180
Kind of interesting how comic strip blogger sounds a bit like the, the kid, the baby in,

334
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,180
meet the fuckers.

335
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,180
Ash.

336
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,180
Whoo.

337
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:46,180
Ah, see, yes, but he wants to interview me, beginning of February when I get back.

338
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,700
I really want to do it, but timing wise, I get back.

339
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,740
What is it on the 29th and he's in town on, you know, the third or something.

340
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,740
I don't know.

341
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,140
It's timing wise really hard to meet up and I really don't know if I

342
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,380
actually want to see what he looks like or actually want to meet him because I have such

343
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,060
an image of what he's like that, I don't know, it, it might ruin it for me.

344
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,060
I'm not quite sure.

345
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,780
So I'd much rather do via Skype, I do want to do it CSP, you know, I mean to that, man.

346
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,620
Hey, yeah, so we're going to talk about Trinity in a couple of minutes and, uh,

347
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,700
Mark Yoshimoto Namcoff with another own shaking promo.

348
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:30,180
The best assassins in the world are ruthless and clever killers who get paid a lot of money

349
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:37,380
to make problems go away and one of them is going to be a hundred million dollars richer

350
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:44,820
if they can eliminate all the competition before the competition eliminates them.

351
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:52,020
From the mind of Mark Yoshimoto Namcoff, the creator of Shadow Falls comes number one with

352
00:16:52,020 --> 00:17:00,100
the bullet, the free serialized audio book guaranteed to put your adrenaline in the crosshairs,

353
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:07,220
get on target at number one bullet.podshow.com.

354
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,940
Alright, Mark, I'm jealous.

355
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,940
I wish Don would do something for me, man.

356
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,940
That is so cool.

357
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,060
Actually, now I don't want it anymore because now everyone has the inner world, you know,

358
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:23,140
we start talking about that, huh?

359
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:29,540
So I realized after I listened to a little bit of yesterday's show and that I was talking

360
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,460
about Trinity and that there, well, I know that there are more listeners than the last time

361
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,520
we were actively talking about Trinity.

362
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,900
Trinity is a, a 1984 Mercedes station wagon, 300 turbo diesel, five cylinder running on

363
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:52,260
biodiesel that I mentioned, it's eggnog color and cream, eggnog cream in color and it started off

364
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,420
as an experiment, a great science experiment, she's been looked after lovingly, new transmission,

365
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:06,820
new tranny, new tranny under that hole, you know, it's a car for 1984, so it rattles a little bit

366
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,460
here and there, but in general, everything is, is damps, hippie, replace the fuel filter last trip

367
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:20,180
out to San Francisco and she gave out on me once again, fuel starvation, but really the problem is

368
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,020
when you're, oh, any car of that age, it's quite amazing that she actually starts every single time

369
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:32,900
and only drive it, you know, maybe to the office when it's raining. So very, you know, it just

370
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,380
does not get a lot of road time and it's not good for a car like that, particularly when you're dealing

371
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,100
with biodiesel, which is made by the fine folks at bio fuel oasis in Berkeley, California,

372
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,860
but basically it's someone's garage, you know, you back up into it and you fill her up and they got

373
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,180
big tanks there and so there's sediment and all kinds of stuff and impurities that I'm sure

374
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:58,580
eventually just start to clog stuff up. So, you know, it's almost like, it's what it feels like

375
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,700
to me, like the family has a new baby in the family, but we have to get rid of the dog

376
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:12,100
because, you know, the baby's allergic to pet hair. That's kind of how it feels to me. So I want

377
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,060
I really want Trinity to have a new home, a good home, people will who will take care of her,

378
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,660
love her, respect her. I'm report back on her from time to time, but I also just want to give it

379
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,060
away and make a, you know, some cool last promotion that we can run here on the source code.

380
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,660
So I have a couple thoughts about that. I've also put it with the Mark and Steve, the right

381
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:40,180
virality brothers. I've been talking about it at the office and actually you have a pretty

382
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:47,940
interesting offer, which I'll play for you right after this. Hello, this is Scott and this is Cheryl

383
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:54,900
Tagalong is from podcast our way through Europe at a year in Europe dot com. That's www dot a year in

384
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,580
Europe dot com. Hey, what time did our train leave? Um, okay.

385
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,420
All right, sounds like fun, right? You listen along to a couple who were, um, bumming the way through

386
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:14,660
Europe and doing podcast from the road. So, imagine my delight when I heard this message come in.

387
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:21,300
Hey, Adam, this is Doug Pilgrim. And I'm putting in a request for you to give me

388
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:29,540
Trinity. And here's the idea behind the project. I want to fly myself and my son out to San

389
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:36,740
Francisco to picture an A up and during the course of seven days, we'll drive a Trinity across

390
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:42,340
country, back to Boston, Massachusetts from San Francisco. Now, the cool thing about this will be,

391
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:50,580
we will be podcasting every day, life on the road with Trinity and trying to get her from

392
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:57,700
coast to coast by just using bio diesel fuel all the way across. And the cool thing about this is

393
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,700
not why would we be able to do something like that? Well, first of all, I have my own podcast called

394
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:09,460
Sustainable Business Practices. And, and I interview people along when I'm on the road

395
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:15,300
about different sustainable efforts that their businesses are doing. And my son, who's 19,

396
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:21,940
is an engineer at the Massachusetts Paratomic Academy in search of the word diesel mechanic here.

397
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:29,460
So, which I'll have is a greenie and a mechanic going from coast to coast. And it can be a

398
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:35,300
really cool thing. You know, during the course of driving across, we'll interview people from

399
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:45,060
grease car enthusiasts to electric motorcycle drag racers to a hemp car drivers and each day

400
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:53,380
to get that up. Did I hear that right? hemp car drivers? motorcycle drag racers to a hemp car drivers

401
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:02,580
interesting idea. And each day and that will get that up and posted. Well, use the pod show

402
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:10,420
network for posting it. And the program be called free Trinity. And I'm sure you can appreciate

403
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:18,580
double untongered there. We'll be having a free car. And also, we'll be freeing it from your garage

404
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,460
and giving her a cruise across the country. Now, this could either turn to a real good,

405
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:30,500
feel good travel story with a fire and sun cruising across the whole country together. Or it could be

406
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:37,140
one of those horrible traumas where Trinity breaks down and some kind of a frozen pass. And

407
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,900
the sun is forced to convert to cannibalism to make it through the week. So, if you go either way,

408
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,580
but it could be a real interesting adventure. And we'd like to pull that off. So, if you're interested,

409
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:58,020
give us the free Trinity and we'll give you a podcast seven days worth of a podcast that you're not

410
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:04,500
soon to forget. So, listen, once you go to freetrainay.com, I have a going to my splash pod,

411
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,500
I have a going to my splash page for my regular show. That's a sustainable business practices.

412
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,580
And you get a feel for some of the interviews that I've done in the past. And so,

413
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,540
tell me what you think. Tell me if this is something you want to go with, where we'd really look

414
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,140
forward to something like this. And plus, the kid could use a car going back and forth from

415
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:29,140
here to the academy. That's it. I hope you get this before you a podcast tomorrow morning.

416
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:35,140
Thanks, I'm back. So, I really, really like this idea. For a number of reasons, the first one being

417
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,700
here's a father and son project. I'm a sucker for shit like that because I think the only father

418
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:47,700
and son project I ever had with my dad was the Y Indian guides. We went there twice and made some

419
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:54,340
fucking like tile with mosaic mirrors on it now. So, that always gets me. I love that.

420
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,420
You know, it's a, it's a, it's a manly thing. It's a bonding thing to drive across the United

421
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:03,540
States of America in any vehicle or any mode with your son. That's, I think that's a pretty good,

422
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:10,020
that's a big deal. So, that kind of got me. And then I'm thinking, man, this is a, this is a great show.

423
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,300
What can we do to turn this into an awesome show?

424
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:20,900
Um, and I think, you know, it could be maybe two or three weeks worth of programming

425
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,060
because, you know, you don't want to listen to our long updates. And I'm sure that every single

426
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:32,020
24 hour period that's going to be a lot going on. And I'm thinking video, that's what I'm thinking.

427
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:39,140
And yes, the idea of, of only using biodiesel, but how about stopping off at

428
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:48,420
houses of other listeners, um, yeah, other listeners who listen to the show. Yeah.

429
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,500
And even better, maybe if you're a podcast or because then you can do your own report.

430
00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:00,100
But if you're listening to this on serious stars one or two, sorry. You don't get the whole story.

431
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,820
So, maybe we could map this out. If someone starts a, a friper map

432
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,260
and we can start to plan a route. And I think that each, you get to help me with this. So come up with

433
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:16,180
some ideas, but perhaps each stop along the way, the person has to have a few biofuel. So that means

434
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:20,500
everyone has to go, because this is how we're going to get, um, mainstream media interested.

435
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,860
And this is a story, I think, that actually could, you know, it could catch on. And we got to get

436
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:32,500
some kind of cool custom paint job on the side of Trinity. And it's a really long slogan,

437
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:39,860
but because it's a station wagon, it'll fit. Save the world win valuable prizes and then free

438
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:46,260
Trinity. I'm liking this idea. And by the way, of course, we'd pay for the trip out here and we'd

439
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:52,900
pay for expenses, you know, part of, you know, we'll pay for all that. Come on, you're, you're a winner.

440
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,700
So unless I hear a better idea, I'm, I'm really liking that. I'm liking the idea we can get

441
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:03,860
program programming out of it. It will be great, you know, it could, it could say something. It could be

442
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,180
certainly, uh, if not Trinity's last to raw, one of her, one of her great ones, you know, here,

443
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:15,860
here we are, it's possible to drive across the United States of America on vegetable oil.

444
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,540
Now, I think that will be a very interesting story. And I think we could pick something up along the way.

445
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:27,300
And I'm totally into it. So let me know what you think, Adam at podshow.com, or of course,

446
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,300
you know what, and I'll turn down the volume I've learned. Here we go.

447
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,300
I almost want to rip my nuts out every single time I hear that, I gotta get a new one of those.

448
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,180
Hey, where's Jeff Smith, by the way? Jeff, man, where are you? He must be busy. He must be working

449
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,300
his ass off for something, because I haven't heard from him in weeks. And he still owes Patricia

450
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:06,020
a remix. By the way, buddy, don't worry about it. Whenever you're ready, I just want to make sure

451
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,140
you're okay. I haven't heard from you. Haven't seen anything and just don't know what's going on.

452
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,580
Okay, one last song for you. I'm so happy. She finally puts a music up on the podshow

453
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:22,820
music network. Rachel Fuller from Indiana. Fantastic show that she does with her boyfriend,

454
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,540
Pete Townsend from this little band. You might have heard of called the Who.

455
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:32,260
Check out the intro of the new in the attic, which is up now in the attic.podshow.com, or in the

456
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:37,700
attic.btpodshow.com, but Rachel, you know, she's not, you know, she's just not a yoga.

457
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,940
Now, that's your immediate instinct, you know, because she's in the music, and she's saying,

458
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:49,220
and she has her own album, and she's younger, and she's pretty, and you know, you watch her on the

459
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,300
show, and you, and you kind of get to know her, and she's just awesome, man. I think I'm,

460
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:58,900
I'm really in love with Rachel, and her voice is, it gets me. There's something about it.

461
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:04,500
It's not perfect, you know, but it's so sweet. Somehow, I just can't get enough of listening to her.

462
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:11,620
And one of the songs you put up on the, on the P.M.N is titled Just Breathe, and it's Pete playing

463
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,020
guitar. In fact, he even kicks the song off. One, two, three.

464
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:32,740
I think you say, nothing's okay. It's harder each day just to chase your face away.

465
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,980
It feels like a dream.

466
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:51,620
The panic will pass. These things never last. We'll get on your chest and we ride every

467
00:28:51,620 --> 00:29:12,180
part. And if we see. And when I bunny, the push should just breathe. And then I bunny, the

468
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:22,340
we will just be. Just breathe. And let yourself feel.

469
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:37,220
Divide it you stand. The united you stole. That's how it works, but it makes no sense at all.

470
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:52,660
Whenever you fall. Take every clichÃ© that said people say, the books on your shelf,

471
00:29:52,660 --> 00:30:00,980
but tell you how to live your day. And throw them away.

472
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:18,980
And when I bunny, the push should just breathe. And then I bunny, the people just be.

473
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:31,460
And if it feels that you are trembling down. Just hold on. There is a chance if you can

474
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:49,220
go to sleep. All will be well if you breathe. I think you say, nothing's okay. It's harder each day just to chase your face away.

475
00:30:50,180 --> 00:31:08,340
It feels like a dream. The panic will pass. These things never last. We'll get on your chest and we ride every part.

476
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:28,500
And if we see. And when I bunny, the push should just breathe. And then I bunny, the

477
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:45,300
we will just be. Just breathe. We're alive and we're free. We can touch and feel. And so I bunny,

478
00:31:45,300 --> 00:32:00,980
that we should just breathe. And just be. And let your left be.

479
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:11,540
Rachel Foller, Pete Townsend, just breathe. You can find a link to it on dailysourcecode.com.
