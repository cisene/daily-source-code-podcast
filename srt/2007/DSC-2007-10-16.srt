1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In a world where women were comfortable shoes and technology has changed the way you get your entertainment.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is the pod show network, no big media, no excuses, no BS.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Delta Chericharley 673.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
$60 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In the next generation, when you coach anyone here, you should believe in me.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I like the thing I'm trying to make sure I don't be hard-casting.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's very curry.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I never throw bar just to see the stars and with some face, I can't be bar.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I never bother to read about all the movies.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I never bought hype for MTV.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I mean, Oscar weren't nice to me.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But what do I love to care about your sanity?

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The sea up face gets near the end time.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, it's not for me to find the power to rise.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Get to you.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So now I wonder, when do we go?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And the time isn't like the feeling it lasts forever.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So now I wonder, when do we go?

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And the time isn't like the feeling it lasts forever.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But do what you can to make some noise.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But try to make it believe it what you do.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And midnight hats are all the same.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You're wearing a mask without any shame.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You need them all to believe that you're their fantasy.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
See our face stands still in time.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, it's not for me to find the power to rise.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Get to you.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So now I wonder, when do we go?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And the time isn't like the feeling it lasts forever.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So now I wonder, when do we go?

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And the time isn't like the feeling it lasts forever.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So now I wonder, when do we go?

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Girl, she knows

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why did the mirror change?

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What do you want to bring?

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Where's that girl she knows?

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Where did she go?

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,000
See your face dance still in time

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
World is not for me to find

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So I'll laugh at you

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's true

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So now I wonder

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What do as she goes?

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Stand by

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
When the time is in right

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The feeling is never

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So now I wonder

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What do as she goes?

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What do as she goes?

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What do as she goes?

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Just tickles my fancy

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I saw that

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
One of the top ten played songs

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This week from the pod save music

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now we're good

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Belmonds

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Where'd she go?

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Of course it's

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
DataSourceco.com in the show notes

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Interesting band from New York

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They've seen the buyer here

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They've shared the stage with such national artists

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
As collective soul, vertical horizon, mole

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Everclear and winger

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Winger

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
My goodness

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Ah guys

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You gotta let me know how

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Keep Winger's doing

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What do I have?

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I have a gold record

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And a platinum record on my wall

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
From back in the

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Back in the good old Winger days

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Have kipking me a call

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000

Episode 673

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Gray Overcast Day

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Here at the manner

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In Guilford on the west side of G-town

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm all spifed up

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Shavin

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't you think I

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Smell nice

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Nice and clean

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In the wife beaters of course

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't want to

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Scrunch up the shirt

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Got my black black jeans on

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Got my eggs on

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ready to bring you a show

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Just before I head off to the city

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What's this?

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We can't make a habit of doing too many shows a week now

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Everyone will get confused

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The N800 is load up with the loaded up

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
With shows to listen to on the commuter

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I've got a big meeting with

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Unilever

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Unilever

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Anglo Dutch company

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Who mainly make package goods

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So little things you consume

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And shiny packages they sell

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Worldwide

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think we're meeting with the homo brand

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, make all the jokes you want

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Meeting with the homo brand today

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hopefully we'll turn something good

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
For the UK and maybe worldwide

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Those guys are pretty aggressive

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll tell you that

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Actually I should say gals

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It seems like the entire building

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Which is this beautiful

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Building on the Victoria

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Enbankment in South

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I think it's Southwest London

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
In the Unilever house

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's wall to wall women who run the show

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There and I have to say they're all pretty hot

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So I'm going along for the ride

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
For the meeting today

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Four o'clock this afternoon

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Lots of stuff to do

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And before I forget

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I had this promo

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've been floating around my desktop

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And into my DSC folders

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And somehow I didn't get it

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Into the show in the past couple days

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So please let me

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let me play this for you

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Coming 31st of October 2007

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's a big number

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What is it?

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
One of my STD

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh for God's Satan

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They come trying to record a serious promo

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
For Adam to play on his show

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll take you on about the pod zones

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And in 50

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Coincidentally on Halloween

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Sorry, let's get that cheap plug in there

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No problem

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We're going to be almost as old as I'm in carrying

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Talking of width

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You have a sender thing

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's just glad I'm in the end

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
When you should say that I was Satan for Halloween

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Good call

153
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That way you can look at the pictures

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Whilst listen to the pod zones 50 episode

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
See, I can do cheap plugs too

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh nice

157
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And he can download it from podzone.bt podshow.com

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Exactly

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The podzone 50

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's a big number

161
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Podzone.bt podshow.com

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh and Adam

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You know, fuck you

164
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
God!

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Thank you

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Lovely

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Ah, that makes me feel good

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And alive and loved

169
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
One other show I want to bring your attention to

170
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
His blabbermouth TV

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is sponsored by CoverGirl

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Makeup

173
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's kind of like

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The view for teenage girls

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Produced by podshow

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think it but you know

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Three teenage girls who really are into this shit

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Well of course it includes a lot of Brittany

179
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And Lindsey low hand and

180
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Fashion and stuff

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And of course

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Makeup tips

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So I guess see if I can turn Christine on to that

184
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
See if I can get her to endorse it

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Blabbermouth.podshow.com

186
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So the the past couple of shows

187
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Starting with last week and certainly

188
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Last Friday

189
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Have stirred up quite a bit of controversy

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
On the phone lines

191
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Lots of different opinions

192
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Of course the focus has been very specific

193
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You know we've gone from

194
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Conspiracy theories to

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Skullfuck the rotting corpse of the TSA

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
By the way

197
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That never will go away

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
At least

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Not my attitude towards him

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Into

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Presidential elections in the United States

202
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's what it has done

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Is it significantly

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Made the numbers jump up on

205
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Download requests for the show

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Although I can't really see what happened yesterday

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Something must be broken or whatever

208
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
God you have no idea how how

209
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Massive

210
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The amount of data is that comes in for stats

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And has to be processing

212
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Whole separate unit now

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Like three people

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Called the big number project

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Who do nothing but massage and crunch

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And try to detect the anomalies

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And oh man it's it's quite a big deal

218
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So anyway so I don't know how yes

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So they did but I did put in my what

220
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We'll get to all that stuff later

221
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
First let me

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's check in with with you guys

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The audience who who do have some opinions

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
About what's going on with with your

225
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Cha Cha

226
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I'm

227
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm really feeling the sucks

228
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm driving and it's raining

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But anyway I'm just listening to

230
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Monday show here and I heard that you were

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Thinking about back here on fall

232
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And so we can check those websites

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Seems like a pretty candid

234
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Everything is getting

235
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Internet presence is doing twitter

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He's got youtube videos

237
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He's even doing

238
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Looks like just in TV

239
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's all low and good

240
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But I don't like the idea of an independent company such as

241
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Potso

242
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And your whole thing about being independent

243
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And all this backing

244
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
A politician

245
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Whoa

246
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Stop right there my friend

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, let me make it very clear

248
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
All the opinions expressed on the daily source code

249
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Our mine and mine only

250
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And there's no influence

251
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Either way

252
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
From me to Potso or Potso to me

253
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I think that's pretty evident by the fact that

254
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I only do shows when I can do them

255
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So it's not like

256
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm being forced to pump out shows

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I would never

258
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Never have Potso take any kind of political stance for any reason whatsoever

259
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So this is this is all entirely me my friend

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And of course that is the most difficult part of my life

261
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Is separating this part of my life

262
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Which is really talking to an audience

263
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
An audience I love dearly

264
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You are my psychiatrist

265
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're the only ones I get to really

266
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Really open up to when it comes to a whole bunch of issues

267
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That quite frankly other people in my life

268
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
For just not interested in or bored

269
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So I'd have to correct you there

270
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm not asking Potso to put any resources behind this

271
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This will just be solely me

272
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Just to set that straight

273
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And telling everyone else that we should do and racing money for them

274
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
No, no, no, I'm not telling anybody anything

275
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Dude, I'm just talking here, okay?

276
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Seems like you're going into the whole corporate thing

277
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That you were trying to get us all to go away from

278
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Talk about what?

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What?

280
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Money in all this

281
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And then you're telling us that

282
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Maybe we could race some money for one of these candidates

283
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But just a

284
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't seem to fit

285
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So uh

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, okay

287
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Look

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I desperately want the system to change

289
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm over here in the UK and just as an example

290
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I feel very loved by the British people

291
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I feel very welcome by the British people

292
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But the one thing they all say without fail is

293
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We hate your president

294
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We hate your president

295
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We hate that he dragged Tony Blair into his crap

296
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We hate that

297
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The UK and the USA are so entwined

298
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Into all of these

299
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Global issues that really just

300
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I know the crap out of every citizen as far as I can tell

301
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So I want to change that

302
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I desperately want to change that

303
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And it's my responsibility

304
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Obviously as an American citizen to help change that

305
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And to evaluate

306
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And if I think that there's someone out there with the right message

307
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm going to back that person

308
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Not as a podcaster

309
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But as a human being as a citizen as a world citizen actually

310
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
How can anyone argue with a lot of the points that Ron Paul is making

311
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Get out of Iraq

312
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Is that what everyone wants?

313
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Isn't that what 75% of the country wants?

314
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Or do we want to go with the

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
With the Hillary

316
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Slash any other Democrat

317
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I mean any other Democratic agenda

318
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Which is 2013

319
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
2010

320
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Come on

321
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So

322
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah

323
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You've got to use the system in order to take over

324
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You have to use it

325
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So the way the system still works in America today

326
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Is by advertising

327
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's how you get your agenda

328
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Push through

329
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's how you

330
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's how we buy

331
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Washing powder

332
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Is by repetition of advertising

333
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Quite honestly

334
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It just works

335
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I hate to tell you

336
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Sometimes a really good ad

337
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Will do

338
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Will do very well

339
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Just by itself

340
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And that of course is what

341
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What I believe the future of advertising will be

342
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Is just turning it into great content

343
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Just one other thing

344
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
While I'm on that topic

345
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
A couple people sent me this

346
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let me see if I can find it here

347
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This is from the independent

348
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll put a link in the show notes

349
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This article

350
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh

351
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
All that

352
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Google notebook is failing

353
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The ones again

354
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Here we go

355
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Apparently

356
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Over a ten month period

357
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
At least 77 television stations

358
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We're making use of so-called

359
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Video news releases

360
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
VNRs

361
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And these are

362
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Frequently put together by

363
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The healthcare industry

364
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But also by

365
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The Bush administration

366
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Apparently

367
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And what it is

368
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's a pre-packaged news item

369
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That you just send out

370
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's like an electronic press kit

371
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
If you know what those are

372
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So you get some video

373
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You get a slug

374
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Which is like a story line

375
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And what these 77 stations

376
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Have been doing is literally taking

377
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
These video news reports from

378
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It says the Bush administration

379
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Not quite sure what that means

380
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But these segments have been

381
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
About the success of the war

382
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And Iraq

383
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And of course the healthcare

384
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Video news releases

385
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Have been about a great product

386
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That they happened to own and be selling

387
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And it's illegal

388
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You cannot

389
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
On public airways

390
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You cannot

391
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
To take a commercial endorsement paid for

392
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
By someone else

393
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And presented his news

394
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So

395
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
There's a lot going on in media

396
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And we're just not quite powerful enough

397
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I don't think

398
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Although it seems like the internet

399
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Is doing quite well

400
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
For Ron Paul in fundraising

401
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The way to do it is still the old

402
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Fashioned way with advertising

403
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's just the fact I can't

404
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Can't help it

405
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah

406
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah

407
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I was

408
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The slug

409
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And

410
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah

411
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah

412
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Thank you

413
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It doesn't matter what you say

414
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
As long as you end up

415
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The call that way

416
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I just feel good about you

417
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Very concerned about our

418
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Buddy James

419
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Who

420
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I think he's been going through

421
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Kind of a rough patch himself

422
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Had some offline email

423
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Conversations

424
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He's been yelling at me

425
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And I'm like dude

426
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What's going on

427
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I got up on the wrong side of bed

428
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But yesterday he called in

429
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Or maybe it was last night

430
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I do want to share this one with you

431
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But again I'm trying again

432
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Not a copy now

433
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm just trying again

434
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Because I'm not annoyed

435
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm just so dismayed with you

436
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Because as I said before

437
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
There's something change with Adam Curry

438
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Very recently

439
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't know if it's

440
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Potual and it's success

441
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And the money's rolling in

442
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And Mr. Curry's change is attitude

443
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I know you're a rich man

444
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I know you've never pushed that in

445
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
People's faces

446
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But just something seems to change with you

447
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Wow

448
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay

449
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So you know

450
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
This is again

451
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I said earlier

452
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I love you guys

453
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So whenever a loved one says to you

454
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You've changed

455
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That is pretty much the first

456
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Conversation before a breakup

457
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So I'm extremely worried about what James is saying here

458
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
However

459
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Whatever has changed

460
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
James, I'm sure you're about to tell us

461
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't forget

462
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I am a human being

463
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Human beings go through life

464
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And discover things

465
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And morph themselves

466
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And change and become an image

467
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
They want to be

468
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And

469
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And I'm fucking human

470
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So let's see what the problem is with that

471
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The whole American thing

472
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The whole Youngspirce

473
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The Brits seems to be an underlying

474
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Current in the Daily Source

475
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Code

476
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
No, that's when the Brits ring

477
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah, okay

478
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Partly have something

479
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Partly have something

480
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Partly say about mountains

481
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But the attitude was no

482
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You're wrong

483
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No, you're wrong

484
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You're wrong

485
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
No, no, no, no, no

486
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't think I said that

487
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
James, I think what I said is

488
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
To quote statistics

489
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Comparing a country with

490
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
300 million people

491
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And to the number of

492
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Gun related deaths

493
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Versus a country of

494
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
6 million people

495
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Is not a fair comparison

496
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You need to do it by percentage

497
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
This is nothing to do with

498
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The ranks versus Brits

499
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This just has to do with statistics

500
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No, no, no, no

501
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Not one little bit

502
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
We're not seeing where right

503
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We're not seeing that

504
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Great Britain's fantastic

505
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because there's a lot of alcohol

506
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
No, we're not

507
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They're not right

508
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But you're not right

509
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Actually, I think that's one of the

510
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Bonus is of the United Kingdom

511
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
When you guys drink alcohol

512
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You get fantastically

513
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Funny, so I see that as a plus

514
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Actually

515
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Golden Guns and the story

516
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It isn't a right

517
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
There, it shouldn't be there

518
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Guns should be banned

519
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
For stop the river

520
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No, man

521
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Okay, let's ban guns

522
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Full stop the river

523
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Then you know

524
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Look at the amount of guns out there

525
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And what we're actually doing with them

526
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And I'll just say we as the United

527
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
States

528
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I won't even involve Britain

529
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Even though you're still in Iraq

530
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And you're still in Afghanistan

531
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And so if guns are evil

532
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Then let's stop it across the board

533
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You know, or

534
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Grab

535
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Unfortunately, James

536
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's a right that was put into the

537
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Constitution of the United States of America

538
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's only a couple hundred years old

539
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's the rules of our country

540
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And if you don't like the rules of the country

541
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Don't come to America

542
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's okay, it's no problem

543
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I happen to believe that

544
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That it's a pretty interesting

545
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Amendment

546
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And don't necessarily have a problem with it

547
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Because, you know, even though I don't have guns

548
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I do believe that there's a reason for having them

549
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And wow, you know, we could have a whole argument about that

550
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But I'll just leave finish here

551
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
People in this story

552
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Now, guns don't kill people, people, people

553
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, exactly

554
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm just so, I don't know

555
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I've already emailed you about this

556
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And I kind of explained it in the other way

557
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's a very difficult thing to explain

558
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But Adam Curry's changed

559
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And the daily source code's changed

560
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And everything seems very American

561
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And you'll ask comment on the DSC

562
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And I know this is a long comment

563
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And I know you probably won't play it

564
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But enjoy your freedom

565
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That is such a blink at American view

566
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Do you realize how many people in this world

567
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Don't have their freedom

568
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But still

569
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Ah

570
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
James

571
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yes, of course I realize that

572
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Those of you who have it

573
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Should be happy with it

574
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Enjoy your freedom

575
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Absolutely

576
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Enjoy your freedom to walk around

577
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And travel

578
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And have commerce

579
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
With other people and countries

580
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And yeah, enjoy your freedom

581
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What's wrong with saying that

582
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
If you have it, you should be very happy

583
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
If you're really happy about having freedom

584
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Perhaps you'll help other people gain freedom as well

585
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Listen to the daily source code

586
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
My big steel and borrowed it

587
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
To get a bit of the outside world

588
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Enjoy your freedom

589
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
God, that's a fucking stupid thing to say

590
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Huh?

591
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm not even going to bother saying

592
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Fuck you, I don't care

593
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Fuck you, I'm fucking horrible

594
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And if you think it's funny

595
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Sorry

596
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Sorry, it's the fucking thing that's funny

597
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Dude

598
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You're free, you're free, man

599
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
If you're not, let me know

600
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
How you're enslaved

601
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And yes, of course

602
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
If part of enjoying your freedom is

603
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
If possible, helping other people

604
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Enjoy theirs

605
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
A couple other comments on the gun stuff

606
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Hey Adam

607
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I just heard the message from Barkey

608
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Commanding on guns in the United States

609
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's killing too many people

610
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm currently in Switzerland

611
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And I heard that Switzerland

612
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
As even less strict laws than the USA

613
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm a self from

614
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
From the Netherlands, so I'm not too sure about

615
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What exactly the thing is

616
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But it seems that there are over

617
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Three million automatic rifles in Switzerland

618
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Owned by people keeping them in their house

619
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And it's even the case that when Swiss males

620
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Sign off from their tour of duty

621
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That they get to take your gun home

622
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So, if you want to look at it, percentage vice

623
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Probably Switzerland will beat the USA

624
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But still there are not as many shootings

625
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
As far as I can see here in Switzerland

626
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And there are in America

627
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Perhaps it is the people killing people instead of guns

628
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So, as I say

629
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Now I get the hell out of Switzerland

630
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a calculator

631
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's an interesting alternative ending there

632
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yeah, so there you go

633
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Clearly there are other problems of foot in the United States

634
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
If that's true

635
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And I believe it is

636
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm sure it is

637
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
There's a whole bunch of other problems going on

638
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I think the war on drugs

639
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Probably fosters more gunfire and gun killings

640
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And anything else

641
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But that's just my twisted reality

642
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I guess one more about guns killing people

643
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Hi, it's Dean from Tom Bezier California

644
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Are you doing?

645
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Just so I don't forget later

646
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's fuck you

647
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Wow, nice, nice, nice alternative

648
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yes

649
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Now I'm listening to conversation about guns

650
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
United States and all of line

651
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
A couple things from the mind

652
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Guns don't kill people

653
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
People do that

654
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's a great book

655
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Take the idea of the day

656
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's basically

657
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Guns kill people

658
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The same way spoons

659
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Made Rosie a Donald bat

660
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Now there's that going too

661
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But really I think if you go back to the reason

662
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Not for fathers

663
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Gave us the right to their arms

664
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
One of the reasons was

665
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
If you were living in England at the time

666
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The only people could have a gun

667
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You could hunt

668
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Where the lords of the manor

669
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So to speak

670
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Nobody else was allowed to do that

671
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That was one of the reasons

672
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That we were

673
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Allowed to carry our arms

674
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And we could go out and hunt

675
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Nobody could keep us from doing that

676
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
For feeding our families

677
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The other reason was

678
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
If we got invaded

679
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
We all had guns

680
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So there was that too

681
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So that's a really good point right there

682
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And I'm just going by the constitution of the United States for a second

683
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
This is actually something

684
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Somewhere I saw a video

685
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Where Ron Paul said this as well

686
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And it may sound really twisted

687
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
This logic

688
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But just bear with me for a second

689
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Okay

690
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So the original idea I agree

691
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Was to protect from any enemy

692
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Outside or within

693
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's very critical

694
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Because I believe that the real enemy of the United States right now

695
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Is inside inside the White House

696
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Inside

697
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Capital building

698
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's inside

699
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So the right to bear arms

700
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Of course to provide and hunt

701
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And all that stuff

702
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But yes, it was intended to protect

703
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So if anyone showed up

704
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And said

705
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
We're invading

706
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
We say, oh yeah

707
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Well why don't I put a cap in your ass

708
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Motherfucker

709
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And if you kind of

710
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Take that all the way through

711
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Well to 9-11

712
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
This is what I saw Ron Paul saying

713
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And as weird as it sounds

714
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I really feel kind of good about the statement

715
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
If the airlines had been able to exercise their constitutional rights

716
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And had been able to protect

717
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Their customers

718
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
By

719
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Allowing pilots to have guns

720
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Or having some other form of security

721
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Which I do believe is their responsibility

722
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Not the government

723
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's their responsibility

724
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Just like the trains are responsible

725
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
For protecting its customers

726
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Which they don't do

727
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I might add

728
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Just as buses

729
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Or the tube

730
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I think of you know

731
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
These services are all responsible for taking care of their passengers

732
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
If there had been guns in the cockpit in 9-11

733
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Boxcutters

734
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Clearly would have been no match

735
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And it might have had a different outcome

736
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That's one way to look at it

737
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Or you get completely outraged

738
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And

739
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And I do buy into that

740
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We have a different idea of why they're guns around now

741
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Are there gangs?

742
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Are there people that shouldn't have them

743
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Absolutely

744
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But if you make guns, you'll equal to half

745
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Can only people that are going to have them

746
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Are the bad guys

747
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And that's a fact

748
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Because they're going to get them

749
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And that they're what

750
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
There's always going to be a black market for whatever

751
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Government says you can't have

752
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You can't have marijuana

753
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
If they tell you you can't have

754
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Have booze

755
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Those guys come in

756
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And can't have these

757
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Lots of money

758
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Doing exactly that

759
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But made those people rich

760
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So yeah

761
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
What's much illegalized guns

762
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And make the bad guys the most powerful people around

763
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Because they'll be the only ones with it

764
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
All right

765
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Hey, that's my ramp for the day I'll talk to you later

766
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm a thank you

767
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh boy

768
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
This is a very trippy

769
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Trippy

770
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Very tricky subject indeed

771
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Because obviously guns are dangerous

772
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Obviously

773
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But you know, it's the law of the land

774
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's what was laid down

775
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's what was set up by the founding fathers

776
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And I think they had a lot of things right

777
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And you know what these guys were fucking revolutionaries

778
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
They were rebels

779
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
They were definitely not your standard fair citizens

780
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Adam Curry

781
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah

782
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I've called you several times throughout the years

783
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And this Chris

784
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
From Seattle

785
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Post the car cast and I

786
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Call you throughout the years several times about different things

787
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I don't think I've ever called you angry before

788
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But today I call you very pissed off

789
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You've said a lot of things on your show

790
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But I've never heard anything as ass-in-ine

791
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And that you must endorse a presidential candidate

792
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Hello

793
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Who the hell do you think you are

794
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And doors again today

795
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Who are you?

796
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Ted Koppel

797
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Adam Curry

798
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You're the leader of the free world

799
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
There's a leader of podcap

800
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You're the pod fodder

801
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
There's a red pill guy

802
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You're like doors up to the candidate

803
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Guys it's flipping out and pulling it out

804
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's gonna be

805
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You don't endorse a candidate

806
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
No?

807
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah, that's not part of the red pill

808
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
That's blue pill

809
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
In doors to candidate

810
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Give me a break

811
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You've fallen back into the old ways

812
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So let the plus turn you back into the MTV guy you were before

813
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Poor dad

814
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
In doors to candidate

815
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Give me a break

816
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Okay

817
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Well, yeah

818
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think I'm gonna endorse Ron Paul

819
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And I don't understand what's wrong with it

820
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Otherwise I'm just a talker like everybody else

821
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
You know I'm a doer

822
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I like to get out there and do things

823
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I like to make shit happen

824
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
There's a guy fucking 72 years old

825
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I like the most unlikely guy in the world

826
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I don't think that this is far beyond my

827
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
My traditional motis operandi

828
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I think it's exactly what I should be doing

829
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And I'll go to the mat for this guy

830
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
By the way, I did send off an email

831
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
To don over at the Ron Paul camp

832
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We're so nice to get back and touch with me

833
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And let me know that they love to have them on the show

834
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
No answer yet to the email

835
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So I'm gonna wait for the rest of the day to pass

836
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And then I guess I'll just try a phone call

837
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So far no luck on that

838
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Oh Adam Jason from San Diego

839
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's funny you're talking about what's at Ron Paul

840
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And driving around San Diego

841
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Not too long ago maybe two or three days ago

842
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I've just seen a few cars

843
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And a few signs

844
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
With little cars with signs on them

845
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm sorry

846
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Cars with little magnet signs on

847
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm in signs and people jarred to say

848
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Google Ron Paul

849
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
That's it

850
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And it has a little very very tiny tiny letters

851
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Ron Paul for president

852
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But in big huge letters, Google Ron Paul

853
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So I thought it was an opposite campaign

854
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You know, to find out what's going wrong with this guy

855
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But turns out that's the way he's doing his grassroots

856
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Thought it was interesting, you brought it up

857
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Like

858
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Yeah, okay, please remember how to end all of your comments

859
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Did you call him?

860
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It's quite annoying when you don't

861
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Because there's nothing to laugh at at the end

862
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah, I think he's got a pretty good viral campaign

863
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Going right now

864
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
He's trying to raise a 12 million dollars

865
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
When he comes on the show

866
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm going to ask him how he's going to spend it

867
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
What he's going to spend it on

868
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I love the idea of removing

869
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The federal reserve and the IRS

870
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And I can't wait to ask him about how he's going to go about that

871
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I think that this guy would be a transitional president

872
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
He would have to be there for at least four years

873
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
To get things underway, get things in motion

874
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Increase the what looks to me like a title wave

875
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Of enthusiasm for constitutionalism in the United States

876
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
By the way, you may not agree with

877
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
If you live outside the US or you're not an American citizen

878
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But I think it's a great way to go

879
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And I've been watching these debates

880
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
No one can argue with it

881
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You just can't argue the constitution

882
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
In fact, if some of the video I saw clearly from a Ron Paul supporter

883
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And she held up a little booklet

884
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Maybe, you know, like a pamphlet almost

885
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Like the size of

886
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I would say that it was the size of like the tube guide

887
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
In London only it was thinner

888
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And that's the constitution of the United States

889
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And then she held up next to it

890
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
This huge, you know, unwieldy

891
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Encyclopedic feeling volume

892
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
This tone

893
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And that was the internal revenue code

894
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The tax code of the United States

895
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Which by far outweighs outstrips

896
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And out, outgroses

897
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The constitution is just unbelievable

898
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And that really hit home for me

899
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That's a tax payer I might add

900
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Hey Adam, it's Mark from Boulder

901
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Just calling to let you know

902
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
That before I forget, yes

903
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
As an American citizen, regardless of where you live

904
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Regardless of where you pay taxes

905
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You still have to file an income tax form

906
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
With the United States

907
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Which I do do to flee

908
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Just lessen to the Charlie here

909
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Moment of Go

910
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
672

911
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And Aaron Russo's film

912
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
America, Freedom to Fascism

913
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Is available

914
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
A Netflix

915
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And you can ask a watch

916
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It instantly I believe if you're in the US

917
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Which I did

918
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Back in March

919
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Second

920
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
As well the first films that I actually watched

921
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Off of Netflix and New Streaming Service

922
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So for people that are Netflix subscribers

923
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
They can view it right then

924
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And there

925
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And I do recommend watching it

926
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It was very interesting and informative

927
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And what you didn't touch on

928
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
What it, the premise of its film

929
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Is what Aaron was trying to get to the bottom was

930
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Is why are Americans paying personal income tax?

931
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
No where in our constitution

932
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Or in law

933
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Does it specify that we need to pay personal income taxes

934
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Is that then he gets to know all the details

935
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
That there was reserve bank

936
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And there was a system

937
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And how this was all created

938
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And what a racket it is

939
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So people can find the full

940
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Film on Netflix

941
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah

942
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Ciao

943
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Thank you

944
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Yeah

945
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
That was homework I gave you on

946
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
The other day

947
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You definitely need to go watch that film

948
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
This is not just some

949
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Conspiracy theory thing

950
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Throne together

951
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
From different pieces of information

952
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
In fact I see pieces from this documentary

953
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Used in others

954
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's very well done

955
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It really only applies

956
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
If you're an American citizen

957
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But if you're a world citizen

958
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It does give you view

959
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Into how the finances

960
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The world work currently

961
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And where they're going

962
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And that is without a doubt

963
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
A follow the money

964
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Mission my friends

965
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yes Adam

966
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
This is at noise from a fearful island

967
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I just wanted to encourage you to

968
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Do whatever you can to support

969
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Rom Paul

970
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Check into what he's doing

971
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
On YouTube

972
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And other things

973
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And realize that he's got this massive

974
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Following and it's just growing

975
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Comatically

976
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
For example

977
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
He's raising more money from

978
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Soldiers

979
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And I rack them all

980
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Of the other Republican candidates

981
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Combined

982
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That tells you something about

983
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
What they think

984
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Many other big huge issues

985
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So I hope you can help them out

986
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Thanks a lot

987
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Right on

988
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And you know what

989
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It's just impossible to argue

990
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
With a guy who's been an OBGYN

991
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
An obstetrician

992
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
For so long

993
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Has delivered over 4,000 babies

994
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's the kind of guy you actually

995
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You're okay

996
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
If he examines your wife's vagina

997
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So this is a guy who I can

998
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You know

999
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Bill Clinton might have won

1000
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Do that

1001
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But this guy is in a different league

1002
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And

1003
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That gives me great comfort

1004
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
All right something else here

1005
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah

1006
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Enough of that

1007
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Hopefully those guys will call

1008
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And we'll get Ron Paul on this week

1009
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It doesn't look like it's going to be until

1010
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Thursday or Friday at this pace

1011
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But I'm looking for that to happen

1012
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Brand new target cast

1013
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
We're running in partnership with Partita

1014
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Toquila

1015
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You've probably heard the spots

1016
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Running on the network

1017
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's on the Tequila Trail

1018
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Chef Mark

1019
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Friend of the show here

1020
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Went to Mexico

1021
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Film the harvesting

1022
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And distillation process

1023
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Of the agave plant

1024
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I think it's pronounced agave isn't it

1025
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
That's the fruit

1026
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
From which

1027
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Tequila is harvested

1028
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
This is at the Partita Ranch

1029
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's episode one episode two

1030
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
They mix it all up

1031
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And make some really cool

1032
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Tequila drinks

1033
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So you can take a look at that

1034
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
On the Tequila Trail dot

1035
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Potcho dot com

1036
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Is it advertising?

1037
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah

1038
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Is it content?

1039
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yeah

1040
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
What is it?

1041
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Potcho

1044

1052
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And you thought the US was bad

1053
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
CSB is now recording his entry

1054
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Into the United Kingdom on audio

1055
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And he's pissed off about his treatment

1056
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Hi Adam Boy

1057
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Say

1058
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
When your wife

1059
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Who is Dutch

1060
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Is entering UK

1061
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Is British immigration

1062
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
If he's asking her

1063
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Where is she coming from?

1064
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yes

1065
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
They do

1066
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
However

1067
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That's about all they ask

1068
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
They never ask how long she's going to stay

1069
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Or anything like that

1070
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I get a hell of a lot more questions

1071
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I mean I get like interrogated

1072
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Every single time

1073
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But no, they only ask her where she's coming from

1074
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Just listen to this

1075
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Do you have a mother?

1076
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Do you have a mother?

1077
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Do you have a mother?

1078
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Do you have a mother?

1079
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Okay

1080
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Do you have a mother?

1081
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
No

1082
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But I don't know

1083
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You don't have a mother, right?

1084
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And you don't have a mother, right?

1085
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Because if I say this, then I have to

1086
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Okay

1087
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Okay

1088
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Just listen to this

1089
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And even if you can't make any difference

1090
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But what do you call?

1091
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You can't call me when you are on your way

1092
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So you haven't

1093
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Dude, you do not want to mess around with those people

1094
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You always want to be smiling

1095
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I always take off my sunglasses

1096
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You always want to be nice to him

1097
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Did you hear that?

1098
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It doesn't make any difference

1099
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Where you're from

1100
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I need to know where you're from

1101
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,560
From Chile.

1102
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,120
Correct yourself.

1103
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,760
That's just because I am a new EU citizen.

1104
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,000
I'll be it.

1105
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,680
Born in a country that has 1,100 years of history.

1106
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,280
I'm treated as white Negro,

1107
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,760
by British migration.

1108
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,880
How does that mean?

1109
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,880
Old EU citizens are not being asked this question at all.

1110
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,720
No CSB.

1111
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,160
That's just not an analogy that is appropriate.

1112
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,680
I understand what you're saying.

1113
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,200
What you're saying is you're being discriminated against because you are from a different

1114
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,440
EU country.

1115
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,840
And yes, it's crazy.

1116
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:39,280
If the European Union means it's supposed to be like the United States of Europe, can

1117
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,640
you just imagine that happening in the US.

1118
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,800
Welcome to Texas.

1119
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,880
What state did you come from?

1120
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Why?

1121
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
What are you doing?

1122
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,440
I don't want to stay here.

1123
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,280
I think we're not far off from that happening in the US, actually, if we don't watch

1124
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
out.

1125
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,640
So clearly work to be done in the European Union.

1126
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:03,320
So the motto of this fairytale is, there is no old and new EU.

1127
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,120
There is one EU.

1128
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:14,080
And let us all treat each other equally, or if we cannot, let's dissolve EU now.

1129
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,680
Let's stop pretending that there is any community.

1130
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:27,800
And Adam, let's treat each other with respect without incency or fuck you.

1131
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
OK.

1132
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Let's say it.

1133
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
You.

1134
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,400
Our EU correspondent ladies and gentlemen, the one and only comic strip blog.

1135
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:43,680
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic

1136
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:50,160
strip, comic strip, comic strip.

1137
00:37:50,160 --> 00:38:02,040
1, 2, 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7, 7.

1138
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
Hey, Adam.

1139
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:12,160
This is Blake Morgan from New York CityCon, just want to check in and give you the good news.

1140
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:19,760
We just got words that following your debut of Maybemma made on the Daily Source Code, we got

1141
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:26,160
6,000 paid downloads on the e-m music in the first six weeks following that debut.

1142
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:33,120
So we are still riding high from riding the pod safe music network wave here and more importantly

1143
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:38,160
your support and your spin and debut of that song on the Daily Source Code.

1144
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,920
So 6,000 downloads in six weeks is a great start and we are thrilled that just continues to prove

1145
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,200
that what bands like Radiohead and Ninestale have already figured out that there is no need to

1146
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:59,520
count out to Giganta Radio or to large, rotten, terrible record labels that pod casting and

1147
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,120
the internet and all the stuff that the rest of us already know is really the way to go, especially

1148
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:11,600
when we have people like you on our side. So to kind of celebrate that and also with the Radiohead

1149
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,240
thing, I've uploaded three more songs to the PMN from my acoustic album of silence there,

1150
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,720
including a very special authorized cover to follow in the tradition of Maybemma made.

1151
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,120
So I want to thank you, give you the good news, keep it coming, look what you're doing, it's incredible.

1152
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Take care Adam, I'll talk to you soon.

1153
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:47,120
For love like a landfill, a job that slowly kills you,

1154
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,200
who says that word here.

1155
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:16,800
You look so tired and happy, brave down the government, they don't, they don't speak for

1156
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,800
us.

1157
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:45,440
All day, a quiet life, a handshake of carbon, a knockside, with no alums, and no surprises, no alums,

1158
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:56,080
and no surprises, no alums, and no surprises,

1159
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:24,400
silence, silence, this is my final fit, my final beliac, with no alums,

1160
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:41,040
and no surprises, no alums, and no surprises, no alums, and no surprises,

1161
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:15,680
no surprises, no surprises, no surprises, no surprises,

1162
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:41,280
no surprises, no surprises, no alums, and no surprises, no surprises, no surprises,

1163
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,400
a beautiful song, a beautiful story from Lake Morgan, no surprises, his authorized radiohead cover,

1164
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,680
which is available on the pod safe music network. There you go, it's taken three years, but we are

1165
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,120
definitely whipping the music industry's ass, publishing industry is next, and we'll get to media,

1166
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:06,800
and oh yes, maybe one day we will save the world and win valuable prizes. Let's find out tomorrow

1167
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,560
together, adamotpodshow.com, dailysourceco.com, hey, fuck it, enjoy your freedom.
