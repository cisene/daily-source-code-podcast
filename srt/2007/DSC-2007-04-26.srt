Serator.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Five, eight, nineer.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In a world where TV networks, movies, studios, and record labels still think they can govern what you see in here.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses and make big media corporations

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
wet their tiny little pants.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
From Poncho, polled up the world's most dangerous new content comes the daily source code with Adam Curry.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We don't need no sticky drinks.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Autistic.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's Adam Curry.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
To take your phone so long, it was just as long way.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So long, it won't make me feel like you were once dead.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
To take your phone so long, it was gonna save me.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I've never seen you again.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I've come to see you again.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I've come to see you again.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We have so much to come and deal with.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We used to talk about all kinds of things.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I remember everything you said to me.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You made some problems with such things.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
God keeps on being okay.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
To take your phone so long, it was just as long way.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So long it won't make me feel like you were once dead.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
To take your phone so long, it was gonna save me.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I've never seen you again.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've come to see you again.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I've come to see you again.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
To take your phone so long, it was just as long way.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So long it won't make me feel like you were once dead.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
To take your phone so long, it was just as long way.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So long it won't make me feel like you were once dead.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
To take your phone so long, it was gonna save me.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So long it won't make me feel like you were once dead.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
To take your phone so long, it was gonna save me.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Something about the hand flap, it's almost like a child girl.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Just face.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Arthur Eurea, someone like you just is lonely.

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This guy's got a whole mess of songs in the pod save music network.

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And I listen to every single one of my, I think I added at least three to them to my special playlist

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
because they're all just that good.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's a daily source code coming to you from the Curri condo in Northern California, San Francisco, California.

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's episode number 589.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And man, what an odd deal to get ready for the show these days.

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So I'm so definitely afraid of the headphone earlobe that I actually, I got to take a picture of this.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I stick like gauze with medical tape underneath my earlobe so that the headphone just can't rub against the sensitive, my sensitive areas.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You know what they are ladies, don't you?

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I was thinking it's like I'm like I'm ramming a tampon in there and then hit me.

58
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That's actually what I need.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The tampon will be a great idea.

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So tomorrow I'm going to try it.

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And I think I need like the, the obese won't work.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It has to be like a tampax.

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It has to be, I don't have to do long enough, but just something like,

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and handy with a string I can wrap it around my ear so it'll stay in place.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh my goodness.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Good night.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm my host.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This is the right message service because this is a generic message.

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm Darren from Melbourne, Australia.

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm first time calling a long timelessness.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Quick coming about your headphone in your ear infection.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There's just a good chance that there's a bunch of bacteria on the headphone care.

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And you just get some effect of those different things in life.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And keep them, completely clean.

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And then you might not have much more.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So it's over here.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
All right, man.

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
All right.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
First time call us or let you slide.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It was just so nice to hear from somebody down under again.

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It dude, when you're driving your car or as you would say,

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
when you're back in the youth, that's not a good time to call.

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's very difficult to understand.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But you made a good point there.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And this is something Yvonne Patricia Sister even called to say.

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And she said, you know, you really got to disinfect these pads on the earphones

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
because if there's any just dirt or bacteria or nastiness on it,

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
that could be causing the problem.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Absolutely.

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But right now, I'm way beyond that.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You know, I've had pain.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I've had suffering.

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I've had an operational procedure take place.

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oops.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hold on a second.

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I can see the virus softwares scanning.

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's not a good idea while you're recording.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I never really caused any problems.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But why invite Murphy into our lives, huh?

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So tampons.

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll try that.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Now Arthur, you're a by the way from the Houston, Texas.

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Born in Chicago.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Great stuff.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Love it.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's a hand clap song these days.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm not quite sure what it is.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So I'm late.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It is now.

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What is it?

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's 1215.

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Very late for me to be doing the show.

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's been going so well.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Of course, we have another, uh, savant.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
From my circle of savants as I end the Sultan of said savants.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm going to talk about, uh, a very current topic.

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Uh, excuse me.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Tylenol P.N.

Check out unwind and GB's show sponsored by Tylenol at unwind.podshow.com.

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You will not regret it.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
To why am I late?

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, I've been promising for.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, man.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Weeks that I would do a Skype interview with Eric Bergen.

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Um, who plays Bob Godio in Jersey Boys.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Of course, uh, if you if you listen to the show, you know that he got me a ticket.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I want to check out the show.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I loved it very much.

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And now the things are runaway success.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And I just can't say enough good things about it.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Really enjoyed it.

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But we've never actually met.

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He does a podcast called Green Room Radio.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And his mom does a scrap cast.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
She does a scrap book, um, podcast.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And we've had a nice little email back and forth.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But he really wanted to interview me for his show.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And of course, I want to comply.

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But, uh, you know, he's working a night doing the show.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And during the day, I'm working, you know, just to, you know,

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to sit down and and do a, and interview, it's just hard to schedule that.

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Particularly just when the other week's and out here is really busy.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So he's been sick for the past couple days.

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He's actually been, uh, performing every single night for six months.

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think something like that.

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And to some of he's, he had a throat ache and bronchitis.

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And he wasn't feeling well.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So he, he took some time off and he deserved that.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And so yeah, so you know what, why don't you call me around nine o'clock.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I was working on all kinds of stuff.

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
We have a board of directors meeting tomorrow or today.

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Actually, when you're hearing this, you know, we always look forward to that.

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's a great moment for us to check ourselves.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So we're going through, uh, through our regular, uh, quarterly procedure.

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So it's busy.

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I said call me nine, um, and he does.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And we talk for an hour and a half.

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I did know he wanted to do like, it's like, it was like,

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
it was almost as if we were doing an episode of this is your life.

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But I kind of got into it, you know, and of course it was most of the energy that I intended

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
on spending on this show and it went into that interview.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But it was good at the questions and he really went back and he, uh,

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and he had done his research, his homework and, uh, I appreciate that.

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So, you know, we just talked and it was, and you know, he said he wasn't going to edit it.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And, uh, we were just having a very nice conversation the way that it works in, in our medium.

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There's no rush, no rush for, you know, we don't have to hit any news break at the top of the hour.

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We ever bought it.

169
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And I told him, because, you know, I've been, I know what, so let me tell you what I told him.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But look, I had an erotic dream and you were in it.

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And anyway, I just mentioned that, you know, me, I just mentioned that during the course of the interview

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and he kind of like brushed it aside.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And the reason why, of course, is because I've had his name in my mind, you know,

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
thinking about, I've got to hook up, you know, I, I,

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
things I have to remember, I can put in my brain.

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I remember them, they bug me and they keep popping it in my head.

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So I was probably just having an erotic dream period.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And then his name popped into my head, whatever.

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know, he's not a bad looking guy.

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And I'm just salacious.

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So anyway, so we're near the end of this interview.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And his girlfriend walks in.

183
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I would just, and he sent me this piece of the interview.

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So I'm sure it's going to be on green room radio soon or, or as soon as he edits it,

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm not quite sure what he's going to do with it.

186
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll put a link to that in the show notes of daily source code.com.

187
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But here's how the interview ended when his girlfriend answers.

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh, actually, he's knocking on the door.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I guess she doesn't have a key.

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And well, listen, you'll have, you'll have some fun with this.

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Sorry about that man. Go ahead, what were you saying?

192
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You got a booty call, didn't you?

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I was my girlfriend walked in.

194
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Told you, booty call.

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Is she, is she moved with you for, is she goes with you?

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Travels with you?

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
She's in the show. You saw her. She plays Franky's wife.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh, man.

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
She was in my dream too.

200
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
She was, you were an Adam Curry's dream.

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah.

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah.

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah.

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But so you Eric, so I don't want to know about him.

205
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No, no, no, no, no.

206
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh God.

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Tell her, tell her, tell her.

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I told her, you were, you were in the dream.

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Put her on.

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
She's coming, come here.

211
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What's her name?

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Jackie.

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
All right, you can, you can hear?

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Hey Jackie.

215
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes.

216
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
First of all, I loved you in the show.

217
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh, thank you.

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And listen, how good is this?

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Am I slick or what?

220
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What I forgot to say is, I really enjoy your work.

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Because that's what that, that's show business.

222
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I forgot to say that part, but I really loved you in the show.

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I mean, so I'm getting ready.

224
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Really?

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, I'm sure you heard it, but I was so blown away by just by everything.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Really, but you guys were fantastic.

227
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And I just wanted to make sure you understood that I had this really weird erotic dream

228
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
about you.

229
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And I didn't even know that you were a couple.

230
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And it was really sexy.

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Adam, I'm curious.

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You have to tell me details immediately.

233
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Would you be in that kind of thing?

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Immediately.

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Now, did you just hear what I heard?

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Maybe the Skype connection wasn't good, but let me just replay that last little bit.

237
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Would you be into this kind of thing?

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And she says immediately.

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I mean, tell me I'm wrong.

240
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm curious.

241
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You have to tell me details immediately.

242
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Would you be in that kind of thing?

243
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Immediately.

244
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Wow.

245
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I might get upset, but I definitely want to know.

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So we're going to be in LA.

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Maybe we could all kind of hook up in Los Angeles.

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Absolutely.

249
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That'd be fantastic.

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I could tell you about my dream.

251
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes.

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I guess we can't do that now or be a whole different kind of show.

253
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh, man.

254
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm going to have to...

255
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Eric, you got to send me this recorded me because this is kind of like my show.

256
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No, I love this.

257
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This is rare.

258
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
This is...

259
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm going to use my mother calling in with something.

260
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, wait.

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm going to reveal that that's just awkward.

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No, no, no.

263
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We don't want mom getting in the way.

264
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah.

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
God.

266
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Adam, I need to go now.

267
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, man.

268
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You are so new to show business.

269
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
No, I'm not.

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You mean...

271
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You're just having me now as when the show gets interesting?

272
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
No, but didn't you get the handbook?

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's like we're all supposed to like sleep around together and stuff and do drugs.

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And that's kind of what you're supposed to do in show business.

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's just me, man.

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't know.

277
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This...

278
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This all has to go through Frankie Valley.

279
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah, go Jackie.

280
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Did you hear Jackie in the background?

281
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's the scene, man.

282
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, yeah.

283
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Look.

284
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's like we're all supposed to like sleep around together and stuff and do drugs.

285
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And that's kind of what you're supposed to do in show business.

286
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's just me, man.

287
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah.

288
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't know.

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And this all has to go through Frankie Valley first.

290
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah.

291
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I have to contact Frankie regarding everything.

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay.

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
We'll give him my regards.

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I will.

295
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
All right.

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So this show is so successful that now the San Francisco cast after they're...

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The show is going until September 30th.

298
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So new cast is coming here.

299
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And then this cast is going to Los Angeles.

300
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And so Jackie and an Eric will be there.

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And of course we've got business in Los Angeles.

302
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I hope after Friday we may have a...

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Well, you should listen to Green Room Radio.

304
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I talk about that a little bit in the show as well.

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So again, we have a Savand coming up.

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We're going to be talking about a...

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
A news item.

308
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Okurant.

309
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But first, I wasn't even going to play this.

310
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You know, Tokyo Dan called in a couple days ago, beginning of the week.

311
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Basically complaining about two things about the positive music network.

312
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And it's right that, you know,

313
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
our transaction system is weak.

314
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But of course, you know, we are giving all the money to the artist.

315
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And it was the best thing we had at the time.

316
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And we really shouldn't review that and look at...

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Look at something new there.

318
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And he also said, our search sucked.

319
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Just true.

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But we're also working on that.

321
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But it was a little bit of fence within me.

322
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Because he said, you know, we've built this on the backs of the artist.

323
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And now we have enough content.

324
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Now we're fucking them.

325
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We don't care anymore.

326
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And that's such horseshit.

327
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So, wasn't going to play his reply to that.

328
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Word not for a brand new listener who called in to respond to Tokyo Dan.

329
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So here's his second comment, which not really focuses on the money.

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And then right after that, you'll hear the, a new listener from the Bay Area,

331
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
who's, who's, who's raising with his comments.

332
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And some really smart, nice ones too.

333
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Hello, Adam.

334
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Tokyo Dan again.

335
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
How's your headphone earlobe?

336
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Well, I must got microphone mouth because I still have some things I want to say

337
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and response to your comments about my feedback on DSC587.

338
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I agree that the pod show plus music section has really been upgraded,

339
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
but for listeners.

340
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And we all know that advertising dollars chase audience.

341
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But on the other hand, what's good for listeners is probably good for the artists.

342
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Therefore, the artists are getting a lot of spins.

343
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But are these spins actually turning into dollars for the artists?

344
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
There's probably no way to tell, but I wonder.

345
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Maybe the most popular artists on the PMN are selling some CDs,

346
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
but I'm concerned for the artists that aren't so popular,

347
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
but still have some fans that like to buy the artist's music.

348
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And for a lot of non-Engly speaking artists,

349
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
the PMN is the only way for them to easily,

350
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and the keyword is easily, sell their music digitally,

351
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
to listeners in other countries.

352
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But if the artists can't easily get the money that they are owed from the PMN,

353
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
then there's no incentive for them to put their music on the PMN.

354
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This leads to my last comment.

355
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The one I made about you are not caring about the artist

356
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
since you successfully built the Pod Show Empire.

357
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Well, maybe I was harsh, and if I'm wrong, then I'm sorry.

358
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But you have to think how it appears to me.

359
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I have seen no progress on the Pod Safe Music Network for ages.

360
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Maybe there's a lot going on behind the scenes,

361
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
but it's not apparent to podcasters and artists who have been

362
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
dilling of the PMN for a long time.

363
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And in me, it seems that you haven't teased for gotten about the artist.

364
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And I can back this up.

365
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Go back and listen to DSC498.

366
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
On that show, we're comments similar to mine about the problems

367
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
involved in artists getting their money out of the PMN.

368
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The comment was made by an unhappy manager of a popular ban on the PMN.

369
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, I contacted that manager,

370
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and we sent a few emails to the Pod Show about the problem,

371
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
but nothing ever happened.

372
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So there you go.

373
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, and I'm not sure about this,

374
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
but we might have contacted PW about this also,

375
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
since that ban made his theme song,

376
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and PW has a direct route to you.

377
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Well, I want to say more,

378
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
but the microphone mouth is getting the best of me, so I'll leave it at that.

379
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Hi, my name's Pam.

380
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm a listener from the Census of Aary.

381
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I was just listening to the ESC and Pod Get In,

382
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and I'm about the PMN.

383
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So my understanding was that the Pod Show Music Network

384
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
was all about artists making music available

385
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
to Pod Cats to be able to play those music.

386
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And from my perspective,

387
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
it doesn't seem like it matters very much,

388
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
whether it's a good search interface or whether the

389
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
click-in-vide stuff works as well as it should.

390
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's a real value of the Pod Show Music Network

391
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
seemed like it's in the licensing agreement

392
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and in the ability to use Pod Cats

393
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
thing as a way to promote music.

394
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And I think it's unreasonable to think

395
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
that there's no value to an artist

396
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
just because search doesn't work as well as it could.

397
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
When it's enabling,

398
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
that doesn't seem like that's the value you're supposed to be getting

399
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
supposed to be the ability to have their music played on Pod Cats.

400
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And you know,

401
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
you want to have a better search interface

402
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
for spelling music you should go run on iTunes.

403
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And if you don't want to have Pod Cats

404
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
to play your music,

405
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
then you shouldn't be putting music on none of the PMN

406
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
of whether you want to sell it or not.

407
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So that's all I see at some thanks.

408
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I love that.

409
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Thank you so much because I could not have put it better.

410
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Tokyo, Dan, you don't be focused on the music sales.

411
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That's never what we've been about.

412
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's been about the marketing of music

413
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and exposing audiences to music.

414
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And we've been very successful

415
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
that that continued to support it.

416
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And really just the, you know,

417
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
the sales party,

418
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
we were able to do something.

419
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's not completely perfect,

420
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
but it's not our core business.

421
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And he's writing.

422
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
If you really want it to be perfect

423
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and segregated by country and easy for everyone,

424
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
then you need to do it through iTunes.

425
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So let this be the end of it.

426
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Please.

427
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So tired of this.

428
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
By the way, Eric Burger just sent me pictures of his girlfriend.

429
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Jackie.

430
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, oh, oh, man.

431
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
She's 28.

432
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
James Marino, Adam listening to the daily source code.

433
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Do you see five, eight, eight?

434
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I noticed that they,

435
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I thought I noticed that they sounded the same

436
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
so I put them next to each other.

437
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Last, I don't sound the same,

438
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
but they're phrasing rhythm are the same.

439
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
What's this about?

440
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Ah.

441
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Subject of the email.

442
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Is Alec Baldwin,

443
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Josel's boyfriend?

444
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Okay.

445
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't know who this is,

446
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
but stop fucking calling Josel, asshole.

447
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I want to say something okay.

448
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I want to leave a message for you right now.

449
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Okay, I get it.

450
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This is another link I should put on the source code.

451
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Show notes from a Sinclair much.

452
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Ah, there's a politician in,

453
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
let me just read you this.

454
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Tanya Dervo,

455
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
leading candidate for the Senate of the

456
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Nae Party and EE in Belgium.

457
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Ah, has campaign posters of her naked.

458
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's like under political party right there, boy.

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Adelia.

460
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What is that?

461
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What's their platform?

462
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's a nice platform.

463
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The official campaign involves billboards,

464
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
featuring her in all her naked glory with a very seductive look.

465
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And the text,

466
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I promise you 400,000 jobs above her.

467
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Wow.

468
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah, I bet you do, baby.

469
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay.

470
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's a time for our savant from our series of the circle of savants.

471
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Is I in the sultan of said savants?

472
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Savants?

473
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Right after I give you some important information,

474
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
because I'm working hard here.

475
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I can't have you guys crap out.

476
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I need you to call in, send in stuff,

477
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and let me just give it the phone number.

478
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:39,000
On the phone with us now,

479
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
a true savant who I've known for,

480
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I think, just about a year now.

481
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And he's a savant in many ways,

482
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
because not only is he,

483
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I believe, a yoga instructor.

484
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He is a DJ.

485
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm talking like in the club like,

486
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
you know, wheels a steel type DJ.

487
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And he is also,

488
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
but the hell are you, Mark?

489
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Are you our finance director at Podshow?

490
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm the VP of finance at Podshow.

491
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
How come, though, you didn't get a CFO title, man?

492
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Did you get jipped?

493
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
No, I don't actually.

494
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
VP is probably more purpose-wamen than CFO does too much work.

495
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's actually too little work.

496
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
At this level, CFO just sits around

497
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and tells everyone else what to do,

498
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
but at a startup company,

499
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
you actually need someone who actually does work.

500
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Mark Cierra is our VP of,

501
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
of finance, apparently.

502
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
He does basically take care of all financial matters.

503
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And I got to tell you,

504
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I've worked with a lot of financial people in my life.

505
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And you would rarely wind up in a club with them,

506
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
just hanging out,

507
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
let alone having that person be in the club,

508
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
spinning the records.

509
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Which, I just thought-

510
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What are you doing yoga?

511
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Now you are a yoga instructor, correct?

512
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yes, I've been teaching since 1996.

513
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Oh my goodness.

514
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Mark, now we got you,

515
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
we adopted you after you will recommend.

516
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I think it came through our investors.

517
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And they said, this is the hired gun.

518
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
This is the guy you want.

519
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
He's going to set your shit up straight.

520
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You've been in the valley for a while doing this type of stuff?

521
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah, actually grew up in the Bay Area.

522
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I've been working with high tech companies since

523
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
it's kind of embarrassing to admit since 1985, actually.

524
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yeah.

525
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Took the startups.

526
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And because I was at Apple for seven years,

527
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and been working doing self-employed for ten years,

528
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and I've been in Pot Show since August of 2005.

529
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So, what made you actually want to hang around Pot Show?

530
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Because you could have left.

531
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You could have gotten out while the gun was good.

532
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Well, I, as you may,

533
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I came over from referral from quite a perkins.

534
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I've been working with a couple of smaller companies.

535
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Prior to my project.

536
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Oh, and I was with self-employed for ten years.

537
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Up to that point, and just, just, you know,

538
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
talking to, you know, to run, and then, you know,

539
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
hear about the story, and the team of investors,

540
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and kind of what Pot Show was doing at the time,

541
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and the future, I remember this,

542
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
over a year and a half ago, just sounded really intriguing to me,

543
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and, like, the team definitely liked the space at the end,

544
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and, like, entertainment and media,

545
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and thought it would be crazy enough for me to join.

546
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, we are very happy that you, that you did join,

547
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and we're glad that you're still hanging in there.

548
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I know you're going to leave us one day eventually.

549
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But, fuck, I'm going to go back to,

550
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
what are you doing?

551
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Playing hoops later on today?

552
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That's right.

553
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Hoops.

554
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Correct.

555
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So, what's really, you know,

556
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
why Mark is, is in the circle of the sabons,

557
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
is, you know, I really enjoy talking to him at the office

558
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
about all kinds of stuff, and, you know,

559
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
the topics are very quite a bit,

560
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
but when it comes to finance, Mark really knows his shit,

561
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
and he has the added advantage of having worked at Apple.

562
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So, there's this big new story,

563
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
and all I read in the press and online,

564
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
everything I see on television is, you know,

565
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
evil options back dating, you know,

566
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
kind of this meme of bad corporate governance,

567
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
you know, and interestingly enough,

568
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
on the same day that Apple announces,

569
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
it doubled their profits to $770 million for the past quarter.

570
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And the one thing that I don't read anymore

571
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
is what an option is.

572
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You know, everyone's talking about this.

573
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I mean, you can turn on the local,

574
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
the local, the local, the K, whatever news,

575
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and, oh, options.

576
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And you have just anyone understand what an option is?

577
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I mean, Mark, could you give us a synopsis,

578
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
just so the Charlie listeners who were out there,

579
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
who would like to maybe get a refresher course,

580
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
just know what this is about and this option thing?

581
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah, I see if I can break it down here.

582
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So, basically an option is the right to buy

583
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
some shares at a certain pre-determined price.

584
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And the idea of being that you lock in the purchase price

585
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
of that at a later date or the same date,

586
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
which you can have definitely happened,

587
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
you can, you will make money on what's called the spread.

588
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So, if you were to be able to purchase the shares,

589
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
it's a 10-dollar share,

590
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and either that day or months later or years later,

591
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
it's at the current stock price of how the option is trading,

592
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
it's at 30 or 40 or 50 dollars,

593
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
then you'd make the difference as profit.

594
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So, I think there's many shares as you own.

595
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
In the dot com days,

596
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
which actually the story is from, I think,

597
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
2000, 2001, options were used as an incentive

598
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
because you pretty much knew any company that started off,

599
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
that was public, that went public even better.

600
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
The share price would go up,

601
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and if you could lock yourself in, as you said,

602
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
then you would stand to make a nice amount of money.

603
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
In fact, that's where a lot of the dot com millionaires came from.

604
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Was this always used as an incentive,

605
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
or did options actually stem from something else

606
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
in the past before the dot com hype of the turn of the century?

607
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Absolutely.

608
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So, options, I mean, when I worked at Apple,

609
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
this was pre, it was pre, you know, dot com maybe.

610
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
This was pre wood when you worked at Apple, man.

611
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah.

612
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It was Apple's 89 to 96, because it definitely was options,

613
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
but it was nowhere near the menu,

614
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
because Apple was posted,

615
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
so there was no, you weren't going to be getting options at,

616
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
like, five cents a share and being able to sell them,

617
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and like, like, $200 a share later on.

618
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
But, clearly, you know,

619
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
even as a public treated company,

620
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
there's still lots of fluctuation,

621
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and still way for executives to make, you know,

622
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
to paying him any shares, your options, you got,

623
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
you mean, hundreds of thousands, or potentially millions of dollars,

624
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
things went the right way, which they did for a lot of people.

625
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But it was always an incentive-based instrument, clearly.

626
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Absolutely. Yes, I was incentive.

627
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Okay. So, what, what actually happened here,

628
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and what, what is the story about?

629
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Because you, you, there's one thing,

630
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and so I understand that you can say,

631
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
all right, we're going to, I guess,

632
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
grant you set amount of options at a strike pie,

633
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
so if, if we did that today, I would say,

634
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
okay, you're going to get some options at today's strike price.

635
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We're not a publicly traded company,

636
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm kind of, some number that's on that,

637
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and then you have the right to actually buy those,

638
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and get the spread later on.

639
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Take me back to those days of, of the dot com hype,

640
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
and, you know, when options were basically the currency that,

641
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
companies were using to bring in, quote,

642
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
smart people, or, that's another word for high price people,

643
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
that really didn't cost all that much in it.

644
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Oh, definitely. Yeah, definitely not.

645
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So, so back in, back in,

646
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
this time in terms of the, the startup company is basically the option

647
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
to be priced, basically any, you know,

648
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
10, basically 10 percent of whatever the,

649
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
the A or B or whatever they most current round

650
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
does it basically price the up to 10 percent,

651
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
you know, basically this 10 percent of that,

652
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and obviously there was a lot of money to,

653
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
made later on when company would get acquired

654
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
or go public at a much higher price,

655
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
and whatever the A or B round was,

656
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
you know, so right away, I mean,

657
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
even if it didn't even use the soldier's shares at the,

658
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
at the round price,

659
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
you didn't make 90 percent profit just on that formula.

660
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So what happened here? What, so there's the X CFO,

661
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I guess Fred Anderson,

662
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
it was investigated by the SEC,

663
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and he says, well,

664
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
these options were back dated.

665
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Just explain the back dating to me for a second.

666
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah, so basically on back dating,

667
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
is what you're doing here in this scenario,

668
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
is you're saying,

669
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
we're going to set the price at a date,

670
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
a date further back from when the work,

671
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
you know, when it should have been based,

672
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and the idea being that the price was a lower on,

673
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
on an earlier date,

674
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and therefore there was more money to be made on the spread.

675
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So it's basically what it refers to,

676
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
is taking the option price date further back,

677
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
and then it should have been.

678
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So without,

679
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
without incriminating myself,

680
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm pretty sure that,

681
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
because Ron and I ran a public company

682
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
back in the day,

683
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
squeaky clean, I might add,

684
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
but I certainly can remember conversations

685
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
where we would say, oh, look,

686
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
now our stock price really didn't do much for two and a half years,

687
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
so it was all kind of a mood point anyway.

688
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
In fact, our stock price,

689
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
we came out of went from $7.00 in a quarter

690
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
down to three.

691
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I was very, very successful IPO,

692
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
but we did turn the company around

693
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and I think when we sold it,

694
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
the stock price was in the 50s.

695
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But the idea of, you know,

696
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
well, you know, we talked today,

697
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
but you know what,

698
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
we'll back date these options to the beginning of the month,

699
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
or something like that,

700
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
which may have,

701
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I don't know if we actually looking at the stock price chart

702
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
at the time,

703
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
maybe I doubt it,

704
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
it was all kind of underwater for everybody anyway.

705
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But it seemed like it was a pretty common practice,

706
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
where there are no rules against it.

707
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Well,

708
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I just wasn't as closely followed by,

709
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
you know, the, the SEC, I think,

710
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and I think,

711
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
you know, I was,

712
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
since kind of the,

713
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
the surveillance,

714
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
obsolete kind of stuff.

715
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It came result of, you know,

716
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
all the corporate scandals of the,

717
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
like say,

718
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Andrew, I'm for example.

719
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah, so all the stuff is being much more close to monitor.

720
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I mean,

721
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
suppose there was monitoring,

722
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and it was relatively loose,

723
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
and they really try to clamp down

724
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
on some of these kind of practices,

725
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
where they just basically are,

726
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
you know,

727
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
giving much more,

728
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
you know,

729
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
income to these executives,

730
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
not doing any more work.

731
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But, but Mark,

732
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
it's not just executives.

733
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It's also,

734
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
it's employees, right?

735
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Absolutely, but it won't work.

736
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's everybody,

737
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
but the thing that gets the attention,

738
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
of course,

739
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
is the executives.

740
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I mean,

741
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
that's the one that really pops out.

742
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah,

743
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
agreed.

744
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It is everybody,

745
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
but the one who makes out the most,

746
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the guys,

747
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
the one that gets the publicity is,

748
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
is it going to have,

749
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
like,

750
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
when we're working here,

751
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and we're more money at stake.

752
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Okay,

753
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
so that's not,

754
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
now you mentioned Enron,

755
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
was stock option back dating,

756
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
did that contribute to the Enron collapse,

757
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
or,

758
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
to me,

759
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
this really has no other effect,

760
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
than that shareholders may get pissed off,

761
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
because,

762
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
well,

763
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
they're greedy,

764
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
it just has greedy,

765
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
everybody else, I guess.

766
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Right,

767
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
because Enron was not about back dating,

768
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
back dating,

769
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
it was,

770
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
the one that seems to be getting the most attention,

771
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
as you mentioned,

772
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
it was really this,

773
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
this current case with,

774
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
with Steve Jobs and Apple.

775
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You worked for Fred Anderson,

776
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
the CFO,

777
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
who was accusing,

778
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
or I don't know if it's,

779
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
it really is an accusation,

780
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
but what he basically,

781
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
an unfair phrasing said is,

782
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
look,

783
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Steve Jobs knew about the back dating,

784
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
it happened,

785
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
it wasn't,

786
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Steve Jobs didn't make any money off of it himself,

787
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
which I believe,

788
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm sure he did it for however,

789
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
the new hires were,

790
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
or whatever,

791
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
you know,

792
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
they needed an option pool,

793
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
they needed to make it attractive,

794
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
it could have been any number of,

795
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
a factors like that.

796
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
What are the implications,

797
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
what does it say about Fred Anderson,

798
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
first of all,

799
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
maybe you can go to some background on him,

800
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and,

801
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and what does this mean do you think for jobs?

802
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Well, I,

803
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I want to be real clear about,

804
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I,

805
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I've worked for Fred for about his very first,

806
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
couple months there at Apple,

807
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
because I,

808
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I was there,

809
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I left in 1966,

810
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and he was coming on,

811
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
in fact,

812
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I was actually one of the first people

813
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
they ever met at Apple,

814
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
because of the time we were raising

815
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
a convertible debt,

816
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
funding of $650 million,

817
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
and that came in,

818
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
he came in with the CFO,

819
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
around the same time,

820
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
the new CFO at the time.

821
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Who was that,

822
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Emilio?

823
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That was Gilimilio,

824
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and,

825
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
and the contingency of the,

826
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
the investment community,

827
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
issuing the $650 million

828
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
that was the new management team,

829
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
being Gilimilio,

830
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and Fred Anderson.

831
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So let's just say,

832
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
by the way,

833
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
this all happened just around,

834
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
that,

835
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
you know,

836
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
so Steve Jobs came back and saved the company,

837
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
it sounds like they were pretty

838
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
dire straits in 1996.

839
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Very dire straits.

840
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's basically,

841
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
uh,

842
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Gilimilio has been very well documented

843
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
in some of the,

844
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
you know,

845
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
local high tech articles,

846
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
uh,

847
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
70% down in the S&D.

848
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Jobs came in.

849
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm going to say,

850
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
97-98-time chairman

851
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
as you mentioned,

852
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
just totally turn it around,

853
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
the stock price more.

854
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I mean,

855
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
more else,

856
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
afternoon.

857
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I mean,

858
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
just like pretty much every level.

859
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And obviously,

860
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
as a huge impact,

861
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,240
financially,

862
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,000
market capitalization,

863
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
employees,

864
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and obviously the iPod came later on,

865
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
and that's been its own kind of,

866
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
massive hit and its own right.

867
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But,

868
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
.

869
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So what,

870
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
what was right?

871
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,440
department and on sent a road really nice guy just just

872
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,400
been a brief pretty pretty pretty humble duty came over from i believe a

873
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
adp at the time

874
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,200
uh... just yeah we just we just sat in his living room and

875
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,080
kind of went through some of the stuff you know this is a four cast

876
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,360
just in the guys living room talking about half a billion dollars you know

877
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,280
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you're in the lotus position right

878
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,240
spin in some uh... DJ chiesto tunes

879
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,160
exactly exactly yeah well at that time yeah i was just starting to do you get that time

880
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,160
actually so uh... yeah so just look really really nice guy and had a lot of

881
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,160
credibility coming into company and seem to can't keep his uh... and knows about the

882
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,960
fray and during during his whole time they're actually pretty pretty

883
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,640
solid reputation through the industry and i believe he's now with uh... the

884
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,240
elevation partners

885
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,760
the cc from jk believe it's well that's uh... you choose uh... you too with

886
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,280
bono exactly so uh... you know mark you know me well enough by now we found out

887
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,600
a bit and whenever a uh... multi billionaires and dire straits i love to come to

888
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,040
his rescue into his defense uh...

889
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,680
it did steve jobs do something really illegal in your opinion

890
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,360
well that's a talk about not being that close to the nation and it's hard to

891
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,120
say i mean

892
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,320
so i i guess the question is how much did you know when did you know it and uh...

893
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,880
or you know how to stuff that we can go straight to that because essentially

894
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,800
what front Anderson said if i understand correctly is steve jobs new about it

895
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,720
and you proved the uh... the back dating of the uh... this is like it seems to me

896
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,400
like Anderson did a big

897
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,640
either a cover your ass or perhaps a saviour ass deal with the cc by implicating steve

898
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,320
jobs that's what i'm getting from the media is that really what this is

899
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,400
if that's the case and yet if this uh... is this what is what is what is

900
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,320
fray is saying is true then uh... and clearly uh... steve something he's

901
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,920
going to be a little bit of trouble

902
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
and it may be even a lot of trouble

903
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
doesn't know that so

904
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,880
quantify that what kind of trouble

905
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,320
uh... basically knowledge uh... what kind of like maybe i kind of

906
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,600
market steward trouble right where he'd got a new something was going on and uh...

907
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:07,440
was was was complicit with uh... unknown uh... price that wasn't uh... that's

908
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,440
it shouldn't have been and when it had was it anyway we have maybe i don't

909
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,040
maybe some sort of you know

910
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,320
kind of equivalent of the collection inside of information thing where he might be

911
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,520
like like trouble like might be a pretty big sign for example

912
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,320
maybe so well that's interesting i'm glad you brought up martha steward because boy what

913
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,280
of what uh...

914
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,240
how that would be very interesting if uh... if what jobs is implicated of

915
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,760
you know got him in a lot of trouble but he didn't have to go to jail he could

916
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,640
buy it off whereas martha steward could have certainly paid

917
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,960
paid off any fine equal to the crime and she actually you know went to the big house

918
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,680
she actually because but on a pop culture no initially enough actually

919
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,800
part of the great thing ever happened i mean that much credibility now she has

920
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,400
uh... with her minions

921
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,600
i mean she's got a whole new audience people because she found she's got like

922
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,440
street cred or something she was not just doing doylies

923
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,280
she was doing doylies and she was doing doylies on the slamer baby yeah

924
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,560
yeah and a way that you know for more than you know

925
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,480
came to the side bigger and more i mean it's an interesting enough right because he would

926
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,800
i could have been worse than ever but uh... as a pop culture thing it's

927
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,920
i think it's made her more intimate more famous and i don't know

928
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,640
but i don't know i i personally kind of think it's cool for

929
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,720
it's a weird way she's not a very happy person so

930
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,160
she's not a happy no she's not this is just a general she's got a few

931
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,840
husband along the way we had we had an office in the same building in New York

932
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,360
years ago not a happy person but she can turn it on when i want to keep you

933
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,440
life so she can't oh yeah she's a professional so

934
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,840
i can't finish it so it jobs could be in the in real trouble but this is where it

935
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,920
gets interesting because uh... shareholders

936
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,520
who are the ones that are that the only ones i think in this whole game who can be

937
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,480
really pissed off it's not like this affected

938
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,920
the quality of the products in fact it probably made the products better because

939
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,360
people were incentivize and they were working their ass off to get the stock price up

940
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,920
and make the company perform better et cetera um i'm sure that uh... although

941
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,680
i don't have any documentation back at up i'm sure that this didn't only go to

942
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,480
executives but it probably there was an option pool

943
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,160
and it must have gone to other people as well who also of course you

944
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,600
lead lead the company um if they were to remove Steve jobs

945
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,480
or hurt him in some way that he couldn't perform his CEO duties for apple

946
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,840
that could actually have the adverse effect and it could really fuck up the company

947
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,320
because you know here's a company that just doubled their

948
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,240
they're profit in a quarter and this ipod as you mentioned is is you know the whole

949
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,040
just they're on fire right now so is this

950
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,880
you know is it a good thing for having worked there for seven years

951
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,640
yeah having worked there for seven years i mean i was there very uh... michael spinner

952
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,640
millio john scoli all these big name none of them could run that place none of them

953
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,400
i think during the ten year of all the three folks they destroyed more shareholder value

954
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,240
then uh... and the jobs with the with the fucking options right

955
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,440
incredible yeah so yeah so he's making out like a black abandon but at the same time

956
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,760
so is everything first is invested in out of the years during the time when he was the

957
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,160
CEO before he left back in the uh... the real eighties or since he's been there since

958
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,640
the late nineties very interestingly enough

959
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,480
so what do you think what's going to happen what's going to boil down to

960
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,440
i think he's just going to get a new i think he's just going to borrow part of the

961
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,000
body in his way he's going to display patience small uh... some small being relative

962
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,760
because the guy is by a multi-multi doing her but he'll pay a fine and get his way out of it

963
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,480
that's kind of my personal opinion so he should do a meacolpa and he should say okay look uh...

964
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,680
different times fucked up uh... and then well uh... here's fifty million dollars i and i think

965
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,520
it would be between fifty and two hundred and fifty million probably somewhere in there

966
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,040
and it's enough it's by not a big of a deal for him

967
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,000
it's not a scene

968
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
it's just wrong uh... it's just gave me the willy

969
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
right that you're on and part of it's part of it makes America great

970
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,320
so so the question is if uh... if you were to find yourself in uh... in uh... in uh...

971
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,240
anderson's position and uh... and run and i said look it's okay just back

972
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,360
date these things what would you do

973
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,040

And help it, it's such a happy song Makes me feel good

1021
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
Fire aims, let me know

1022
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,480
We'll have to save music, not work

1023
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,480
Of course, the link to that fine musical band

1024
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,480
In the show, no, it's a daily source code dot com

1025
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,480
Just one quick thing before we end the show going back to Tokyo Band and Dan who was basically

1026
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,480
Telling us how much we suck and that there may be stuff going on behind the scenes

1027
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,480
But it's not apparent to artists according to Tokyo Dan

1028
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,480
Yeah, sure do need you help

1029
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,480
Well, you know, we haven't been sitting still entirely that Tokyo Dan if you

1030
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,480
Tenant over to curry dot com, you can see in one of the blog posts

1031
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,480
All the ideas and the war room and all the stuff that's been going on

1032
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,480
We've been working on helping ourselves suck less and we've got some special stuff coming up

1033
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,480
In the next couple of weeks that you can really help us out

1034
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,480
With the mission of sucking less

1035
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,480
That's it, I got to get out of here. I'll talk to you guys tomorrow

1036
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,480
It'll be full bar Friday. I'm thinking no savant, but let's just rock it out with some music

1037
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,480
Just a full show of music

1038
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,480
So I need your suggestions and let's really let's make it flow

1039
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,480
Let's have a great show that you're going to save on your iPod or whatever the hell you use

1040
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,480
And you're going to just just to feel happy you're going to pull that episode up again

1041
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,480
