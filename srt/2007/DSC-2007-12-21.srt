1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Make a statement with Sony stereo ear buds, sleek metal housings that reduce vibration

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,280
delivering killer sound from a tiny package, by yours at Sony.com-slashheadphones, Sony

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,400
ear buds with style meets sound.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,400
Delta Sierra Charney 703, $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, to the next

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:50,400
generation rating content in my ears.

6
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:41,360
It's hard to believe that it's my first time, to my mind, on the one hand it's

7
00:01:41,360 --> 00:02:11,360
my life together, and so far, so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far,

8
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:41,360
and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far, and so far,

9
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,360
I can't change, I can't change, I can't believe

10
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,360
And they got the memory of the love that died

11
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,360
It's died, I can't believe it's your fault

12
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,360
It's died, I can't believe it's your fault

13
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:24,360
It's died, I can't believe it's your fault

14
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,360
It's died, I can't believe it's your fault

15
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,180
And we're thankful for everything

16
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,820
Of a nice little boy

17
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,960
That changed

18
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,080
But dreams can biteÄ™dzie

19
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,360
With a equal tenth ring

20
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,620
It's an old lie that you don't wanna bite

21
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:54,980
I'm changed

22
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,460
And the endreaction pops

23
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,220
Many of you are open up to remember

24
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:11,660
I was 25 years ago, the height of the Cold War ultra-vots just blew us away with dancing

25
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:18,580
with tears in my eyes and I got to tell you a bit of a day to prove and not a very

26
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,580
good one.

27
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,740
In fact, those guys were on my very first TV show, I think.

28
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,420
I think it was them and derand Iran and for some reason I'm thinking of really Nelson

29
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,860
that's exactly right.

30
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:40,220
Oh man, I gotta tell you, my head hurts, not from work, not from the weather, not from

31
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:48,820
television, but from a book, this book that John Seedivore I gave to me or turned

32
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,220
me on to Confessions of an Economic Hitman, EHM for short, has just really

33
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,220
blown my mind.

34
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:02,140
I'm now I'm finally seeing the really, really, really big picture, which is, I shut

35
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:07,980
or even to say that it's bigger than the 9-11, it's bigger than the war in Iraq, it's

36
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,820
much, much larger and all of the pieces of this puzzle that I've been putting together

37
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,900
over the course of, gosh, what has it been now?

38
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,580
Several months, they're finally starting to fall into place.

39
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,380
I don't know if I can articulate it all just yet because it's so simple that it's really

40
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,380
hard to understand.

41
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,860
Does that make any sense?

42
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,860
So some of today's football will be sprinkled with that here and there and I've been

43
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,500
finding just amazing things as I'm going through today's chapter in the soundtrack to my

44
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
life.

45
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,660
This is from the Potset Music Network, from a guy named Colin Muchler and he puts up Spoken

46
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,820
Word, check this out.

47
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,860
The markets are starting to question themselves, the bloggers exposing our blisters, just

48
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,260
the everyday words of everyday people are shifting the tone of the televised speeches, and

49
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,860
the artists are starting to question themselves and the poets are speaking like leaders,

50
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,860
and the everyday choices of everyday people are facing the storms and curing diseases.

51
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,900
So go Skype and iPod, pre-mix some wages, but don't forget to make a version for the

52
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:22,420
sages because when we look beyond our next meal, our next post, we are responsible for

53
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:29,900
our everyday votes, the ones we use to buy our shoes, to buy our homes, to buy our tunes.

54
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,420
Here's some talking about our dollars, our euros, our pesos, our yen, because what

55
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,620
of the next 20 years are happening again?

56
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:48,580
If we've already arrived, it's 2025, and the doomsday duos, the war and peace heroes,

57
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:56,740
haven't avoided the global cooling, the flu-grown zeros, and the forgotten people.

58
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,380
Is the markets are starting to question themselves, and the bloggers exposing our blisters?

59
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:08,340
Is the everyday words of everyday people are shifting the tone of the televised speeches,

60
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,620
and the artists are starting to question themselves, and the poets are speaking like leaders,

61
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,460
and the everyday choices of everyday people are facing the storms and curing diseases.

62
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,300
Oh yeah, deep shit.

63
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,300
And as I'm thinking about that, I'm thinking, where are all the protests songs?

64
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:35,140
I can go to any search engine online and I can find tons of protests songs from previous

65
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
wars.

66
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,260
Where are they for this one?

67
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,140
Where are the true protests songs?

68
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,660
And I'm looking for the dealings.

69
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,020
I'm looking for the spring steins.

70
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,060
I'm looking for some really, really grabbing shit.

71
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,660
And it's just not that easy to find.

72
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:58,180
Our commercial mainstream music mechanism, the engine is just pumping out mindless crap.

73
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,620
I think we need something with some lyrics here or there.

74
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,260
Well, here's something maybe that'll jog your memory.

75
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,500
It's the time it ends.

76
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,300
Are you ready to be stumps?

77
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,820
I'm watching the video version, it's Yann and his studio again.

78
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,700
Hey, Yann, hey Adam, this is a hate this number 101.

79
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,100
I'm going to start right away with intro number one.

80
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,660
I'm running out of time.

81
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,660
Ah crap.

82
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,460
Number two.

83
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,620
All right, let's change.

84
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,420
Um, well, it was a name of the song.

85
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,460
You want me, don't you?

86
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,860
It's definitely changed.

87
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,660
I know that for sure.

88
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,500
Is that's one from the decibel radio there?

89
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,580
And this week's final one is intro number three.

90
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,380
Oh, please.

91
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,660
Emergency.

92
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,020
Paging Dr. Beats.

93
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,260
That'll be glorious stuff on the Miami Sound Machine.

94
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,420
But what was that first one?

95
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,140
I know it.

96
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,980
Ah.

97
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,500
And times up in these ideas.

98
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,660
Uh, and some number one is from 1988.

99
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,180
Wait, wait, wait.

100
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,300
Three.

101
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,000
Up.

102
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,020
Uh, nice.

103
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,380
Yann has the album covers now in the video version.

104
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,100
Nice production.

105
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:42,100
Which wet wetter's answer number one, and this is answer number two, from 1985.

106
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,100
There's a change. This is change. Yeah, let's go together.

107
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,100
One here, one here, one here.

108
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Yeah, I remember the album cover, very well young, looking at it now.

109
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Not a real single, I'm no.

110
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Change is answer number two.

111
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,100
Emergency, aging, Dr. Beat.

112
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,100
And this is answer number three, from 1984.

113
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
The Miami Sound Machine, this is Dr. Beat.

114
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:44,100
It's answer number three, and hit test number one, oh, one.

115
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
So, Adam, how did you do?

116
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
One and a half stars.

117
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,100
The answers to this hit test, and also the links to iTunes, who can buy these tracks online,

118
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,100
are to be found at hittest.botshow.com.

119
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
Thanks for playing, Adam.

120
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Thank you for listening.

121
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Next week, I'll be back for hit this number one or two.

122
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
So, until then, take care, and bye-bye.

123
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Yeah, it's really weird, young.

124
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,100
Instead of sending me an MP3, young sent me an MP4, which is the video version.

125
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,100
He's got multi camera set up now. He's got title.

126
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,100
He's got lower thirds. He's got album covers flying through him.

127
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,100
It's a whole production. It's really, really nice.

128
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
But young, it's really disturbing.

129
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,100
Please, just send me the MP3 because it's hard to concentrate in your wall of sound

130
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
when I'm looking at the video.

131
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,100
And by the way, Podshow, I dropped the C there for some reason you had a,

132
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:53,100
you had POD, SCHOW.com, like Pod School, only with a W.

133
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Oh, yes.

134
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Funky tunes, man.

135
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,100
I hadn't heard a number of those in a long, long time.

136
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Hey, man. It's Nick from the Bay.

137
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,100
So, have you heard about, I just heard this morning,

138
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
there's a new study done by the Associated Press,

139
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:16,100
and they said that the most disliked of all federal government

140
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,100
organizations is the TSA.

141
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Yeah.

142
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,100
People hated even more than the IRS.

143
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
That's pretty impressive.

144
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
So, yeah, you got some followers out there.

145
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,100
I just thought that you'd be interested in that little fact toy.

146
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
No, yeah, I'm curious.

147
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
No, man.

148
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Back at your normal.

149
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,100
You know, the last night I was looking,

150
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,100
I was doing a little bit of research looking into the clear program,

151
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,100
which is this program, which is set up or approved,

152
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
I should say, by the TSA.

153
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,100
It's a commercial company in Virginia, low on behold,

154
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
who run this program.

155
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
And I figured I just look into it.

156
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,100
You know, see, see what it was all about.

157
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,100
And so, I learned a little bit of information about the TSA as well.

158
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Yes, that I compared them to Burger Flippers.

159
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
First of all, this is actually quite interesting.

160
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,100
And I'm thinking, am I bringing it up on Noah Genda?

161
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,100
That's the show I do with John C.

162
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,100
We're at once a week at NoahGenda.podshow.com.

163
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Stephen Brill, and this may ring a bell to some people.

164
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
I'm pretty sure that John is going to know,

165
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,100
he'll know of him for sure, and he may even have some good dirt on the guy.

166
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:34,100
At one point, I think I first heard about him when he had Brill's content,

167
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:40,100
which was like a monthly magazine about the media industry.

168
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,100
And this was a late, actually I'm looking at the page now.

169
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
It went belly up in 2001.

170
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,100
So he started clear.

171
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,100
If you can, actually he started a company called Hold on.

172
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,100
The company is called Verified Identity Pass.

173
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,100
And apparently he came up with this genius idea

174
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,100
to basically come up with a national ID card.

175
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,100
When he was visiting Attorney General John Ascroff,

176
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
all they asked him for was a driver's license.

177
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,100
And he felt that, you know, that was bad security.

178
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,100
So he came up with, let's see,

179
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,100
his blueprint for was he calling it the National Identification Card.

180
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,100
That's some other tidbits in here.

181
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,100
But anyway, so to this guy created this company,

182
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,100
and then the TSA, and they have a whole section on this,

183
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,100
they awarded Verified Identity Pass

184
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,100
as a part of the, or is it?

185
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,100
The Register Traveler Program,

186
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,100
they allowed them to operate in a number of airports.

187
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
I guess it's still, it may still be on trial.

188
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,100
They've had other companies doing this,

189
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:02,100
but it seems like these guys are winning territory.

190
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,100
So I just thought that was kind of interesting.

191
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,100
More interesting, though, when I looked around,

192
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,100
and I found out what the requirements are

193
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
to become a TSA screener.

194
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
And all these links, of course,

195
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
will be in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

196
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,100
So I went to the TSA website, TSA careers,

197
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,100
and I'm going to write now.

198
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,100
I'm going to pull up the available position

199
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,100
for security officer, particularly screening officer,

200
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,100
hold on.

201
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
That's all there seems to be available.

202
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Let's see, there's a couple of states.

203
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,100
How about California San Jose?

204
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
Full time?

205
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
All right.

206
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,100
And air transportation security officer,

207
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,100
parentheses, screener.

208
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
This is also known as a TSO.

209
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,100
So what you'll expect it to be able to perform,

210
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
our duty, such as communicate with the public,

211
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
giving directions and responding to increase

212
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
an professional and courteous manner.

213
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Right.

214
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Maintained focus and awareness with

215
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,100
an environment containing numerous distractions,

216
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,100
people and noise, stand and remain standing

217
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,100
for periods up to four hours without sitting.

218
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,100
How many of those guys you see standing around for four hours?

219
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Repeatedly lift and carry an object weighing up to 70 pounds.

220
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Work within a stressful environment,

221
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
which includes noise from alarms, machinery,

222
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
and people's distraction, time pressure,

223
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
disruptive and angry passengers,

224
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,100
and the requirement to identify and locate potentially

225
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
life-threatening devices and devices intended

226
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
on creating massive destruction.

227
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Hey, devices of weapons of mass destruction.

228
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
And also you need to make effective decisions

229
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,100
in both crisis and routine situations.

230
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,100
And so that's seen pretty, I guess,

231
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
pretty normal to me.

232
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,100
But then there was the actual requirements,

233
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,100
which is kind of this, by the way,

234
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,100
is a $23,000-dollar-year job.

235
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,100
This is a non-critical sensitive,

236
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,100
national security position that requires you

237
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
to be fingerprinted photograph

238
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
and complete appropriate security paperwork,

239
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
including an SF86.

240
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,100
A non-critical sensitive,

241
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
national security position.

242
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,100
Well, I'm so sorry.

243
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,100
You know, this is really honking me off.

244
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Why don't we have highly skilled,

245
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:29,100
very professional experts doing this?

246
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,100
You know, in fact, qualifications,

247
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
you must be a US citizen or US national

248
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,100
and you must have a high school diploma,

249
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
a GED or equivalent or,

250
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
or, if you don't have a high school diploma

251
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
or a GED equivalency,

252
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,100
at least one year of full-time work experience

253
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
insecurity work, which means all those people

254
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
who were doing it before 9-11 have come back

255
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,100
and are just back in their same jobs.

256
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,100
If you've done at least one year full-time aviation

257
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,100
screener work or X-ray technician work,

258
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,100
boy.

259
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Your tax dollars at work.

260
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,100
It's only like five or six billion a year

261
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
we spend on it.

262
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
And listen to this next call,

263
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,100
how incredibly effective these burger flippers are.

264
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,100
By the way, nothing against burger flippers.

265
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,100
You know, Adam, Chris, I'm living down.

266
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,100
So I could give you my little incident with coma and security.

267
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,100
I had the TFA open up my bag.

268
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
And I always take my bags in a situation

269
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,100
that I don't know if somebody opened them.

270
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,100
That's preventive load,

271
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,100
and just so I can tell if they were open.

272
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,100
But, um, they,

273
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
I flew out the Arizona for rocket launch

274
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
and they check my bags.

275
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,100
Wait a minute.

276
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Okay. This is very important.

277
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,100
He flew out to Arizona for rocket launch.

278
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
Hold on.

279
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Let me see what this is.

280
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
Rocket launch.

281
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Arizona.

282
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
Google with me, people.

283
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Uh, rocket launch.

284
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Hmm.

285
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Doesn't really.

286
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
Hmm.

287
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,100
Okay.

288
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,100
I guess it's like a burning man for rocket enthusiasts or something like that.

289
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Oh, interesting.

290
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,100
They did not open or check the piece of luggage.

291
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Failed with rockets.

292
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
They opened the luggage.

293
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,100
It's a little bit closed.

294
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,100
It's a little bit closed.

295
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,100
And right last top, but they did not open the hard gel suitcase full of rockets.

296
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
No rock loaders, of course.

297
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,100
You know that your actual prison time is there.

298
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,100
Rocket motor or everybody's.

299
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,100
But the piece was full of rockets.

300
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
They opened that one either way.

301
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
They're out.

302
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
But anyway, I get to know a tell room.

303
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
Reaching to my bag and like, like,

304
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
I'll help.

305
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
I'll free warm in here.

306
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,100
I stick my hand.

307
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
The laptop, it burned my hand.

308
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,100
It actually gave me a blister.

309
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,100
The sums of big is it turned on my laptop

310
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,100
and left it on.

311
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
I guess the morons could figure out how to turn the thing off.

312
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,100
So they just left it on and stuff the back of the case.

313
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,100
I hate that.

314
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,100
How it gets in die?

315
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,100
I don't know.

316
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,100
I mean, it's a, it's a, it's a no grade laptop.

317
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
It's the one you can leave out the rain and stuff.

318
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
You can drop it on current creative own effect as well.

319
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
I try to excuse.

320
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,100
So from now on, when I travel, I do not leave batteries in anything inside the case.

321
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,100
All my batteries go in my case.

322
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Or rockets.

323
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,100
I don't leave batteries inside the laptop.

324
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Any more for that reason alone.

325
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Just so they can't fry my laptops.

326
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,100
Thankfully, it was okay.

327
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,100
But yeah, what are you going to do?

328
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
I just find that ironic that they, you know,

329
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
they check the bag with the laptop.

330
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,100
They didn't check the bag full of little missiles.

331
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,100
And a new phrase for you.

332
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,100
Go fuck the running corpse of Homeland Security.

333
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
And your mouth will do bushware at it too.

334
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Yeah, right.

335
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Right.

336
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
I'm a brother.

337
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
That's great.

338
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,100
He called in later with another comment about the electric car, which I'm going to play

339
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
free later on.

340
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,100
I looked it up.

341
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,100
It's, I think it's rocketry planet.com.

342
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,100
Yeah, I used to be in model rockets.

343
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
I used to be pretty cool.

344
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,100
Obviously, you can't take the actual motors, the actual.

345
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
What is that?

346
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
Solid, solid fuel.

347
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
Cartridges.

348
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,100
Or however, these looks like some serious rockets.

349
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,100
But yeah, I have to agree when there's a suitcase full of missiles.

350
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,100
With or without engines, I think it's pretty important.

351
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,100
That shows up somewhere.

352
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Go as a study that came out today.

353
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,100
So when email me that some hard,

354
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Harvard students found out that, well,

355
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,100
as we all kind of know, that the TSA is, you know,

356
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
really senseless.

357
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,100
And it's not really making us any more secure.

358
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,100
And in the TSA, replied by saying,

359
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,100
look, we're ready for any open and honest debate about this.

360
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,100
Okay.

361
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
How do you let rockets go through?

362
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,100
Dicks.

363
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
Man.

364
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,100
And I kid just because I can.

365
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,100
But again, this is not the, this is not the real problem.

366
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,100
These are just little, little tiny pieces of the machine,

367
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,100
which is so huge and which has been around for 50 years, five decades.

368
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,100
And I have to tell you, I believe that at least some members of my family

369
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
have been involved in this huge machine,

370
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,100
which involves humanitarian aid as a cover.

371
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:07,100
And the IMF and the World Bank and it does indeed revolve around huge companies,

372
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,100
basically stealing money.

373
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,100
They're not even stealing it, taking it legally.

374
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,100
It's even worse, being printed without license

375
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
by the Federal Reserve, by the Treasury.

376
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,100
We're in deep shit about this.

377
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,100
And somehow I've got to formulate the real story.

378
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,100
But in the meantime, please go read,

379
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,100
or listen to the audio book, Confessions of an economic hitman.

380
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,100
I mean, through this guy I've gotten to,

381
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,100
that's John Perkins, I've gotten to, who's this other guy?

382
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
I'm on a second.

383
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,100
He's a BBC, a BBC journalist.

384
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100
What's his name?

385
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Greg Palist.

386
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Oh, man.

387
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100
You should Google him.

388
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,100
Look at a couple of videos that he's got online.

389
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,100
Once you really see it, once you really see what's going on,

390
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,100
it becomes so aware.

391
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
It's just an awakening for me.

392
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Okay, now I get it, now I see how it works.

393
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
And it's actually, once you can understand

394
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,100
how everything fits together, and that it's not one guy

395
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
or some conspiracy of people,

396
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,100
but really a machine that has been built up

397
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,100
and has almost has perpetual motion,

398
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,100
which, of course, it doesn't really look at all the failures

399
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,100
we're seeing now with our currencies and with the banking system.

400
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,100
So it is not a perpetual motion machine,

401
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,100
but man, it has certainly run for a long time.

402
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,100
And it's come crumbling down, and we can push it over the edge.

403
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
And it's going to hurt.

404
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,100
It's going to hurt a lot of us.

405
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:33,100
But it shouldn't be ultimate sacrifice.

406
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
It'll just be economic sacrifice.

407
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
But I think we have to go through it.

408
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
We can actually make a better world.

409
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,100
The one thing no one counted on.

410
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,100
And that's going back to that opening bit that I played.

411
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
The one thing that no one counted on

412
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,100
was this series of tubes that became interconnected

413
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,100
on as the interwebs.

414
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,100
They never counted on that free form flow of ideas

415
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,100
and people connecting across or interglobaly connecting,

416
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,100
and knowing that what happens here affects people over there

417
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,100
and being able to share ideas and thoughts.

418
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,100
And so it is our responsibility to take it down.

419
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100
We've just got, it's like a DMCA request

420
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,100
to the fucking government.

421
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,100
We're taking it down.

422
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,100
We're taking the whole scam down

423
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,100
of lending money to poor countries to come in,

424
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,100
take their territory, take their property, build on that,

425
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:30,100
make sure they can never pay back the loans, steal the oil.

426
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,100
And it's not just oil in Iraq.

427
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,100
It's about water and strategic position.

428
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,100
Please look at the map and look at what countries surround Iraq.

429
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,100
Please take a look at that.

430
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,100
And I guarantee you pulling out of Iraq is going to hurt.

431
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,100
It's going to hurt a lot.

432
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,100
It's going to hurt in a lot of ways, particularly financially,

433
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
but we have to do it.

434
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
We have to go through that pain.

435
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
Because this scam is just too big.

436
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
We're issuing a take-down notice.

437
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
This is, we're ending it.

438
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
And we're going to end it from all angles.

439
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,100
By changing Congress, if we have to change it again,

440
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,100
by changing who's in the White House.

441
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,100
And by changing the behavior of companies,

442
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,100
changing their literal DNA, which may break some of them.

443
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,100
But others will come out.

444
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,100
I think very successful, because I do believe in capitalism,

445
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
but not the way it's been rolled out.

446
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,100
How?

447
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,100
We've really done a disservice to ourselves and to the world.

448
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
And I'm quite ashamed.

449
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,100
And now on to something completely different.

450
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

451
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

452
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

453
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

454
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

455
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

456
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

457
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

458
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

459
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

460
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

461
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

462
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

463
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

464
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

465
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

466
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

467
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

468
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

469
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

470
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

471
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

472
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

473
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

474
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

475
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

476
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

477
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

478
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

479
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

480
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

481
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
We're going to end it from all angles.

482
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,100
Unyyyyy.

483
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:30,100
How's it going, Adam, it's Jersey topped the official musicologist of The Cha Cha.

484
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,100
In one of my all time favorite things,

485
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,100
as your musicologist is the ability to give you something

486
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
brand-spanking new there.

487
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,400
It's actually not going to hear anywhere else you add in theared

488
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,900
slides.

489
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,540
I've got that for you today. I'm very very excited about it. So feel

490
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:54,180
almost the rock goddess herself has a brand new album coming out in spring 2008.

491
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,940
It's called Revelator. It sounds like it's gonna be really really interesting. It's a

492
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,660
whole brand new thing for her to life in modern-day America concept album with

493
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,260
issues ranging from racism to sexism, internet dating. All I know is that the

494
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,620
rock goddess continues to kick ass. Check this song out. It's brand

495
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,340
spanking new so feel almost for your football Friday. Let me tell you something.

496
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,620
Aw man, doesn't get any better than this. Check this out.

497
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,860
That man. Let me tell you something by these motherfuckers out here.

498
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,660
Let me tell you something. My brain has been washed.

499
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,660
And it's Halloween spanking new.

500
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,020
That wasn't too much much. She's just sitting, sitting,

501
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,940
some spanking back. Jumping in the space of day out.

502
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,100
Let me tell you something. Like a jeez free.

503
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:57,700
I'm just better than you. I know my brain you too was so fit you all up.

504
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,660
Well, now that's something to do.

505
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:21,140
Let me tell you something. My mind's been washed.

506
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,940
And I'm coughing. I'm smoking.

507
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,180
That wasn't too much. I'll catch you in my plan. What is this?

508
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,420
To be a righteous dog. Let me tell you something.

509
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:41,460
Like a restless dog. I'm a human alone. I can't hold it up.

510
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,740
He's thinking about going away. I tell you what being on my heart.

511
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:56,900
I see his mind about to grab the greatest blow. I'll tell you.

512
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:03,940
Reach the air. You might have gone too far for the cliff. You're almost at it.

513
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:27,940
Let me tell you something. My brain's been washed.

514
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,660
And I'm tired of what's left. I can't walk until too much. I'll give this to you.

515
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,500
To be a human. Jumping in the space of day out.

516
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,420
You haven't tell you something. My brain's been washed.

517
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:50,660
I'm just better than you. I know my brain you too was so fit you all up.

518
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,700
Well, now that's something to do.

519
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:03,300
I see his mind about to grab the greatest blow. I know how to say.

520
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,820
Oh, Sophia Ramas. Brand new. I was listening to that. I'm like,

521
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,980
man, she sounds almost like Janice Joplin and Jimmy Hendrix. You know,

522
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,940
got completely high. Drank of fifth to Jack and made crazy drug-induced love.

523
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,460
And out pops of fear, man. She's got something going on. Fantastic. Jersey Todd, man.

524
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,900
Thank you so much. They don't call you surfer. Nothing, eh?

525
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,580
Didn't into your show or DSC 700. Do you were talking about a loss of power?

526
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:43,220
And they struggled to get back on to line and you were talking about switching off of

527
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,740
Janice and things like that. Oh, yeah, that's right. The role for the pilot. That's right.

528
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,660
Just a little detail on that one. In our days on commercial aircrafts,

529
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,300
we do not switch off the power anymore because there is a special thing which is called the

530
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:04,260
GPCU, which is a ground power control unit, and that will manage all power losses and things like that.

531
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:11,380
So I believe they've just struggled to get the internal unit back on line. And they're

532
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:17,940
a little bit later to start up the APU. Well, nevertheless, thank you very much for your show.

533
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,060
I really appreciate. And what should I say? I actually believe me. And I'm great. Love you.

534
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:30,340
Hi. Thanks, man. Kind of homo. Yeah, I think that thing that's exactly what it was. It was the

535
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:38,020
even said it was the auxiliary or external power unit APU. That's what they said. But it probably was a

536
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:43,060
ground unit. But even so, I bet you they had some switch down that should have had switched off

537
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,060
when they reconnected that thing.

538
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:19,860
That glue took a dress in it all that stuff. I know for sure I'm going to need too much.

539
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:27,300
Married Jesus and three wise men, Joseph Angels and Bethlehem, come on, let's celebrate

540
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,300
Madness Christmas.

541
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:55,460
Don't happen once again. If you're in your blues, what's worth with this trip? Come on, let's celebrate.

542
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:12,100
Man is beauty.

543
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:28,100
I can't wait to see my kids face, round the tree on Christmas day,

544
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:35,100
Tarant paper and ribbon spline, I hope they did what I did by my card as matched with.

545
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:41,100
I don't care, I'll pay the bills, I'm back next year, come on, let's celebrate.

546
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:49,100
Man, it's Christmas, it's a man in Christmas, let's Christmas that year.

547
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,100
Man, it's Christmas.

548
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,100
Yeah, that's right, and being missed a last minute, man.

549
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,100
They're by, still have not done my Christmas shopping, that'll have to happen this weekend.

550
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
It's so typical.

551
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Just going through some of the emails that came in, what is this?

552
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Marco Hoppa.

553
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,100
They call on the Adam Courier Germany, excellent.

554
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,100
He wants me to, okay, he wants me to record something out crap.

555
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,100
You know, people ask me this all the time, I just don't have the time to record stuff, but what I'll do

556
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,100
is I'll do it here and you can kind of out the show and you can use it, okay?

557
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,100
Hi, I am the godfather of podcasting, that sounds lame.

558
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:39,100
Hi, I am the godfather of podcasting, and I want to tell you something, Hoppa, there'll be some nice Adam Courier.

559
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Fick me!

560
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,100
Okay, hey, anyone could use that for their show, I guess.

561
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,100
Anything else?

562
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:52,100
I think we've covered it just about, hopefully I'll find some time to, to cut no agenda today.

563
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,100
Otherwise, might have to do that tomorrow after the Christmas shopping.

564
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:02,100
I kind of depends, we got one more just before the end of the year, big offsite meeting.

565
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,100
I'm way off offsite for the meeting, so that's happening starting at 4 o'clock this afternoon, UK time.

566
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:14,100
So that may, usually those things last, you know, like into around midnight, my time.

567
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:22,100
And I have a, I have a, I have a mine there to do a show, maybe Monday, certainly some time next week,

568
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,100
even though all of our offices will be, we'll not entirely closed.

569
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:31,100
Obviously, since we got a lot of gear running, and there's always people who want to wander and do some shit.

570
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,100
So it'll be people about, but there's no official work all of next week.

571
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:41,100
So I'll be chilling a little bit, but I probably just won't be able to help myself with all this stuff I'm learning about.

572
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,100
The big swindle that has been taking place right before our very eyes.

573
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:51,100
And with that, my friends, I tell you, enjoy your freedom and please live life with passion.

574
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,100
And if we don't speak before then, Merry Christmas.

575
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,100
I guess I really don't know what Christmas is all about.

576
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:02,100
Isn't there anyone who knows what Christmas is all about?

577
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:07,100
I'm Charlie Brown, I can tell you Christmas is all about.

578
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,100
My, please.

579
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,100
I'm going to be to the moon again.

580
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Stars shining, shining on nature.

581
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Mmm, yeah, shining on nature.

582
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,100
Mmm, yes, well, there is room here.

583
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,100
Oh, I'm going to be to the moon again.

584
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Here we go.

585
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,100
Show me how I've got it all.

586
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
Yeah, you.

587
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Show me how I've got it all.

588
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,100
Some boy and boy, you and me, I got Jesus.

589
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,100
Mmm, yeah, shining on nature.

590
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,100
Mmm, yes, well, there is room here.

591
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,100
Oh, baby, Jesus.

592
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,100
Merry, merry, merry, merry.

593
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,100
Mmm, yes, shining on nature.

594
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:23,100
Mmm, yes, well, there is room here.

595
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,100
Oh, baby, Jesus.

596
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,100
In their world, the same conversation,

597
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,100
I didn't seem to get lots of the drop by the wall.

598
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
I didn't seem to be the Lord, I can't cry.

599
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,100
I can't cry the Lord, John, I'm born.

600
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
And they were so strong, and they were so strong,

601
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
and they were so strong, and they were so strong, and they were so strong.

602
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
And behold, they were the mechanics of the future,

603
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
but some people are,

604
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
but aren't you?

605
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:56,100
They used to be the same, they used to be a star.

606
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,100
You are the joy of you!

607
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Show me how I've got it all.

608
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:10,100
Yeah, you. Show me how I've got it all.

609
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:17,100
It's our shining shine of nature

610
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,100
Mmm-mm-mm-mm, shine of nature

611
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,100
Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm, yeah, it's well-dressed, you

612
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,100
All ready to leave

613
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Some calling by you, I think I'm going to do

614
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Mmm-mm-mm-mm, yeah, it's big, I'm going to do

615
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Mmm-mm-mm, yeah, it's great

616
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,100
Mmm-mm-mm, yeah, it's great

617
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,100
Hey, I'll cut them from having a 12-bit clock

618
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:52,100
And loads of beautiful lengths with this beautiful musical disguise

619
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,100
And say, glory to God in the highest

620
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:59,100
And on earth peace, we'll go toward him

621
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:04,100
