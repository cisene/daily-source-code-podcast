00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Many people believed in the early years of 21st century that the greatest threat to this

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,560
world was to come from the microbes and germs that dwell on the rim of the humble toilet.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,760
As you hovered over the seat, which had once been his throne, man cast out with all his

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,160
might and all hell was spread forth over the cubicle.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,600
Meanwhile, on their tea break, the sanitation service providers slowly and surely drew

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
their plans against us.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,600
Delta Sierra Charlie, five, four, five.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,600
60 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,600
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:01:00,600
I want my fellow Americans at the bottom end of the economic ladder.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
And that's exactly what I'm going to do.

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,600
I also want to go to Washington to get some drugs and alcohol.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:26,600
This background is shady, grew up lazy with the money from his folks.

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,600
When off to college, was a frat boy, did his shit load a coke.

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,600
When in the politics, block his death.

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,600
With his ears and his friend, one on election, the election.

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Maddy didn't even win.

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,600
He doesn't even know who we are.

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,600
I think he's doing a shit job so far.

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Mr. President of the United States.

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:18,600
You are worthy of these days.

23
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,600
He comes on the TV and he tells us that we're winning the war.

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,600
People like Paulie, they are asking what we find in Paul.

25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
He doesn't listen.

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Maddy keeps on. He's got too much to prove.

27
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Well Mr. President, can you hear this book?

28
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:54,600
He doesn't even stop to ask why.

29
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,600
He just thinks Jesus wants people to die.

30
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Mr. President of the United States.

31
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,600

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Mr. President of the United States.

314
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Mr. President of the United States.

315
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
What happened to the audio on DSC 544?

316
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,600
I have a plane vanilla Mac, iTunes 7, and a 30 gig iPod set up here.

317
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,600
And I noticed that playback from my iPod stopped straight after ped up sting and before

318
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
the guest intro today.

319
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
It was about 19 seconds in according to my iPod.

320
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I fast forwarded over that and listened to the show.

321
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
And about 11 minutes in, it sounded like you had a visit from Crichton Wheeler,

322
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,600
the radio presenter who suffered from splices disease.

323
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
I couldn't bear to listen from my iPod,

324
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
and so I used quick time to play the show in my browser,

325
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
clicking on the link from Carried.com.

326
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Peter was missing, and so was the splices disease.

327
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Why was there no ped up on the link from the show notes?

328
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
And why did that version not have the silences and repeated phrases

329
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
that the iPod version had?

330
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Inquiring minds want to know.

331
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Do we?

332
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Do we?

333
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
That's Dutch for us.

334
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
See ya.

335
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Yeah, thanks for calling that in.

336
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,600
We've received sporadic reports of the show breaking up

337
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,600
or skipping ahead or definitely being corrupted.

338
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
And passed it on to end to Grummit,

339
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,600
who is now, who can't see anything at the top level,

340
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
who's now into deep debugging mode.

341
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Here's one thing we have narrowed down.

342
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,600
First of all, you access the link.

343
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
You probably subscribe to the show through,

344
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
well, that's a good question actually.

345
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Through the US.

346
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
So you would be receiving your file from the US server,

347
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,600
which is media.potshow.com or something like that.

348
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
And I believe it has something to do with the insertion

349
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
before the show.

350
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Now, from time to time, when players change,

351
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,600
and I know that iTunes underwent some change recently,

352
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
things can get screwed up.

353
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
It's very hard to replicate these errors,

354
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,600
but I think it does have to do with the add insertion.

355
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
So we're looking at that.

356
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,600
The reason why you didn't get that from the link at curry.com

357
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,600
is because me being over here,

358
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,600
when I select a link, it's going to be actually the link that I post up there

359
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,600
is my media.btpotshow.com.

360
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
And whenever, whenever I'm in the UK,

361
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm going to serve you up the UK version of the file,

362
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
which if there was UK advertising,

363
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
which there wasn't in this case,

364
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
that's why you didn't hear anything in front of the show.

365
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
You get served up the UK advertising.

366
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
When I'm in San Francisco, then you get the US advertising.

367
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
It's in a whole nother issue by itself.

368
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
But I think that there is something, indeed,

369
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
that's changed somewhere along the line.

370
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,600
It seems like it's happening with iTunes.

371
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
But not consistently, of course.

372
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
If you witnessed this problem,

373
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
please let me know.

374
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
You know, with some cool news,

375
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,600
looks like a Potio may be entering the German market very soon.

376
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,600
So all of this sits in Pinkland.

377
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
sits in Pinkland is very topical,

378
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
because I need to have a little more than my

379
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,600
bastardized Dutch to German communication skills,

380
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
when I'm talking to really important people in the,

381
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
in the German speaking marketplace.

382
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,600
So maybe you could help me out.

383
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
I mean, so far, let's see,

384
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
that got this, what is this from Fabian Fry,

385
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
who wants to interview me over Skype.

386
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
He's doing his master thesis on podcasting.

387
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
And he says, unfortunately,

388
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,600
you didn't get the endings quite right in your German lessons.

389
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Let me help you with the words written out.

390
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,600
So again, this is for those of us who are now practicing

391
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
the fine art of sitting down

392
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
while doing anything in the bathroom.

393
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
And so in German, which, of course,

394
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
the Germans have, once again,

395
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
that leading the charge on this,

396
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Germans are sitting down to Tinkle,

397
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
everywhere in the world.

398
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
So that would be sits in Pinkland.

399
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
That would be the act of doing it.

400
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
In sits in Pinkland.

401
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,600
And this is, this is something that I could just say

402
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
conversationally, as I'm talking to,

403
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
you know, big network owners and,

404
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
and government officials,

405
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
that each Pinkland in sits in,

406
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
or if I'm giving a speech somewhere,

407
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
I could just say,

408
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,600
each being in sits Pinkland.

409
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Maybe you should help me out with a couple other things, though,

410
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
just to make sure that I don't make a fool myself.

411
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Natalie Dilkante,

412
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
host of pod shows technology news video programs.

413
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Textrah.

414
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I have written for PC magazine,

415
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
variety magazine,

416
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
market watch, and tech crunch.

417
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Textrah.

418
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
What's Google up to?

419
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
What in the heck is Web 3.0?

420
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Those are the kind of things we're going to figure out together.

421
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Textrah.

422
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Get your extra on tech.

423
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Oh yeah.

424
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
At starts today,

425
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
first episode goes up.

426
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Natalie Dilkante.

427
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
I found her,

428
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
when I was watching an episode of Cranky Geeks,

429
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
which is a great show.

430
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
CrankyGeeks.com.

431
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I think Natalie still appears on the show,

432
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
at least I hope she does.

433
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
With John C. Dvorak.

434
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,600
She's now going to do a multi show,

435
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,600
multi weekly show for pod show.

436
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,600
I think you're going to like it.

437
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
It's very rare.

438
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
I find in television that you can find someone

439
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,600
who absolutely understands what they're talking about,

440
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
because they have the journalistic background.

441
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Natalie has master's degree in,

442
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
was it,

443
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
she has a BA in journalism,

444
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
master's in philosophy.

445
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
I don't know.

446
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
She's smart.

447
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
And she's beautiful.

448
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
How often do you see that?

449
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Well, I tell you one thing.

450
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
I'm trying to get more of that for you at the podcast network.

451
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
You know that.

452
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Happy Valentine's Day to you.

453
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Happy Valentine's Day to you.

454
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Happy Valentine's Day to you.

455
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Happy Valentine's Day to you.

456
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Happy Valentine's Day to you.

457
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Happy Valentine's Day, Mr. News.

458
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Okay, Adam.

459
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
It's me, Brittany.

460
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Oh, baby.

461
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
You know, you're second life girlfriend.

462
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Uh-huh.

463
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Uh-huh.

464
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
I know.

465
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Now, I'm not asking for any diamonds or chocolates or flowers.

466
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Oh, like I didn't buy you that.

467
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
You be honest.

468
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
I bought you shoes.

469
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I bought you outfits.

470
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
I bought you diamond earrings and necklaces.

471
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
And I bought you a whole island.

472
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I just want you to be my virtual Valentine.

473
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Okay, baby.

474
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Oh.

475
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,600
And would you wish Patricia happy Valentine's Day for me?

476
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Uh-huh.

477
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,600
So maybe we can, uh,

478
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
yeah, hook up just a three of us.

479
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Adam.

480
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Yeah.

481
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Now, there's only so long a girl can wait.

482
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Uh-huh.

483
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Besides, I don't know how many more times I can tell Jersey Todd.

484
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
No.

485
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Happy Valentine's Day, Adam.

486
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
And I hope to see you on the island soon.

487
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Oh, man.

488
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Todd trying to wheeze in on my babes.

489
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Sir, Jersey Todd, I never thought he would stoop so low.

490
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Oh, my goodness.

491
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Yeah, happy Valentine's Day to you, Brittany.

492
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,600
That's the voice that you know here on the Brittany Mason show, uh, which is an animated

493
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
second, like she looks so smoke and hot.

494
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Again, someone who looks fantastic and knows what she's talking about.

495
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Check out the grid review.

496
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
She did another show today.

497
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Haven't seen it yet.

498
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Brittany Mason show dot pot show dot com.

499
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
And oh, yes.

500
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
You've heard this voice before, right?

501
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
I've heard this voice before.

502
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
I've heard this voice before.

503
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
I've heard this voice before.

504
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
All right.

505
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
This is the prolific programmer.

506
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Uh-huh.

507
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Who I really like because, you know, I'll say something on the show and immediately

508
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,600
on his blog prolificprogrammer dot com slash blog.

509
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
He'll immediately throw up some code and say, OK, this is it.

510
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I've done it.

511
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
You know, I'm just like, OK, this guy I think is, you know,

512
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
is becoming part of the show.

513
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Although it's almost impossible to understand what he's saying.

514
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
He's worthy of a Jeff Smith jingle.

515
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:12,600
I think boob and ever at your command is the prolific program and revenue.

516
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Hi.

517
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,600
And I'm from the sergeant, just go again,

518
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,600
your vision to DSC five for whatever was today.

519
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,600
I think it's I'd go for or where you said you are interested in my rising

520
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
U. A elementary debut row.

521
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
I'm gonna go by teaching you look.

522
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,480
prolific program you've got to slow down man when you're talking you've got to slow down take

523
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,800
your time can't understand what you're saying uh this is this is the bridge I'm trying to

524
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:51,760
gap there is so much difficulty for communicators to actually communicate and build things with

525
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,200
engineers it's difficult you know we're both of the same creative ilk yet we speak

526
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,280
totally different language anyway prolific program or what I asked him to do is look into the

527
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,880
guts of the Nokia N800 which is this internet tablet to see if we can use the existing

528
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,560
applications with some simple codes so that we can actually strap one of these babies on the

529
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,680
Trinity as she goes across the United States and further on her world tour all it has to do

530
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,760
is send back GPS coordinates pictures and regular intervals and if possible some video at a regular

531
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,000
interval I'll even I'll even take the video for granted if we can just get the pictures I think

532
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
all of the elements are there it just needs to be scripted out so he's taken my task to action

533
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,240
and he posted some code and and I looked at it and I say well it seems like a lot of the

534
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,560
variables still have to be filled in and that's what he's responding to here

535
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,840
right away described on bugging tree I thought it was a preliminary invitation on my blog just a

536
00:18:51,840 --> 00:19:00,240
out of kind of what is to be done you know if this is all right also I'm not a UI person and therefore

537
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:08,720
I would I would appreciate if you would work with me on the UI as you what you want and what you

538
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:17,680
don't want I'm really I'm really not good about so let me know cheers yeah man I'd love to work with you

539
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,000
on this and everyone said home we're like how does he want what is that and we want to talk to this

540
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,560
guy because this guy's a genius I can tell if you call yourself the prolific program right you've

541
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,600
got some balls right there and I think he on a absolutely understands what I'm looking for

542
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,680
so you know I don't even think we need a UI that would be a prolific program or speak for

543
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:45,760
user interface certainly not a graphical one I mean just start this thing up on a command line and

544
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,200
lock that puppy down you know that's about all that's needed again it has to send back GPS coordinates

545
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,840
I know there's it knows how to talk to a Bluetooth GPS receiver I know that that's baked into the

546
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,680
N800 that has to it has to send that back continuously whether it's connected to a Wi-Fi network or

547
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,520
if it can't find a Wi-Fi network like say within you know within 15 minutes it should then connect to

548
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,640
some GSM phone through Bluetooth it does that beautifully by the way the device so that

549
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,240
I would you don't have to do anything there it'll just happen and then same thing you know the

550
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,920
built-in camera just have that little stick poking out of some metal box that we mount this N800 in

551
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
so it takes a picture maybe it's just a picture of the of the drivers you know the who's driving

552
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,520
the car at that moment or maybe the driver's seat in a little bit of the left-hand window

553
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,960
something like that will be awesome and if you want to give me code I'll be happy to run it and if we

554
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,640
get to a point where you know I think you're actually on the something I'll get you I'll buy you an N800 absolutely

555
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,840
ladies and gentlemen our new friend of the cha cha

556
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:02,240
thanks Jeff speaking of Nokia it's kind of interesting I went through I never thought that

557
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:09,600
this would actually affect me Dave Winner who I think I'll be careful in saying I think he invented XML

558
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,960
RPC it's a way for computer programs to talk to each other and exchange data and ask the other

559
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,920
computer to do something with it you know you're probably more familiar with XML RPC than you know

560
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,200
if you use ecto even if you use cast blaster it's a way for an external program to talk to

561
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:35,280
basically a web server like a like a weblog and say hey I'm gonna post something here and here comes a

562
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,680
here comes a description here comes a title here comes a media object which could be a video file or could be an

563
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,520
audio file so there's a lot of programs that uses and a while back I'm gonna say what like two

564
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,720
years ago an alternative protocol I think it's a is it a protocol or a format and I think it's

565
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,680
protocol an alternative protocol called atom alpha tango Oscar mic was developed

566
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:06,400
which does the same thing as far as I can tell and but it seems to do a lot more and it's

567
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,760
seemed very complicated now as a non-engineer I've been able to implement XML RPC across many different

568
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,200
devices and I understand what it does and it just kind of works and it's something that I think is

569
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,240
I don't want to start any wars here on the show but I think it is probably even more widely deployed

570
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,840
on an individual basis than XML RPC is more widely deployed deployed than atom but of course

571
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,000
there are some big boys who use the atom protocol such as Google and Flicker and Nokia has a

572
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,560
an application called the life blog which is really nice because you can take pictures,

573
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:52,480
write text entries, take movies and with a push of a button you can send that to a weblog that

574
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,120
under or to Flicker by the way that understands the atom protocol so they literally have

575
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,000
built in you know upload your your pictures to Flicker and you know with your associated life blog posting

576
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,440
I'd love to have that be able to connect to the pod show network think about it you know

577
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:21,520
Nokia could could turn on thousands thousands of podcasters to using their phone right out of the box

578
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,520
all it would take would be for them to implement the XML RPC protocol next to the atom protocol

579
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,800
and it's unbelievable but the answer that has come back so far and I know people are working on it

580
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,200
is hey we have already implemented the atom protocol it works with Flicker I don't see why we need to

581
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,680
build in another one and that's exactly the point that I never really understood what day one

582
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,520
it was talking about but now I do for us as pod show to implement the atom protocol there's no

583
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,400
knowledge of that in the companies as far as I know so we have to hire someone we have to you know

584
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,520
it's a whole separate development track it will cost us a lot of money whereas for Nokia I think

585
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,680
it would be a lot easier probably one engineer would you know take the same amount of time

586
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,480
for them to implement it on their side and it would work for so many people I mean it just it seems

587
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,200
like a non-brainer if if you use XML RPC then you can use it with thousands of of independent software

588
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:21,600
services and with the atom protocol they're definitely limited so I'm working on that but it was

589
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,920
just interesting to see that something that the day was talking about two years actually happened

590
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,320
and then it happened to me and those of you listening to the show on serious satellite stars one

591
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,560
or two well hope you like that information just see some guy driving around this car

592
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,400
just pick up truck bailers Adam talking about Adam what is he talking about bring on the sexy girls

593
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:52,240
I had him eight to see from Dublin and I'm just listening to life or four on a mouse and here

594
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,920
because you're after getting your essays wrong again and the guy from the north and wrong is

595
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:07,360
not seamless or Shiva which is what I thought when I heard first it's Jay as an essay

596
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,280
think of it's not like SHA why no yeah but it was spelled S-E-E-M-U-S

597
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:23,040
it's supposed to pronounce that as shemes so I mean he's names bad S-E-A-M-U-S of shemes

598
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:31,600
and all the other thing I want to say to you was the artist has been pronounced the

599
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:39,360
country which uses the most toilet paper per head of population oh this is fantastic news

600
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,720
I'm so proud to be in the United Kingdom knowing that Ireland uses the most toilet paper per head

601
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,520
in the world this is great news sorting to some organization called the European tissue

602
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,800
symposium so there you are now you can move on I know from post posties too and

603
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:09,680
the amount of toilet paper is a people use okay all right then keep this on really enjoy the show

604
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,760
scruncher hi hey of course you're scruncher darling that's why you guys are using so much

605
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,040
toilet paper up there I do appreciate your call and I love it when women call in it gets so

606
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:28,400
boring with all these guys after a while thank you darling uh Tony schemes uh sent me an email

607
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,160
a couple days ago he says add them listen to the old DSC this morning on the PDA in the mini

608
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,360
Cooper on the way to work he played a song from a guy called Paul Durham black lab good song

609
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,520
but I liked it better when garbage sang it and called it you're only happy when it rains

610
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,640
if George Harrison was shun for rewriting he's so fine then what should we do with Jeremy

611
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,200
I guess that's my sweet lord he's so fine folder city that's where Tony's from and so I shot him

612
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,840
back an email I said well dude have you played these two songs next to each other that would be a

613
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:07,520
pretty interesting experiment uh so fast forward a few days and AC took me about 15 minutes on the

614
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,040
old violin to put these two verses of songs in question together first verse Paul Durham black lab

615
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,440
of course second verse garbage I'm only happy when it rains this is the new black lab by the way that

616
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,440
right uh played on the show uh not only is the guitar very similar in the vocals and singing the

617
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,160
same medley but it's even in the same key the courses are also very you know let's just listen to this

618
00:27:47,440 --> 00:28:17,280
you know I'm not really convinced now you and maybe if you had done a

619
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:26,640
closer mix between the two I don't know I'm only happy when it rains interesting

620
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,560
well maybe you're right I don't know but I really don't care I think black lab is something completely

621
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:38,320
different and I think it does sound very different and you know you're talking about some very

622
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,040
basic melodies here basic rock and roll structure you know everything does kind of start to blend

623
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:50,240
together after a while um and just like a computer code you know why can't you build one on top of the

624
00:28:50,240 --> 00:29:00,320
other ah we're all out to get our good from someone for some reason I guess huh yes that I played

625
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,920
the pod safe music network promo and I couldn't for the life of me remember who it sent to

626
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,360
to me it was uh Wayne of the worlds of Wayne podcast worlds of Wayne dot podshow dot com a lot of

627

it's particularly good if you're in the UK oh yeah

650
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,960
because of them exchange rate baby

651
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,240
they're fine a bit they're little they're little they're gone so go to go daddy dot com

652
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:16,560
for all your internet and web hosting is yeah that's how we should do it yeah we first started off

653
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,280
with we call host endorsements you know which is getting your audience involved in

654
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,280
uh yeah turning advertising to content I guess is basically what we're trying to do like

655
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,160
folders yeah how many messages a day I get people now saying they're no longer a scruncher

656
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:37,200
of folder but they're a folders yeah it's amazing it really is same for for splendid you know

657
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,040
people still stand standing in stuff the gofers do it all the time but you know the the

658
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,480
bridge like oh don't really understand what you mean by a host endorsement and that of course

659
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,360
because they really don't have that legacy uh the BBC as far as I know it's always been commercial

660
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,360
and the commercial stations here do have you know it's like spot advertising it's uh 32

661
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,640
commercials uh and even some shorter ones I think they have like 10 or 15 second pods I'll do

662
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:09,520
as well for 118 118 dot com but really I think they're actually rules against it

663
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,280
I'm not sure I'm sure someone will be happy to read me the off-com rulebook but I think they're

664
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,720
getting on to it now that was pretty good of course you you you you want to use punky one

665
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,160
let me don't even think of using DSC 3 you know I wouldn't want to take any credit for it where

666
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,960
I didn't deserve it hey Adam this is Dave from the Dave's lounge podcast over at

667
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,320
Dave's lounge.com I heard you mentioned on the DSC a couple weeks ago that you wanted to get

668
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,320
a Nintendo Wii for the curry manner and as someone who owns a Wii myself I can tell you that

669
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,040
definitely is the right choice it's a really cool console I don't I don't have a whole lot of games

670
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,760
for it yet I just have Wii sports and a couple of the virtual console games and those are pretty

671
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,800
much kept me occupied but the other thing that's really interesting about the Wii is the web browser

672
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:07,600
now of course the Wii as you know has built in Wi-Fi and you can download a web browser that's made

673
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,840
by opera for the Wii and it actually does a pretty good job at rendering pages the thing I find

674
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:20,240
most interesting about the browser though is that it comes with a built-in flash player now it's

675
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,120
an older version of flash slash seven so not everything out there works but it sounds a lot like

676
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:31,280
the same functionality the the Nokia and 800 internet tablet has it also uses opera with a flash

677
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:38,080
seven player is the the Wii isn't running Linux though is it I don't think it is but it seems like

678
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,400
a flash nine is coming very soon so that's your change I have poked around a little bit and I

679
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,440
discovered a few games that work and I discovered a few animations that work and I've discovered

680
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:56,320
that YouTube and Google video both play through the Wii web browser in fact I actually find that a lot

681
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,520
of my online video surfing these days is done with the Wii I found a number of BBC documentaries

682
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,360
on Google video and I've actually watched them through the Wii on my television set the quality isn't

683
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:17,600
stellar but it's very watchable and this got me to thinking if it's possible to play back video

684
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:23,920
on the Wii certainly it would be possible to play back audio right I mean think about it here you

685
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,040
have this console that's connected to your television it might be connected to your home theater

686
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:35,440
system as well you know you are so preaching to the to the choir here this is exactly why we have

687
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,720
pod show set up the way it is not perfect yet but we're getting very close because the same

688
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:48,080
information we're now exporting to IPTV which is a set top box version of television on demand

689
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,720
the same version is being ported to a mobile platform with flash and and by the way something that we've

690
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,280
been working on you've probably seen that we now have embeddable videos at pod show I'm pretty

691
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,200
sure that the way to go forward is whenever you upload a video show or an audio show for that matter

692
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,880
that the way you play it at pod show will be in flash so there'll be some shit going on in the

693
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,720
background and whether it happens on your computer or on our computer that's still up in the air

694
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,240
but it'll also be made available as a downloadable file almost like a feature you know if you

695
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,040
subscribe to the show you're going to get it as soon as it's up and if you go look at the show it

696
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,840
may be almost instantaneously but it kind of depends on how much horsepower and how we can figure

697
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:36,800
that because there's always some transcoding that has to take place but this will make it available

698
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:43,600
to any multitude of platforms because that's really what it is the web and flash I think the flash

699
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:49,200
web is probably where is where we're headed next although very very complicated because the technology

700
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,920
has now far outstrip with Ajax which as you know is what makes a lot of these web pages so interactive

701
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:03,680
with stuff like flash you know the metrics of paid views are blown to bits and it's you know there's

702
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,800
a lot of shit going on now with how stuff is measured and I don't think much of it really is

703
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,440
very accountable the one thing is accountable the we're doing is I like that is we're actually

704
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,880
sending customers who buy things to our advertisers door that seems to be working very well

705
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,760
advertisers like that by the way but yeah man I think you're right on the money absolutely this is

706
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,240
it's where it's going to go no doubt about it and whatever device is handy at the time just like

707
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,400
I'm using a multitude of you know it's like Gmail for me I use it on my phone I use it on my internet

708
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:45,600
tablet I use it on my PCs I use you know a lot of the stuff that is web based on any on any

709
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,840
device that happened to be using at the moment so absolutely that's where it's going Adam Curry on the run

710
00:37:52,400 --> 00:38:00,560
lady Patricia here this is why he avoids Holland do you hear me everybody's looking for you

713

lab my friends hey those of you down under have you ever heard of the what the Kembera times

720
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,800
this journalist sent me an email last week and it was like I want to interview when you're available

721
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,240
it was a pretty rude approach and I was like well you know what do you want well I want to talk

722
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,520
about actually I should probably bring that up and not paraphrase like that hold on that wouldn't be

723
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,080
very very fair of me let me just you know it's just one of those approaches that I really didn't like

724
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:26,240
and I have a point to this come on Gmail see there I am pontificating about Gmail and it's

725
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:35,600
taken forever to find this here we go Jenna okay my name is Jenna Price I'm a report in Australia

727
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,320
hi Jenna how can I help she says I want to talk about why podcasting worked for which publication

728
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,600
I send back it was in the subject field the Kembera times which is the broadsheet daily in

729
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,160
Kembera Australia's national capital apologies if you already knew this but so many people don't a little

730
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:06,960
defensive there ah then we go assuming you feel like talking about podcasting good time for me says Jenna

731
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:13,520
730 or 1030 pm your time working I can contact you so go back and forth anyway so I talked to her on

732
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:20,960
Sunday and you know she's like how old are you 42 oh you're just a baby so how old are you 51 okay

733
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,160
you have a daughter I thought you were English thought it was English well yes I am can't you tell by

734
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:33,760
me I'm an accent that I'm from Manchester it turns out she hasn't listened to any podcast outside of Australia

735
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,200
but not even mind she called me up to interview me and she hasn't she didn't know anything about me

736
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,400
and you know this is such a respected newspaper and this is what all with this is why and I was

737
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,240
contemplating saying I shouldn't do this interview but you know I just don't do many of them because I usually

738
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:56,320
get disappointed by what show it shows up particularly from a so-called intellectual newspapers and I'm

739
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,640
sure you guys are going to correct me or let me know if the Kembera times is worth its salt or not

740
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,320
but you know and she just got into all this stuff but advertising and I explained in this

741
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,680
it but you know how can you ask these questions if you haven't even made the effort to listen to

742
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:21,120
what we're doing oh you have a company frustrating so let me know when that comes out

743
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,640

744
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,680
