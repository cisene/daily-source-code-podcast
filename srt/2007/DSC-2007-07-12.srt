We call it not that great.

146
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,060
Agro-1, Mash is it up, it's big time.

147
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,500
Needles, hotel California versus the Hustle Athletics

148
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,180
taking it as noisy as San Francisco.

149
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,020
You can find it at agro1.com or force through Mash of Town.com.

150
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,460
Everybody, Delta, Sierra Charlie 633,

151
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,140
the Danny Soros code coming to you from Swanky Surrey.

152
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,780
That's right, G-Town.

153
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,020
It is the curry manner.

154
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,820
Sorry about yesterday.

155
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,220
It was one of those days.

156
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,540
I just didn't have the energy anymore.

157
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,860
I had to leave early in the morning,

158
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,660
had several meetings at the crash pad in London.

159
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,500
It was great.

160
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,700
I've been going to the crash pad a lot,

161
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,740
which, of course, makes production of the show a little bit tougher

162
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,300
because of the commute and everything.

163
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,700
But Jill Mills was there from the ICAST

164
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,860
and just lots of activity, excitement going on.

165
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,540
We had super-aging Keith and Alan the Face Kingston

166
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,980
dropping by and we're working along on all kinds of stuff.

167
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,100
And, of course, go figure, there was a bomb scare

168
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,580
just down the road from the crash pad.

169
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,500
Now, we are on Charlotte Road right off of Great Eastern Street,

170
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,220
which is in, what do you call it, a shortage.

171
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,060
There you go.

172
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,540
In not so Swanky shortage.

173
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,340
And on Old Street, just down the road,

174
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,580
there was a bomb scare.

175
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,700
So you can imagine that it funny though,

176
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,620
not even reported anywhere,

177
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,300
not on BBC websites or in the news.

178
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,860
But it was, you know, so probably it was someone's valleys

179
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,380
or suitcase just laying around and they probably had to go

180
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,780
and blow that up.

181
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,980
But it was a very indicative of the times we live in

182
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,380
because I immediately observed everybody

183
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,980
because Alan the Face came in late for the appointment

184
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,500
that he had with me about an hour late

185
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,140
because the tube station was closed off.

186
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,180
I think at Old Street.

187
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,860
And he said, well, you know, there was a bomb scare.

188
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,540
And I looked at everyone in the room and I was like,

189
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,780
whatever, you know, don't really responded.

190
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,300
And I was ready to roll out the line again.

191
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,660
You know, if anyone doesn't feel comfortable,

192
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,420
they want to go home.

193
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,060
It's not a problem.

194
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,380
What the hell was that?

195
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
Oh, what does that, is that this?

196
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,860
I don't know where that sound came from.

197
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,060
That was kind of frightening.

198
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,860
One of my devices is burping at me.

199
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,820
So that made the commute home horrible.

200
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,140
It took me two and a half hours to get home.

201
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,300
I was on conference call from most of it

202
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,580
because as we're working on sucking less,

203
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,100
there's a lot of things that are happening.

204
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,700
One of the most exciting things, of course,

205
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,660
is that tomorrow, I think we'll be able to roll out

206
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,220
cheddar.

207
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,300
It's the new channels editor.

208
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,140
And you'll be able to use it tomorrow.

209
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,580
So there'll be some talk of channels

210
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,380
in today's Daily Source Code.

211
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,700
Also on Sunday, and this is something really exciting.

212
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,140
We worked out this week.

213
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,140
Dr. Cockney, our official international sex therapist,

214
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,460
if you've never seen him, just you got to see Dr. Cockney

215
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,020
show international sex therapist.podshow.com.

216
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,580
Just to make it easy, we don't want too many people

217
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,420
finding it.

218
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,780
Or just go to podshow.com and type in Dr. Cockney,

219
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,580
or any of those terms, you'll love this guy.

220
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,940
He will be featured in the news of the world on Sunday.

221
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,940
This is a huge newspaper.

222
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,620
It's totally a low brow, which I love.

223
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,020
I love.

224
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,740
It's, I think it's affiliated with the sun.

225
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,180
It's probably a Murdoch paper.

226
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,020
So there'll be featuring Dr. Cockney, his most recent episode.

227
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,020
We're going to do this for a couple of weeks.

228
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,660
I'm very excited about it.

229
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,340
And this will be about four play.

230
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,020
How long, I think the question is, how long should you wait?

231
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,740
Oh, no, how long is appropriate for four play

232
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,140
before the actual deed?

233
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,580
And Dr. Cockney's in and about,

234
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,300
I think the London this time asking people that question.

235
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,860
So that question will be printed in the news of the world.

236
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,820
We're also going to run this episode on the news of the world

237
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,940
website.

238
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:21,020
So we should be introducing a whole sh-boat load of new people

239
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,180
to what we're doing, and I'm very excited about it.

240
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,660
Hi, Adam.

241
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,140
This is Justin from San Francisco, Long time listener

242
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,820
first time calling on all that.

243
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,580
The reason why I was calling was because you've got

244
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,380
some dude copying analog to MP3, but what about your old podcast?

245
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,420
I was looking for the first show that you were talking about

246
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,740
the official biographer, Tom from Down Under.

247
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,700
Yeah, he's, he's indeed digitizing analog.

248
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,980
What are you, what are you looking for?

249
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,340
We're just, Christina, remember, you were standing in the kitchen

250
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,620
of the cottage, and asked us if we had similar issues

251
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,260
with our kids, and you got all anxious because she was running late.

252
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,100
Oh, my God, classic memory for me.

253
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,740
Yeah, I remember.

254
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,900
And I wondered if you had it hidden on a server somewhere.

255
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,460
How that would really be great if you had that.

256
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,380
And I want to thank you also for messing up the other day

257
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,860
because my cousin and I started a show.

258
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,860
And if the pot's harder could screw up that,

259
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,260
that would make it a sweet ass of themselves.

260
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,020
Then, you know, it's not that bad if we mess up too.

261
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,180
The red tilt choice.

262
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,660
Testing one, two, one, two, test, test, tickle.

263
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,460
Well, you should be able to find that through search.

264
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,780
I'm trying to think if that episode, if that was uploaded to

265
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,980
the podgeo system, if we had podgeo even in use, then I know exactly

266
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,740
which episode you're talking about.

267
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,740
It was when Patricia was in the Netherlands,

268
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,060
and I had the wireless mic on running around,

269
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,260
trying to get Christina off to school.

270
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,860
I'll have to look for it.

271
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,300
Actually, I could do the search for.

272
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,780
He's probably, if you just search for, I would say,

273
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,340
D.S.C. and Christina, you should be able to find it.

274
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,140
Let me give it a shot.

275
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,420
OK, let me just see what happens.

276
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,580
Because we also track show note episodes,

277
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,740
and soon we'll be tracking what you call it, contextual stuff.

278
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,300
So actually, what's being said in the show.

279
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,820
Man, for some reason, everything seems slow.

280
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,100
It's interesting.

281
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,340
Almost like, let me see, D.S.C.

282
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,500
D.S.C. D.S.C. 12th of June 2007,

283
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:30,460
May 2006, no, no, no, no, no, well, maybe it was in that one.

284
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,180
What is this?

285
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,860
Let's see, this is a, this is the best stuff, Charlie, I think.

286
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,220
I don't know, man, if that's going to be easy.

287
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,620
It seems like it was earlier than 2006.

288
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,860
Let me see, this is from, where was I here I am?

289
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,460
Sixth of May 2006.

290
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,860
Yeah, but this is a rewind week, maybe.

291
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,660
I'll see if I could find it.

292
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,820
If not, anyone else just to shove that into the comments,

293
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,580
it would be greatly appreciated.

294
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,580
I'm thanks for bringing back the hip test.

295
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,940
Is it a one-to-week thing?

296
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,180
Should we go camping, pay for us?

297
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,580
Great.

298
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,220
I love it.

299
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,060
I think it's back to your days.

300
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,780
I don't care.

301
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,980
Two out of three is wonderful.

302
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,020
I mean, I got another great one for tomorrow.

303
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,980
Young already sent it in.

304
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,340
I haven't listened to it.

305
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,100
Of course, that would ruin it if I listened to it.

306
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,380
But yeah, indirectly, it isn't deed sponsored by Coca-Cola.

307
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,980
This summer, when you buy Coke, you get music.

308
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,980
You can win an iPod or free songs on iTunes.

309
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,940
And ever since I've drawn your attention to it,

310
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,260
people are indeed winning songs on iTunes.

311
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,740
And we had, yes, the other day we had a guy

312
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,740
won an iPod, so it does work.

313
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,180
And indirectly, yes, it is, of course, sponsoring young,

314
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,180
because I can't have young do this for free.

315
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,620
It's a lot of work that he has to do.

316
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,100
So he's being paid a producer fee for producing both the hit test

317
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,860
on a weekly basis and keeping the site current.

318
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,580
And I'm putting the links to iTunes, which is very important.

319
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,540
That was a prerequisite from the organization,

320
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,620
for the preservation to the soundtrack of our lives.

321
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,340
Very important.

322
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,660
We put links into the people can go and buy these things

323
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,340
of which you hear just a very small snippet all under the fair.

324
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,260
Hey Adam, this is Eric Port-Norgen.

325
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,740
At Red Till Blue Bay,

326
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,540
Bill thing reminds me of Sammy Hagar, the Red Rocker,

327
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,500
and I've got the sun there, it's here in front of me.

328
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,460
And here's the first little, uh, first few words.

329
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,060
I've read it all, it's black and white.

330
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,780
The spectrum made of shade I like.

331
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,740
The crimson rays are ruby red,

332
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,540
technicolor light, red.

333
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,580
I want it red.

334
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,580
There's no substitute for red, red, painted red, green,

335
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,740
a mean compared to red.

336
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,220
Give me that red till brother.

337
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,020
We're going down the rabbit hole.

338
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,260
I do, I appreciate you picked up on that.

339
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,220
That was, uh, from, uh, actually, I really liked the show that I did.

340
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,860
The, the, the 632, we were talking about the society of the spectacle.

341
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,580
This book that Brian knew, uh, 50% of the, uh, the production guys at Pod Show sent me.

342
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,100
Uh, from Guida Boa, and, uh, it's a translation.

343
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,820
He's French.

344
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,500
It's, uh, the, when it first came out, this book caused quite a stir.

345
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:14,700
And, um, and so I actually, uh, let me just, uh, go to a daily source code.com

346
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,780
and read the, the comment that Brian put in there.

347
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,860
So what I did do is that, you know, based on a couple of comments that came in yesterday,

348
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,420
um, that really, we do live in the society of the spectacle and, uh,

349
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:31,420
and there was a whole list of things like a bird flu and, uh, uh, uh, a global cooling from the 70s

350
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,140
and all these big spectacles that we just get sucked into.

351
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,940
And, you know, really, that is the matrix, um, it's communication.

352
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,060
It's television is radio, but also blogs and, and podcasts and independently produced media

353
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,740
definitely propagate a lot of that.

354
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:51,820
Um, so it is, you know, we're all kind of on a blue pill trip and, and we're just enjoying things

355
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,380
and letting the information feed in and now we've become information and content routers.

356
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,900
So we, so we, so we hear something, read something at our comment to it, post it on a blog, say it,

357
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,660
uh, somewhere in a forum and, uh, and, and so the, the matrix expands by more nodes.

358
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,620
And the red pill, what I'm referring to and what you just heard referred to is, is really about

359
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,820
breaking loose from that. Here's a Brian knows that he said, you got it.

360
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,780
The spectacle sucks us into the matrix of unreality.

361
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,580
We have to choose to wake up and connect with life, to interact meaningfully with others.

362
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,620
We have to work out it.

363
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,220
Deboard also points out the connection between the spectacle and the global economy.

364
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,420
One makes the other possible and necessary.

365
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,100
The way I applaud good intentions, one, oh, so now I go into the life first thing.

366
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,900
I don't want to get into that, uh, because, uh, that would distract me.

367
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,820
That would bring me back to that horrible thing.

368
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,660
So what I liked about this comment is, dude, you completely reciting the lyrics.

369
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,220
There's no semi-hagar, definitely a friend of the show.

370
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:57,820
In fact, it was semi-hagar who convinced me to take the offer from MTV in 1987 to go work in the

371
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,180
States in New York when he was on my show in Holland.

372
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,820
And I hadn't told anybody that I'd been, uh, been giving this offer.

373
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,580
Because yeah, I was working like I was working on it.

374
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,700
I was, you know, the top post on the, the only music TV show I think at the time that really

375
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,420
mattered, it was, you know, I was riding high, things were fantastic.

376
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,300
It's like dude, you know, what's up with this MTV gig is, is that, uh, is it worth it?

377
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,100
And he said without a doubt, Adam, you should do it, uh, and, you know, you'll, you'll, you'll

378
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,660
kick yourself for the rest of your life if you don't try it out.

379
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,820
And I have to say, I think he was completely right.

380
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,340
And since he is a friend of the show and since I know he'll vouch for me,

381
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,940
dude, let's put some music to those lyrics.

382
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,900
You recited so cleanly from the red album.

383
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,020
Here saving heart!

384
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,200
I've read it, all this black.

385
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Black and white The spectra made a shade I like

386
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
The crimson rays are ruby bright

387
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Technic color light

388
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Out of breath, out of breath

389
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,200
There's no sun to come in

390
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Black and white The spectra made a shade I like

391
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,200
You don't know what it does to me

392
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,200
My crimson shinning density

393
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,200
I'm hopped inside the mystery

394
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Oh mystery of breath

395
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Man, not so thin, soft like a hot

396
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
My love, got it covered

397
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,200
My love, got it covered

398
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
My drama, got it covered

399
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
My love, got it covered

400
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
My love, got it covered

401
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,200
My love, got it covered

402
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,200
My love, got it covered

403
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,200
That's one of the things I like to say

404
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,200
I'm on the bed

405
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:10,480
Now it's like a bit of hay going on a Thursday.

406
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:17,880
All right, those of you in the Potsay Police, please don't worry, Sam is going to vouch for

407
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
me.

408
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,160
I don't have a prior permission, but I'm sure it'll be okay.

409
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,040
And by the way, I had to buy the entire Red Album to get one track, and Napster wouldn't

410
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,200
let me just download and buy one track.

411
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,000
I had to buy the Album for $9.95, so I invested in this, Red.

412
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,880
And of course, I expect all of you here on the Charlie to absolutely be swallowing the Red

413
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,160
pill.

414
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,320
So this Saturday is it's black, black Saturday.

415
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
Mm-hmm.

416
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,640
It's when the copyright royalty board approved vote goes into effects, and all internet

417
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:58,680
radio on July 15th will have to pay fees for music played by the person.

418
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,600
And this is, so there's a lot of news about it cropping up today.

419
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,920
Jack Myers report, which I read religiously, says this promises to put many broadcasters

420
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,880
from mom and pops to Pandora out of business.

421
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,880
See live 365 of which I'm a card-carrying member.

422
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Let's see what they say.

423
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
Hold on.

424
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,560
What are they going to do?

425
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,640
They have no plans to go dark, and they also currently have no plans to pay the increased

426
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
fees.

427
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Okay.

428
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,200
We'll see how that works out.

429
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,880
There are a lot of people sending in questions about this.

430
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,000
In fact, here's William Peachman.

431
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,760
If you're listening to your show, via Sirius, my son and I thought that it might be

432
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,120
fun to put together a podcast.

433
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,960
Gee, how many of your fanletters start out that way.

434
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,160
So here you have a mixer, three mics, and this is an extension to our other hobby amateur

435
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
radio.

436
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Send me a QSL.

437
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,160
Uh, you can see our little studio on our side, but we can never foresee legislation

438
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,560
such as going to an effect in going into effect here in the U.S. come this Sunday.

439
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
I'm sorry.

440
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
The 15th of Sunday.

441
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,120
As you know, via the copyright royalty board, we do not understand what happens when

442
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,640
a source from music has via the podcast music network, nor how creative comments works

443
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,960
here in the U.S. are creative comments, agreements, recognized under U.S. law.

444
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,960
Uh, well, I think we've proven that they certainly work under international law.

445
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,560
If we only use music on the podcast music network, what impact does this law have upon us?

446
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,880
Do I have some sort of record keeping burden, blah, blah, blah, blah.

447
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
Okay.

448
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
So here's the deal.

449
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,120
Um, if you are creating an internet radio stream, then just the fact that you have

450
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,120
the channel, you are obliged by law, so this is like taxes.

451
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,760
You have to pay $500 a year.

452
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,480
This does not count for podcasts.

453
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,560
This is for streaming the streaming version of internet radio.

454
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,880
Um, so you have to do that no matter what no matter what music you play.

455
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,360
In fact, if I was going to overturn anything about the copyright royalty boards, uh,

456
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,120
decision, I would say that would be the thing to overturn.

457
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,360
Take away the $500 minimum payment.

458
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,880
That's horseshit.

459
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,040
Because it states very clearly in this compulsory law, uh,

460
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,960
mandatory, uh, what is the, um, what's the word I'm looking for?

461
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,520
Uh, not compulsory, not mandatory.

462
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Statutory.

463
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
There you go.

464
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Statutory.

465
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
Woohoo.

466
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,280
Um, which means, uh, guys who one day will have a statue,

467
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,040
erected for them.

468
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,800
For sure you pay this.

469
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:37,440
You are allowed to play music royalty free if you have a prior arrangement with the artist.

470
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,240
Well, you have exactly that.

471
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,080
If you're a member of the Podsake Music Network, it is a license.

472
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,320
You have to check the boxes.

473
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
You have to agree.

474
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,440
It's completely valid.

475
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,760
You have the right to play that and not pay anything.

476
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,080
Now, the record keeping part.

477
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,760
I'm not too sure about, um, the easiest way to do it, of course.

478
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,080
Again, Podsake Music Network, music.pot show.com is to just tick off the box when

479
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,080
you've played the song, which is the agreement in which you are obliged to do by the terms

480
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
of the license.

481
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
Anyway.

482
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,280
That's your record right there.

483
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,760
And how many people listen?

484
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Well, you know, you guys, you might have to hand over your, your download request if someone

485
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,520
comes asking, but I'm pretty sure all your streams or Harvey, you do that.

486
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:24,600
But I'm pretty sure that, um, that it's not going to be too tough, uh, to prove what you're

487
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,840
doing.

488
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,640
And, um, you know, it's kind of up to see who's going to be first, who's really going

489
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,320
to go all Podsake and then, uh, and report that as such and say, look, I don't know

490
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,440
you anything else, but my 500 bucks, and that again, really, I think if any bill is going

491
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,360
to be created, that is the thing to overturn, uh, but as far as, um, uh, all legal opinions

492
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,320
I've received, I am not a lawyer, of course, and we're just at the beginning of all the

493
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,360
crap that's about to happen with this, um, uh, I think you're in pretty good shape.

494
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,120
This is only just, you know, there's so much going on right now, uh, you, you've probably

495
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,840
seen that EMI is considering, uh, a bid from a, um, hedge fund for, I think, 2 billion

496
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
pounds.

497
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,120
It was like three or four billion dollars from a outrageous amount, and they keep saying,

498
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:17,360
and look, they have, uh, you know, like Madonna on their label, wow, um, where is the

499
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
shoot?

500
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,360
I thought I would save this for sure.

501
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,240
Anyway, you know, Australia, uh, the Australian version of, uh, I guess could be Ask

502
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,560
at BMI and the RIA, it's all kind of the mainstream music industry.

503
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,840
They have decided to raise the rates, uh, for performance rights in bars and clubs, and

504
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm talking about significant, uh, rate increase, like 50 cents to three bucks.

505
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,360
So the way they do it, just so you know, this is exactly how the music business works.

506
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,960
If you have a bar, if you have a cafe, if you have a, um, uh, a dance, uh, hall, if you

507
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:57,520
got a dance, if you've got a dance hall with the lunches, and that's how I'm system.

508
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,240
If you got any of that, you have to pay by the, by the capacity of people that can fit

509
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
in there.

510
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,680
Well, of course, you're probably, if you got a, if you got some kind of rave set up,

511
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,000
you know, you're probably not playing anything mainstream, and it's all self-created

512
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
beats.

513
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,160
But still, you know, there's, you have to have, you know, all kinds of proof that you're

514
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,480
actually playing the stuff pod safe, and, you know, you have the agreement, so I think

515
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,920
the pod safe music network will help there as well.

516
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,320
Um, and this is what's happening.

517
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,680
And by the way, there are plenty of people in the music industry who really are in it

518
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,480
for the music, and really do love the music and love getting music out to people and just

519
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
love music.

520
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,960
And I know lots of people at record companies who, um, who really feel that way, but

521
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,640
this is the work of the lawyers, and they really run the show.

522
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,640
Yeah, geez.

523
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,240
Was it two years ago, Ron and I were at, uh, Sony music, and I reported back that the

524
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,560
carpets are all afraid, and there's only suits walking around with, you know, legal pads

525
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,760
and stuff, because it's become a lawyer business.

526
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,160
So while they're, you know, look, if you have to prop up a two billion pound valuation

527
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,160
in your EMI, well, you better show that you can get that money somehow, and the way you do

528
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,000
it is by raising rates everywhere.

529
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,760
And of course, that will end.

530
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,720
There's going to be a number of people who can continue to pay that, but at a certain

531
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,680
point, we're all just going to snap.

532
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,880
This is what happened with us in independent radio.

533
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,320
We snapped a long time ago when we started the pod safe music network.

534
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,320
That was, for me, that was really, look, fuck it, there's lots of other great songs out

535
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
there.

536
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm just not interested anymore.

537
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,320
You have a very limited selection mainstream record music industry, guys.

538
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,280
And there's so much more out there, which I love.

539
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,240
I love your stuff, too, but, you know, if you're going to make an impossible, then so

540
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
be it.

541
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
It's just going to be impossible.

542
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
People will snap.

543
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
Bars will snap.

544
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,520
It will just become impossible to, to make money.

545
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,560
So either they go out of business, or they switch to an alternative source of music.

546
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,960
And of course, I would recommend the pod safe music network because it has all the shit in

547
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,240
there that we need already.

548
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,680
If the music that you like isn't in there, then help get it in.

549
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Go find some.

550
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Go find your buddies.

551
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,040
Tell them to put their music up.

552
00:28:54,040 --> 00:29:01,120
It's great promotion, and it does move product for the artist.

553
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Unbelievable.

554
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,200
It's so easy for us to walk into this gaping hole that's being left open.

555
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,120
I predict within the next year that will be a chain of some sort.

556
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,880
Some retail chain is going to go completely pod safe.

557
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,240
Easy for me to predict because I'm actually working on that, of course.

558
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,760
Yeah, this is Steve's Sacramento coin.

559
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,480
I got two questions for you.

560
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,760
What ever happened to the format change, you're going to do, like, weekly or daily geeks?

561
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,160
Uh, yeah, it's a vans.

562
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,920
Yes, well, here's what happens.

563
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,880
You know, my life long dream is to just sit here every single day.

564
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,600
And if I had the time, I'd do it seven days a week and just talk crap and play songs

565
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,600
and have fun and noodle back and forth to you guys.

566
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
That's what I love doing.

567
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
It's what I do best.

568
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,600
It's really what my career has been.

569
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,760
Um, so there's all this other stuff.

570
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,040
You know, in order to enable that, well, we have to have the infrastructure.

571
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,080
We have to have a pod show.

572
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,360
We have to have the pod safe music network.

573
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,080
All of that takes time.

574
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,000
We're working on two continents at the same time.

575
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,520
I'm usually on the phone until 11 or 11 p.m. or midnight because San Francisco is still

576
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,920
in the middle of their day, um, you know, but there's also a whole day over here.

577
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,200
So I get up early and, uh, and get my stuff done.

578
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,000
And somewhere in between all of that, I fit in making the show and really, I just

579
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,320
don't have the production time to pull it all together, um, then I apologize.

580
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,840
It really does suck, but one day, you know, that, that would be my immediate goal

581
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,160
is one day to have this company running so smoothly.

582
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:42,720
And so well, oil that I can step back from, uh, well, constantly fixing the gears

583
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:52,000
and and putting in new, uh, new catalysts and then carburetors and fuel injection pieces.

584
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,080
And, you know, and just kick back and do the show.

585
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,520
So I apologize, uh, just hasn't paned out, but also I have to say the savants that we

586
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,680
do have are doing quite a job of keeping the savant quotient high in the program.

587
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,480
Don't mind, as though I like to keep with the original format and then people

588
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,120
going to ask you what happened to, uh, CSP, what happened to that, uh, second life avatar

589
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
check.

590
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
Can't remember named Brittany, you think?

591
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Thanks, man.

592
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,880
Yeah, you mean, um, Brittany Mason?

593
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,280
That's right, Brittany Mason.

594
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,320
Well, she kind of runs, uh, the pod show island in second life for me.

595
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,920
Um, I do have to reconnect with her.

596
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,760
Uh, while you were saying that, here we go.

597
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,920
This is one, there was one more thing that I wanted to put in check this out.

598
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,200
Hey, Adam, uh, Bob Evans from Birmingham, uh, so your messages are coming through against

599
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
that.

600
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,880
I thought I'd leave another one at the repeat of when I left earlier.

601
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,920
You've been promising a conversation with your Uncle Don and some of which I'm sure was

602
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,720
going to include his thoughts about the original George Bush and the current.

603
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,960
Man, I'd love to hear that interview before George W. Bush leaves office.

604
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,960
So get on it.

605
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,480
Anyway, um, with listening to this show and thought I'd call in, uh, if you're interested

606
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,600
by the way, this is coming in from an iPhone, which, uh, is the same device I was using

607
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,200
worse into the day we source code on.

608
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,400
So I just said, ah, gotta talk to Adam, you get the button on the phone and it stopped

609
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,000
the podcast and now I hit the end call and it'll go back to the podcast.

610
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Yeah, later.

611
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,160
That's beautiful, man.

612
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,800
So it worked.

613
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,600
One device does all you were listening to me and you could use the same device to call

614
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
back.

615
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,040
Ah, it's loving that.

616
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:34,680
Yeah, second week of August, we have a curry family reunion in New York, upstate

617
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:41,080
and Armank, uh, where Uncle Don lives with Aunt Meg, uh, Aunt Meg is my dad's sister.

618
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,320
And it's going to be the big to do.

619
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,080
It's going to be a boatload of people.

620
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,040
And that is when I'm going to nail down Uncle Don.

621
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,120
We're going to do a nice, long sit down chat.

622
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,480
I hope to be able to do enough for two or three episodes.

623
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,880
And I think, uh, I think it will blow you away when we really get into, uh, and I think

624
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,120
he's going to be pretty darn open, you know, he's, um, he's now 80, I think he's close to

625
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
it.

626
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,600
Uh, and the guy is still just, you know, in New York every day and he's, you know, saving

627
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
the world.

628
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,040
It reminds me, of course, a lot of my grandfather, my grandfather was at his Remington

629
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,480
typewriter, you know, banging out letters to his congressman every single day and night.

630
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,080
Uncle Don was in the midst of it all, uh, and the midst of the Bush administration.

631
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,160
And, uh, had some very poignant views on the, uh, the current Bush administration.

632
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,480
So, uh, yeah, you can count on it for sure.

633
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Adam, hello.

634
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
This is a bit of a sound scene tour.

635
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
I'm on Shostown, we have a UW-1.

636
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,720
Shostown, we have a new W1 in the heart of London.

637
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
So, hope.

638
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,760
I'm sitting outside and laying his arm with the, uh, terrible.

639
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,760
You mean, lemme's rabble.

640
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
Terrible production has been going for too many years.

641
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,720
It's all of your lovely, uh, Americans' factories seem to adore so much.

642
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,920
I guess because it has a, uh, post-face, little girl on fun.

643
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,520
Anyway, hey, yeah, that's a sound of, uh, back all the past nine in the morning and

644
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,800
the half past, can't remember.

645
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:06,000
I just want to say, um, Shostown, you're always on the money, uh, really enjoy listening

646
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,840
to the CSB, uh, comments, um, and in contrast to that, as Adam said,

647
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,840
you can try to review from, uh,

648
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
what's his face?

649
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
No, I don't.

650
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Oh, I really enjoy listening to him too.

651
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,840
I don't know if I'm going to get so well now, up by him.

652
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
What's your problem, guys?

653
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Back out, chill.

654
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:31,840
Um, and the issue of, uh, Americans being ignorant and, um, what have you that, uh,

655
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,840
that, uh, prolific programmer, sorts of that.

656
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
Um, I think you're being a bit ignorant yourself.

657
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,840
Okay, you can't judge a nation on one or two people.

658
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Um, and, um, and what I'd say to come to Shostown is, uh,

659
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,840
and I'm going to post a program and say you're a great guy, but he doesn't,

660
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
but he can get in.

661
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
All right.

662
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
All right.

663
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
All right.

664
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,840
You kind of lost it there at the end, but I understood what you were saying.

665
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Yeah.

666
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
I thank you very much.

667
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,840
I was waiting for someone to call it and say they actually are a fan of Nylon because, uh,

668
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
uh, you're right.

669
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840
Contrarian views are extremely important to me.

670
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,840
Um, it's, uh, it is, you know, if you want to feed me the machine, then you got to say something

671
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
completely the opposite to what I'm thinking.

672
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Hello.

673
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,840
He's Nylon.

674
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,840
I'll spoken to Beatriz.

675
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,840
He's in London, but he's from New York.

676
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Whoa.

677
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
He's Nylon.

678
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
Contrarian views.

679
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,840
He's in London, but he's from New York.

680
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Come on in Nylon.

681
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Hey, Adam.

682
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
It's the Nylon.

683
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
Whew.

684
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
After a week of battering, um,

685
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
I'm still standing.

686
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
But here's my points today.

687
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,840
Um, a lot of personal comments and very little discussion and dialogue on the issues.

688
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Let me get to a couple of things.

689
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,840
No.

690
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Nylon.

691
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
Welcome to show business, my friend.

692
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Of course, no one's ever going to address the issues.

693
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
It's all about the spectacle.

694
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
Not an actor.

695
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
I'm not on the part show payroll.

696
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,840
I'm a successful executive with a successful,

697
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,840
working for a successful company living in a wealthy suburb just like Adam.

698
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Okay.

699
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
Dude.

700
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
I appreciate it.

701
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
Just for once the next time you call in,

702
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,840
if you tell us what you do.

703
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
Um, so that's me.

704
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,840
Now for about 8,000 of you who attend to have a lot of comments about me.

705
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,840
I would like you to also have a full disclosure when you call,

706
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,840
particularly when you criticize me,

707
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,840
others or actually support Adam.

708
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,840
And therefore, I would like you to say also,

709
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,840
um, to let us know if you have any professional,

710
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,840
contractual or financial interest in the part show.

711
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Dude.

712
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
Dude.

713
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
Dude.

714
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
Dude.

715
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Dude.

716
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
You're so misguided.

717
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Nylon.

718
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
I wish.

719
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,840
I wish I had the whole company listening to this show.

720
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,840
You know, hard it is to get the people in the company to listen to this program.

721
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
Let alone call in.

722
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
No.

723
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
I can tell you right now.

724
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Not a single person who's ever said anything about you on this program.

725
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Has any financial business,

726
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
professional, etc.

727
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,840
relationship with Pod Show with me or this program.

728
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,840
But that sort of disclaimer you would have in any other arena when you're making comments.

729
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,840
If you do have any sort of affiliation with Pod Show,

730
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:13,840
give us a chance to then understand if you buy it or there's a self-interest involved in your comments.

731
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Now, about the comments.

732
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:22,840
If you think I'm an asshole because I'm discussing product push versus marketing lead strategies.

733
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,840
Well, then you've already never worked in any major company because every company deals with that.

734
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,840
So tell me why that's an unreasonable perception.

735
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Let's talk about that issue.

736
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:39,840
If you think I'm unreasonable for thinking that hiring a print journalist who hasn't like any invention in the last five years.

737
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Okay. Now, I'm just going to jump in here.

738
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Nylon, you're doing okay.

739
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,840
But then you say such blatant things about John C. DeVorac.

740
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,840
I think you should back that up because DeVorac.

741
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
Let me just give you one thing.

742
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,840
The reason why I really want to DeVorac is cranky geeks.

743
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
When I saw cranky geeks and we've got a show for you, man.

744
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
You have no idea what we're putting together.

745
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
It's going to be awesome.

746
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840
He brings credibility.

747
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
I don't have to explain that.

748
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
He doesn't have to be innovative.

749
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
He just has to go with the flow.

750
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,840
For him, for him just going with the flow is innovation.

751
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,840
And he's fine with that.

752
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,840
So it's not, it's not about, you know, any innovative.

753
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,840
He's been a print journalist for 25 years.

754
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,840
He's also been around the block.

755
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
He's seen the hype.

756
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
He knows how to dissect it.

757
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,840
And he's still here.

758
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Kapish.

759
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,840
To transform a technology channel.

760
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,840
Is it unreasonable perception?

761
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Please talk to me about that.

762
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,840
And also tell me how many times you've downloaded tech files.

763
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,840
And if you think the commercialization of Trinity is a ridiculous observation,

764
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
can be my ride.

765
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Well, let's talk about that eight months on.

766
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,840
And I'm still waiting for the announcement six weeks ago.

767
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
You promised to add them.

768
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Yep.

769
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,840
So anyway, I recognize your entourage.

770
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,840
I believe you have a new Ron Hubbard of the new wave, new media world.

771
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,840
Let's just understand.

772
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
I'm a listener.

773
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
I'm a listener who disagrees sometimes.

774
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,840
It's probably makes me, among the most engaged listeners.

775
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
Yes.

776
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,840
But just because I'm a listener doesn't mean I don't circulate.

777
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Right, nylon.

778
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
nylon.

779
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
nylon, dude.

780
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
I love you.

781
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
Of course you don't have to drink the cool light.

782
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,840
And please, let's take a contrarian view to something new.

783
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
Okay.

784
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
Let's get off the Devorex subject and let's move on.

785
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Let's have a word with the nylon.

786
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,840
Spreading the news with the smile on where the roll is right.

787
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Ringo for light.

788
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,840
Let's listen for a while.

789
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,840
And the nylon.

790
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,840
Let's one, two, one, six, two, five.

791
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,840
Six, three, five, seven.

792
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Let's one, two, one, six, two, five.

793
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Six, three, five, seven.

794
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,840
So if you've got yourself a cell phone, put that number in.

795
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,840
And whenever you want to say something, the minute you hear it on the show,

796
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
you can pick up the cell phone.

797
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,840
It may even be the same device you're using to listen to the show,

798
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,840
i.e. an iPhone, or even the Nokia's can do that.

799
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
And call me, please.

800
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Hi, Adam.

801
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
It's DJ.

802
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,840
You've gone point users at org.

803
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,840
As usual, in traffic.

804
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,840
And I was listening to your daily source code.

805
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,840
So if it's as usual in traffic, then you must be from Holland, dude.

806
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,840
Subscribe on the N800.

807
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,840
And I figured out myself last week that when you crank up the main volume

808
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,840
on the internet tablet.

809
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,840
And then crank up the volume in Skype.

810
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
It gets a lot better.

811
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,840
It seems that the two volume slides are not hooked up together

812
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
for some reason or the other.

813
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,840
Yeah, I noticed that as well.

814
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,840
You know, a lot of people have been calling in about,

815
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,840
about me talking about Skype on the N800.

816
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,840
So that might help.

817
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,840
Something else.

818
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,840
You should definitely get yourself a contract with notes.

819
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,840
Because, uh, stupid me.

820
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,840
I've got an E60 online now on the way.

821
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,840
So I've played with that later on as well.

822
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,840
And something you want to check out for that maybe is true phone.

823
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Tango, Romeo, Uniform, phone.com.

824
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:06,840
And these guys basically give you a voice or write the application within your Nokia

825
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:12,840
that allows you to receive calls and make calls when you're on Wi-Fi.

826
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,840
But when you're not on Wi-Fi, the mobile number you get from them gets forward

827
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
to your real mobile number.

828
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,840
So you have just one number and they either forward it straight onto Wi-Fi

829
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,840
when you're on Wi-Fi or onto your phone when you're not on Wi-Fi.

830
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
We're checking out at least.

831
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
Yeah.

832
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
That's it.

833
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
All right.

834
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,840
Yeah, so a lot of people said, dude, you know, this is pretty cool.

835
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,840
We've only heard a little bit about Skype on the N800.

836
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,840
And I have to say it's really completed the box for me.

837
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,840
Now, of course, I had Gizmo, which gives you voice over IP.

838
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,840
But really, and this is just a cultural thing.

839
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:53,840
My and really pod shows entire IAM architecture is Skype.

840
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,840
So we use it for instant message.

841
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
We use it for conference calls.

842
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
We use it for video conference calls.

843
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,840
We use it for a lot of different things.

844
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,840
So I'll excuse me.

845
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
It's a live.

846
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
It went down the wrong pipe.

847
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,840
So I really, I've really been waiting for this.

848
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,840
And I'm surprised that there hasn't been a number of articles.

849
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:20,840
You know, out now, basically comparing the iPhone to the N800.

850
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
Because I feel there are comparisons.

851
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,840
Yeah, just take out the cellular network phone part for a second if you don't mind.

852
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,840
And just look at it as an internet tablet.

853
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,840
The iPhone is a fantastic internet tablet.

854
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,840
And of course, it has the iPod in it and it's interface,

855
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,840
which has a lot of advantages for first-time users.

856
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
And for people who just want to have music on the go.

857
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,840
And it's a beautiful interface.

858
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,840
And not that I have one yet to be able to actually compare it with anything else.

859
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,840
It's coming Wednesday.

860
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:56,840
But you know, some people actually said, why don't you demonstrate the Skype on the

861
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,840
on the N800?

862
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,840
Nothing has a pretty good idea.

863
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,840
Actually, I'm taking one of my jacks.

864
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,840
I'm going to put it into, there we go.

865
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,840
It's now in the N800.

866
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,840
And oh, by the way, the jack, any headphone jack goes in the N800.

867
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,840
You don't have to have some kind of special thing from Apple in order for that to work.

868
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,840
So they have their own headphones with microphone built in.

869
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,840
So it's a three-prong works beautifully.

870
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,840
But it also works just fine with a regular headphone jack as I'm about to demonstrate.

871
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,840
So let me, I'm going to bring up the dialing interface.

872
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,840
Okay.

873
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,840
And I'm going to call my cell phone.

874
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,840
Hold on.

875
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Okay.

876
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,840
You can actually hear it.

877
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,840
Can't you?

878
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,840
Luckily, it's not the actual tone.

879
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,840
So you don't get my cell phone number.

880
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,840
Okay.

881
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,840
Let's hit call.

882
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,840
And let's just see how that works.

883
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,840
So the volume is always at 80% by default.

884
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,840
I like to crank that up a little bit.

885
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,840
Let's see.

886
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
Okay.

887
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
Volume's up.

888
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,840
It's, it says it's dialing.

889
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
There we go.

890
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,840
There's my cell phone.

891
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,840
So you can hear it sounds like it's real, doesn't it?

892
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,840
Okay.

893
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
I'll answer.

894
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,840
All right.

895
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,840
Hello.

896
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
Let's see.

897
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,840
How should I do it?

898
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,840
I'll mute the, yeah, any 100.

899
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,840
So I'm talking to my, I'm talking to my,

900
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,840
61.

901
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,840
61.

902
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,840
Sounds pretty good.

903
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,840
Doesn't it?

904
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,840
And I'll mute that one.

905
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,840
And I'll unmute the tablet.

906
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,840
I'll put the E61i up to the microphone.

907
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,840
Can you hear it?

908
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
Can you hear it?

909
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,840
Can you hear it?

910
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,840
So it sounds pretty good.

911
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,840
Doesn't it?

912
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,840
It just works, man.

913
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,840
I've been using this for our conference calls, which is an 800 number.

914
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,840
So that's completely free.

915
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,840
Loving it.

916
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,840
Oops.

917
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
Let me just put that back in there.

918
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,840
Okay.

919
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,840
In fact, I think,

920
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,840
Nokia, Nokia is,

921
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,840
I guess what Nokia should do.

922
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,840
If I was Nokia.

923
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,840
I would say,

924
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,840
who needs the iPhone when you can have the guy phone?

925
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,840
This is without a doubt a guy phone,

926
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,840
because we don't need no stank and 3G crap.

927
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,840
Two and a half G, actually.

928
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,840
Edge.

929
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,840
No, no, no, no.

930
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,840
Now, we've got the guy phone, man.

931
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,840
We just, we got the clown.

932
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,840
We've got internet access everywhere.

933
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,840
We've got Skype.

934
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,840
So we're completely reachable.

935
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,840
We can be walking around.

936
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,840
Listen to tunes.

937
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,840
Watch and video.

938
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,840
Have Skype interrupt us.

939
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,840
Yes.

940
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,840
The guy phone is for you.

941
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
Hey, Adam.

942
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,840
It's Father Roderick aka the Catholic Insider.

943
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
You know,

944
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,840
you're shove it down to throat strategy for the pot show channels.

945
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,840
Really works.

946
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,840
At least for me.

947
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,840
I had to try it out.

948
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,840
So I said down.

949
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,840
And in only 10 minutes was able to create two channels.

950
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,840
One for all the podcast that have to do with the world that

951
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,840
Tolkien created the Lord of the Rings universe.

952
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,840
And then I created a second one,

953
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,840
encouraged by my success on the first one.

954
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,840
And that is a Harry Potter channel with the best Harry Potter podcast

955
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,840
out there.

956
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,840
And this week is very important for Harry Potter fans.

957
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,840
There's a new movie.

958
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,840
We're all waiting also for the final book in the whole saga.

959
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:59,840
So it's very cool to be able to bring together to create a mashup of all those podcasts

960
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,840
and easily transfer to iTunes.

961
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,840
That's for me, the coolest feature.

962
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,840
Now here's my question.

963
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,840
How do I publish the link to those channels?

964
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,840
I'd like to put them on my website.

965
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,840
I'd like to distribute them in blogs.

966
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,840
But how do I do that?

967
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,840
I just couldn't figure it out.

968
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,840
Perhaps you can help me.

969
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,840
Absolutely my friend.

970
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,840
So I already posted this at curry.com.

971
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,840
And thank you, Father Roderick, for jumping on board with us.

972
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,840
It's funny because yesterday we were in one of our big off-site meetings.

973
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,840
And I was, this is the one I was in the car on the phone.

974
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,840
And we said, you know, look, we've got this two-to-fronts channel.

975
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,840
People are catching on.

976
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,840
And then I think Ron said, well, how about a Harry Potter channel?

977
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,840
You know, this is the biggest thing coming out.

978
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,840
You know, it's surely we've heard of the book in the movie.

979
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,840
And boom, the next day there's Father Roderick with a Harry Potter channel.

980
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,840
So I posted the RSS and the iTunes links at curry.com.

981
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,840
So the whole problem with what you're witnessing, Father,

982
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,840
Beloved Father, is that we don't have the,

983
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,840
you know, we don't have that piece deployed yet.

984
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,840
The piece that is known as cheddar, cheddar has two very important parts.

985
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:07,840
So one is the ability to edit your channels with much more complexity

986
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,840
and much more power than you're able to do now.

987
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,840
The other is there's actually going to be a drop-down box on each channel that says,

988
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,840
play it in the dashboard, click.

989
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,840
You play it in the dashboard.

990
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,840
Play it in real player, play it in Windows Media Player, put it on your iPod.

991
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,840
And this could be a box that could also say put it on your Nokia,

992
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,840
although Nokia doesn't have a spiffy iTunes link the way iTunes has with ITPC.

993
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,840
You'll also be able to get this channel.

994
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,840
Now, that functionality isn't, I haven't seen that work yet,

995
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,840
but we're going to get to that as we go along with these cheddar updates.

996
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,840
So tomorrow I believe we'll be pushing this live and you'll be able to expose that.

997
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,840
So people, you know, so you'll be able to find the links yourself.

998
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,840
People who just come to your channel will be able to find those links.

999
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,840
And we'll be able to just put it on the iPod.

1000
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,840
But even better, you'll be able to determine if you look at, you know,

1001
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,840
if you, and of course, I put it in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

1002
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,840
If you look at Father's Father Rodrigues Harry Potter, Lord of the Ring Channel,

1003
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,840
you'll see that there's a whole bunch of episodes in there.

1004
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,840
You'll have control over the order in which the episodes come out.

1005
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,840
And as John Walker says here, Adam, you've got the interest did.

1006
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,840
I started messing with the channels.

1007
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,840
Looks like a pretty neat feature question.

1008
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,840
Is it possible to filter a show that you've set up in a channel,

1009
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,840
so that you can block stuff from that show's feed from coming into the channel,

1010
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,840
based on keywords such as a title?

1011
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,840
For example, say I want to set up a channel of Mark Yoshimode,

1012
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,840
an MCOF stuff except I don't want to see dire of a madman.

1013
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,840
Well, he typically dumps everything into into the PCH feed.

1014
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,840
I don't like everything Mark does except

1015
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:43,840
a dire madman in my, the hell.

1016
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,840
Anyway, so I understand your question.

1017
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,840
That will not be available when we deploy tomorrow.

1018
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,840
However, if Mark were to create a channel, and this is really the way he should be doing it,

1019
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,840
instead of dumping everything into his PCH feed,

1020
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,840
he'll create a channel which is a collection of all the stuff he does.

1021
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,840
So if you look at that channel, it'll have Pacific Coast Hellway.

1022
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,840
It'll have number one with a bullet.

1023
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,840
It'll have dire of a madman.

1024
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,840
It'll have the badlands.

1025
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,840
And if you don't like one of those shows,

1026
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,840
you'll be able to suppress one of those individual shows in the channel.

1027
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,840
So that is kind of how it should work.

1028
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,840
Looking forward a little bit,

1029
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,840
and we discussed this yesterday as well on our offsite,

1030
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,840
you'll have a search capability where the results of the search can be,

1031
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
a show.

1032
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,840
So whenever that search will run continuously and whenever it hits against your keywords,

1033
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,840
or negative keywords, I guess that's also possible.

1034
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,840
So I want this and this, but not that.

1035
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:48,840
It will then pop in the episode that's relevant right into your channel.

1036
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,840
Oh man, it's going to be so exciting.

1037
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,840
I got a lot of work to do today because deploying this is very, very scary stuff.

1038
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,840
We don't want to do as mess up the work you've done on your channels already.

1039
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:02,840
Yet I would like to give you the capability to edit the channels you have now,

1040
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,840
to reflect the behavior that you can now put into it,

1041
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,840
such as order and number of episodes coming in from show containers.

1042
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,840
It's going to be a lot of fun.

1043
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,840
Oh man, it's been a long one.

1044
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,840
What happens when we get busy, eh?

1045
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,840
Fifty minutes already?

1046
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,840
Well, we can tack on another three and a half.

1047
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,840
Because it's a rave dive.

1048
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,840
It's always, it's rave dive.

1049
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,840
It is.

1050
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,840
Hey.

1051
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,840
Hey.

1052
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,840
Hey.

1053
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,840
Hey.

1054
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,840
It's rave dive.

1055
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,840
So where is this place, anyone?

1056
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,840
Well, it's in a circular motion.

1057
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,840
You just got to ring this number.

1058
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,840
Right.

1059
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,840
It's going to be there.

1060
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,840
Right on, aren't you?

1061
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,840
So what's it all about then?

1062
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,840
It's a rave dive.

1063
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,840
It's rave dive.

1064
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,840
It's rave dive.

1065
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,840
It's rave dive.

1066
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,840
It's rave dive.

1067
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,840
It's rave dive.

1068
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,840
It's just as if people were to move.

1069
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,840
Spreading laugh and listening to shows.

1070
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,840
It's rave dive.

1071
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,840
So what's going to do then?

1072
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,840
It just has a lot of fun.

1073
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,840
Stand around.

1074
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,840
On the head right up and down.

1075
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,840
Stop your face upon the ground.

1076
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,840
To the camera.

1077
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,840
To the camera.

1078
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,840
To the side.

1079
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,840
To the hand.

1080
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,840
To the hand.

1081
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,840
To the hand.

1082
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,840
To the hand.

1083
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,840
To the hand.

1084
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,840
To the hand.

1085
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,840
To the camera.

1086
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,840
To the hand.

1087
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,840
And my friend will such you out.

1088
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,840
That's what brings him roll about.

1089
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,840
They dive.

1090
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,840
See that bird.

1091
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
I wear that.

1092
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,840
Be shaped.

1093
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,840
Propynise.

1094
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,840
Definitely once it's over.

1095
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
I'm going to dive, Dive.

1096
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:44,840
Which will make my dive dive.

1097
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,840
Dive.

1098
00:51:47,840 --> 00:52:02,740
Life, it was my life, I'm feeling strange, yeah we're having sex around time, it's right

1099
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:09,880
time, it's right time, it's right time, it's right time, just as a people in a room, spreading

1100
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:17,440
life, listening to church, it's right time, so what do I have to do? Just have a lot of them stand around,

1101
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,960
what they hate, round up and down, it's not your fate upon the ground, it's you who can't

1102
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,320
jump as it sounds, you throw your hands up in the air, and maybe give a little shake, go to the

1103
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:33,600
bar, and get a bit, go speak to that, who's over there, and then my brain will search you out,

1104
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,600
because that's what brings you to the ball,

1105
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,600
can chill out here all night,

1106
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,600

Yeah, what a knife.

1112
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,700
I could so see this being the summer hit of 2007.

1113
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:40,540
I just blasted out of stickers and trailer parks everywhere.

1114
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,040
