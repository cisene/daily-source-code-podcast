1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Yo, what's up, is your man, Tony Costa, from Costa's world,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,280
telling you to go check out the new Sony Pictures release.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,840
This Christmas, it starts Chris Brown,

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,680
Mackay Fife for Regina King, Lauren Lundin, Columbus Short,

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,440
and it, it just has an all-star cast.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,240
You can exchange gifts, you can exchange the socks,

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,880
you can exchange fruit cake, but you cannot exchange family.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,720
So make sure you check out this Christmas when it hits theaters,

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,760
November 21st, 2007, and a mouth.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's been the next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Fantastic.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's a memory.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hey, Ramadil, isn't it?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Korean with a DSC, six, eight, is three.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Come in, guys, from no long California.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Give me a minute.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I know we can't live in the universe,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
why we're fighting at the chair.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Ain't no other you can't have the edge with fingers.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's a memory.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a symbol, we're losing,

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
we need to move on to believe our love.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
A soul-back, a soul-back, a soul-back, a soul-back.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I got time and time to leave in the anger

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You should try and try to see about the fool by the love

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fool by the sinner

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fool by the sinner

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fool by the sinner

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fool by the sinner

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fool by the sinner

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fool by the sinner

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The fool by the sinner

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The fool by the sinner

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,420
Everybody just knows how to use it

37
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,220
We have a killer image

38
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,060
Just to a side to use it

39
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,760
We have a killer image

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,660
Just to a side to use it

41
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,660
We have a killer image

42
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,100
There's a new love that's no more fun with each other

43
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,500
And nobody is yet self-reliable

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
It's the fools in it

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,200
Some people ask you that you're better

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,140
Some people say hell let you

47
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,280
Some people just say hell

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,340

65
00:03:40,620 --> 00:04:07,900
I was trying to find any kind of substitute I could as a cowbell banging my lighter on on the

66
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,140
baker's rack that is known as the studio here in the condo trying it on on the laptop

67
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:19,060
tried it on the cup nothing nothing suffice nothing came even close okay it's officially

68
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,700
still Wednesday evening here in San Francisco so you're hopefully here in this on Thursday

69
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,140
I'm getting a little tired it's nearing the end of the trip you know it's been on

70
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,340
been a full week now and of course it's been nonstop but I didn't even have a weekend to

71
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:43,340
really relax I got a nice cup of tea here I actually have having like dizzy spells

72
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:51,180
I think I'm overdoing it all righty lots of stuff to talk about today because there's

73
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,940
a lot going on in the world actually first of all there's a lot going on in my world

74
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:02,060
may I just say I am completely loving my Macintosh you know I of course I've been

75
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,740
a lifetime Mac user since my dad brought home the first Apple to I've basically been

76
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,100
a lifetime beta tester and live through everything and I think it's it's you know coming

77
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,660
up to this point and the machine that they've delivered to me now I have to say it's been

78
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:28,140
worth it 20 years or whatever of buying Apple to crap a lot of it crap but that's just you

79
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,900
know just the evolution I guess and this machine so I how long was on Windows I went away let's

80
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,300
see I went away when the power book G4 came out and it had that audio problem and Apple

81
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,780
wouldn't acknowledge it or couldn't acknowledge it whatever the problem was and there was no

82
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:52,300
sight and fix let's see how tired I am no fix and sight oh crap so I had to have something reliable

83
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,220
and of course I was happy to use cast blaster which I'm using right now as well on my

84
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,340
via laptop which is now become a basically the studio and doesn't leave the baker's rack anymore

85
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:08,460
when I'm here so that's when I got the via a nice fast machine very snappy but no Mac I don't

86
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,300
care what you say it's no Mac but I live with it you know I consider myself to be a pretty

87
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,820
proficient Windows user and a pretty good judge of of switching over to the Mac and it is like

88
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,820
it's like it's like having good sex you know it's just really nice I got the nice high glossy

89
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:30,460
screen I think it's the B version is what they call the MacBook Pro I've got the 2.4 gigahertz

90
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:37,180
and I've got four gigs of RAM things stacked it just works you know all of this networking

91
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:43,660
stuff I have to do a lot of networking between machines that's really easy now I love the backup

92
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,220
I love just plugging in a drive and you know just unplugging it whenever I feel like it and knowing

93
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,940
that everything's backed up through time machine I actually needed to store a couple of files to

94
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,100
share some and I was like oh man I got to find an FTP server and I was like I'll just put

95
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,020
on my dot Mac account you know and it synchronized nicely on the background

96
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,700
no it's it's very very impressive you know I think that you know it's as I'm a big

97
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,940
Unix fan and by the way that's one thing that is rarely discussed anymore this thing is it

98
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:17,420
runs on Unix you know BSD this is great I can open up a terminal window I've got a command line

99
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,140
I can do Unix stuff I still love doing some stuff in just command line because it's so incredibly fast

100
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,180
you know doing stuff with files copying them piping them piping them out to some other command

101
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,500
to me I like that still boy if you're touching you heard me say I like piping the files you're

102
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:40,220
probably laughing at this moment aren't you so let's see what shall we what shall we start with

103
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:47,100
I probably the what everyone has been talking about today is that several countries are now looking

104
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:53,900
at dumping the dollar so this is a big follow the money big big big follow the money part here

105
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,340
and I want to say that yesterday I saw this news article and of course I didn't do a show

106
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:06,780
yesterday or today or whatever the hell it is for you tomorrow down under I saw this article that

107
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,900
the FDA had either proposed a bill or a bill was being proposed or they were you know I don't

108
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,660
know maybe they could do it whenever they want but the whole idea was there was going to be a

109
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:25,420
long that the FDA could in the future could create a mandatory recall of products now of course

110
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,860
the only products that have really been recalled that's been that have been in the news recently

111
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,300
have been products from China and it's really fucked up some you know some Chinese companies

112
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,780
you know these big recalls of course granted that you know there was shoddy stuff there was

113
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,740
poisonous and all kinds of stuff that was wrong with their product and quite honestly

114
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,620
I think a lot of products coming out of China at the moment actually aren't that

115
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:53,500
high of quality but this of course is you know that's basically the government saying hey China

116
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,060
if you don't watch out we just might all of a sudden have a recall on all your products you know

117
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,300
and we can we'll have the legal right to do that and I said to a couple of people I said wow man look at

118
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:08,780
that shit that's pretty dangerous and low and behold today the news comes out let me just see

119
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:17,020
China is talking about divesting some of its one point something would uh one point I got that

120
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:25,020
got it here hold on it's like a 1.7 trillion dollars that they have any of them I want to put it into

121
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:34,540
euros or or uh or yen for that matter if you put anything they want but there's a couple

122
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:41,740
so and this of course sent the stock market spiraling the dollar is now again a new low against the

123
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:48,780
euro meanwhile oil is it you know the clothes that close to almost a hundred dollars of barrel

124
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,180
I'm do remember talking about this being a hundred dollars of barrel by the end of the year

125
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,660
I should see if I blog that somewhere if I can find the audio snippet from when I predicted that

126
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,740
and this is and so what's even worse and this is the real the real issue there's you know there's

127
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,300
a couple of things that are traded in dollars worldwide aircraft happens to be one of them which is

128
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,820
kind of cool because you know if you have lots of euros or pounds you know it's kind of getting cheaper

129
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:22,300
every day to buy really nice airplanes so that's that would be considered good my vantage point

130
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:28,860
not so good though is that oil has always been traded in dollars and so because the dollar is

131
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:35,260
so unstable and unfortunately it's unstable in the wrong direction you know oil gets more expensive

132
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:45,420
than it already is you know it's it's real it's just basic economics so in order to stabilize that

133
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,860
a little bit other countries you know they'd like to do some things like maybe buy oil in a

134
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:56,140
different currency and this is that this is the big danger that's taking place I think right in

135
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:04,220
front of our eyes this is a great article written by Jessica Hub who sent this to me someone who

136
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:12,780
was really on the ball oh Michelle Michelle Blasky of course so here are seven countries considering

137
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:19,740
abandoning the US dollar and and of course that is what it means is not good news Saudi Arabia

138
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,300
I'm just gonna paraphrase a couple of these telegraph reports the first time Saudi Arabia has refused to

139
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,900
cut interest rates along with the US federal reserve that means they're breaking away from the currency

140
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:38,460
that's pretty significant South Korea in 2005 South Korea announced its intention to shift its

141
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:45,420
investments to currencies of countries other than the US so there are whispers that the bank of

142
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:53,740
Korea is planning on selling one billion US bonds in the very near future China here we go after

143
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,620
already dropping the dollar peg that means you know basically having their their currency trade

144
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:05,340
along you know if the dollar goes up then they move theirs up that was a 2005 China has more trouble

145
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,900
a bit sleeve currently China is threatening a nuclear option of huge dollar with a calling it a

146
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,620
nuclear option of huge dollar liquidation in response to possible trade sanctions that's what I was

147
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,100
telling you about if they really dumped a whole bunch of dollars in the market they could take the

148
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:29,340
dollar out Venezuela by the way you know how Bush hate shove is well Venezuela holds a little

149
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:36,620
loyalty to the dollar in fact they've shown over disapproval choosing to establish barter deals for oil

150
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:46,220
so that's moving away from the dollar Sudan Iran Russia so what this means is that if these

151
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,660
countries start abandoning the dollar you know there's just going to be a huge supply of dollars

152
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,700
and supply and demand you know says well look if there's all of a sudden there's a surge in

153
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:05,420
availability the price will go down that's basic market economics so it can get much much worse

154
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:13,420
and I think we're seeing a whole bunch of shit happening at the same time here you know

155
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:19,420
I'm also hearing and reading about all kinds of impeachment who sent me this this was another email

156
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:26,860
that just blew my mind this was from oh boy it's now it's really weird that I have

157
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:34,140

185
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:48,460
seconds here try this oh hey Adam this is Bart from Austin Texas hey just want to let you know

186
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:54,780
that you're on the FM radio dial here in Austin on 91.1 well at least in and around my house

187
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:01,420
the thing is I have this little FM transmitter that I set up and I have some playlist software

188
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,380
that automatically schedules your podcast every day at 7 p.m. on this personal radio station of mine

189
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:14,940
it's called Bart FM Bart FM that's right so Adam just wanted to ask you to limit those four

190
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:20,860
leather words otherwise my neighbors may just call the FCC and that'll get me into a big trouble

191
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,820
in case you want there I'm a Belgian citizen living in the US have some history of

192
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:31,340
year and year on the radio in Holland 20 years ago so I thought I'd use this film make two

193
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:44,060
members of all days probably anyways you Adam Curry nice as I could even everybody you're listening

194
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:55,340

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,540
head bangers ball in the 80s and 90s you are going to love banging with Butler it's going to be

197
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,700

198
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:19,580
it's live on the plus TV dot com and I think we're doing it at midnight London time then we

199
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:27,420
re-air it again midnight New York time at midnight Los Angeles slash San Francisco time and it's

200
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:33,900
it's awesome I mean the it is it's what the head bangers ball should be it doesn't exist of course

201
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,180
anymore but banging with Butler I'll make sure I'll put a link in the show notes Friday

202
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,500
so that you couldn't it well just go you know the plus TV dot com that's where you're going to find

203
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:51,980
banging with Butler let's switch gears for a second here hello my name is Tom this for Adam

204
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:58,380
Adam hey I just was listening to actually you're a no agenda podcast I was listening to the AC

205
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,180
oh thank you yeah that's no agenda dot pod show dot com john to war can I clutching

206
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:08,780
I was just listening to you guys talk about the hulu website I've actually been involved

207
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:14,620
I haven't got I signed up for beta months ago and still haven't received anything problem on that

208
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,660
hey this is uh this is uh this is pretty interesting a lot of people are talking about this hulu dot com

209
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:27,260
and I also asked for a beta and uh I know john to war I can't believe that he didn't receive one you think

210
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:34,060
that you know people of the press and someone in the press is apparently impressed with hulu dot

211
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,260
com because a good buzz about it I'm hearing about it everywhere you know just not just from people

212
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,660
in the media business but people like in the venture capital business and there's even like wow you

213
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,060
know what's it going to do to YouTube and first thing I say it's something completely different from

214
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:53,020
YouTube you know these guys are about popularizing media YouTube's about democratizing media

215
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,060
two very different businesses and different business models so you couldn't get one either

216
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,140
I thought if you read the blog you can see a lot of things that people are saying about it

217
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:08,620
they've actually taken down almost 200 posts of negative comments that people have about

218
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:17,580
really what's it uh okay so they're taking away the negative comments that might explain why

219
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:23,740
there's only good news yeah I mean if you don't want to go over there and read that I wish

220
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:30,140
I had a beta so I could check it out but I gave up on it and I saw these at blogs but I

221
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:36,860
think it'd be so you should go back to iTunes and sell them content so that's all I have to

222
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:43,900
buy it so fuck you I'm very yeah thank you thank you yeah yeah and and that's another thing I have

223
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,780
you know of course I get a Mac and I'm using the Mac and I'm kind of reconnecting with iTunes and

224
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,140
it has what is it front row you know you've got a remote control for your Mac so you can control it

225
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,860
and you can have a really pretty good experience watching some stuff and I think I told you about

226
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:05,660
madman that American movie channel series I've now purchased every single episode of the first series

227
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,900
love it I've watched every single one I've been watching like two or three episodes in night yeah

228
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:19,100
just like before before I go fall asleep just watch a couple episodes so it was my point about

229
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,980
Hulu yeah I hope they do a good job because I want to be able to watch their shows online

230
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:32,220
I really would I'm not quite sure how they're I wonder if the writer strike is is tied into

231
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,620
this somehow they're not releasing publicly yet it could be possible

232
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,780
oh yes the writer strike had a long chat with Marc Yoshimo to Namcoff yesterday he's the closest

233
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:49,260
thing I know to a writer I think he but he is or was a WGA member he probably isn't anymore

234
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,460
we were just shooting a shit about what could happen and what the possibilities were and you know there's

235
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:00,460
lots of people say well you know they're gonna want some of your content like fuck him let them die

236
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,020
I'm sorry they gotta figure it out for themselves you know that's their industry

237
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,700
hopefully more people just get interested in what we're doing and shuttle on over here you know

238
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:17,260
I honestly I have watched so little television while I've been here it's I'm this is just

239
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:25,740
more interesting stuff online I can't help it okay let's see what do we have here oh yeah this

240
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:31,020
is in reference to oh boy I get to play a jingle for this one home I'm where uh yeah there he is

241
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,060
I had them for the pick program I hear from San Francisco I know just you've been bringing

242
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:53,420
out calls for Iranians to call in and listen to you and you run well my father is Iranian

243
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:03,180
and I'm British but I am also half Lebanese um just thought I'd let you know that and uh

244
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:12,140
cheers I guess I oh fuck you yeah fuck you too thank you I meant a little bit I

245
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,460
appreciate a prolific program but I'm really looking for someone who lives in Iran you know someone

246
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,220
I gotta put this link in the show notes a daily source code dot com mr good bar sent me a link

247
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:29,020
to a series a slideshow an almost never ending slideshow um of pictures of Iran

248
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,020
and I'm just I'm gonna presume that they're all pictures of Iran what what a beautiful country

249
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:43,100
what an unbelievably stunningly beautiful country you have to look at these pictures you will not be

250
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:49,500
disappointed is just it's lovely and it just it helps me to you know get a different perspective on

251
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:55,980
all this drum beating about we've got to go bomb Iran you know why the hell do we have to go bomb

252
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:01,740
Iran here's I'm not gonna tell you who who who who told me this theory because I don't know if he

253
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:10,140
wants to go public with it but I certainly think it's viable one theory is that uh bush wants to get a

254
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:18,220
third term by removing the uh with the hell is it article 22 or something like that and there's

255
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:24,380
you know boy if you if you google that google George Bush's third term oh man that's a whole

256
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,940
another conspiracy theory there's just too many conspiracy theories that are just too fucking easy

257
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,300
to turn into good into conspiracy theories there's gotta be some truth to this something really

258
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:42,940
strange is going on I can feel it you know that's funny I'm really good at uh I'm not great at

259
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:49,180
finances and numbers and and organizational charts but I've had this knack and Ron and I've had

260
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:55,420
you know companies with 700 people uh and right now I think you know pod show is pretty big with about

261
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:03,900
90 95 to 100 people I have a knack of being able to feel where things aren't quite working or

262
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:11,180
I can look at a spreadsheet and I can say hey you know there's something weird with this cost over here

263
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:16,460
that it shouldn't be that high and we're doing something wrong I can do that I can smell that stuff and

264
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,820
I can smell it all around me right now there's just something really really really funky going on

265
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,980
the red pills are coursing throughout my veins my friends I tell you hey Adam it's atomic right

266
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:38,220
Adam's here you're a favorite red pill pooping atomic energy expert I'm standing looking down

267
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,260
over watching DC from right next to the on international cemetery looking at the air force

268
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:49,260
memorial and thinking about what this city's going to be like when it's led by a man named Dr. Ron

269
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:56,860
congratulations you definitely moved the needle heard even at WTOP here in Washington is talking

270
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:04,940
about how Ron raised a lot of money yesterday let's see red pill folder oh yeah

271
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:17,340
accent as I said that's something for a few I'm curious bye oh yeah yeah I got some nice emails from people

272
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,980
see Paul grass off man we're so happy to see the donations rolling yesterday I maxed out at

273
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:31,820
$2,297 so that's almost the full amount possible looking forward to donating again in the

274
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:37,340
general election after Dr. Ron wins the primary oh is that true can we donate again I guess we can right

275
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:47,820
or not how does that work I'm so dumb yeah the only thing that that kind of pissed me off about

276
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:55,180
about you know the way that this went down is the campaign you know it's it also we raised

277
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,660
4 million or 5 million doesn't really matter but you know it came from 35,000 people and like you know

278
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:05,100
that's not impressive now it it's kind of good because you know now we know that all we have to

279
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:11,180
do is find another 30 or 35,000 people you know that's not that hard to do you know we can find that

280
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,540
but it just looks stupid you know and it gives people the the opportunity to say well you just

281
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:26,380
got a core group of weirdos so I you know I would have advised against that you know I should be

282
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:32,300
on the advisory committee I should build out these guys one way the other so I'm kind of I'm

283
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:39,420
thinking now what should I can play another song or you don't know do it's shit it's a podcast so

284
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,780
you can just fast forward if you don't like it this thing that I'm going to play for you

285
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:56,700
oh my gosh let me just restart that for a second hold on I'm going to play this for you

286
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:02,140
let me give you the length the length is 8 minutes so when this starts playing if you don't like it

287
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,700
just shuttle ahead 8 minutes and you know I'll have some stuff at the end of the show um

288
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:14,300
I've played this before I think well before the show even had a name daily source code I think

289
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:21,260
and um because I've lived through some of the frustrations we're having right now I've lived through it

290
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:30,620
before and George Carlin does a great thing like a great or did a great stand up um about airport

291
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:37,500
security so this is before the TSA let me see if there's a date on this thing when this one this is from

292
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:46,140
this has got to be mid 80s maybe early 80s of course it doesn't say anything here it was added to

293
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:52,380
YouTube 10 months ago so now unfortunately I don't have any any information on when it's from but

294
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,100
you'll you can tell because at the time he says you know you'll even hear him say well you

295
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,500
you know you can take a knife on board at the time a pocket knife for a pen knife was acceptable so

296
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,660
it's obviously pre 9-11 but have a listen 8 minutes I'll be back uh you probably won't

297
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,540
want a shuttle through it because you're just going to be enthralled by how topical this is today

298
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,340
at least 20 years after he's first said it you know I've been out here all this time and I haven't

299
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,380
been complaining about anything yet I think it's time we moved right into the complaint department

300
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:30,940
you know because listen this is just a series of things that are pissing me off all right

301
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,700
because I don't have pet peeves I have major psychotic fucking hatreds all right

302
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,820
I'll tell you this it makes the world a lot easier to sort out first thing I'm a list of

303
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:49,500
night airport security tired of this shit there's too much of it there's too much security

304
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:55,020
at the airport I'm tired of some guy with a double digit IQ and a triple digit income

305
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,500
rooting around inside of my bag for no reason and never finding anything

306
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:06,620
haven't found anything yet in anybody's bag I'm found one bomb in one bag and don't tell me

307
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:10,780
well the terrorists know their bags are going to be searched so now they're leaving their bombs at home

308
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:18,380
there are no bombs the whole thing is fucking pointless and it's completely without logic there's

309
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,860
no logic at all they'll take away a gun but let you keep a knife what the fuck is that

310
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:30,220
In fact there's a whole list of lethal objects they will allow you to take on board theoretically

311
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,460
you can take a knife and a nice pick a hatchet a straight razor a pair of scissors a chain saw

312
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,460
six knitting needles and a broken whiskey bottle and the only thing they're going to say

313
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,260
the is that bag has to fit all the way under the seat in front of you and

314
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:50,540
and if you didn't bring a weapon on board relax after you've been flying for about an hour

315
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:56,620
they're going to bring you a knife and fork they actually give you a fucking knife

316
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,340
it's only a table knife but you could kill a pilot with a table knife

317
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,580
might take you a couple of minutes you know especially if he's hefty ham yeah

318
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,220
but you can get the job done if you really want to kill a prick

319
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,140
there's a lot of things you could use to kill a guy with you could probably beat a guy to death

320
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:25,180
with a Sunday New York Times good year or suppose you just had really big hands couldn't

321
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,740
you strangle a flight attendant should you could probably strangle two of them one with each hand

322
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,580
you know if you were lucky enough to catch him in that little kitchen area

323
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:40,620
before they break out the fucking peanuts you know but you could get the job done if you really

324
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:47,500
cared enough so why is it they allow a guy with big powerful hands to get on board an airplane

325
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:54,860
I'll tell you why they know he's not a security risk because he's already answered the three big

326
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,580
questions

327
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,820
question number one did you pack your bags yourself

328
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,500
no carrot top pack my bags

329
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:15,660
he he and Martha Stewart and Florence Henderson came over to the house last night

330
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,900
fixed me a lovely lobster new bird gave me a full-body massage with sacred oils from India

331
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:28,540
performed a four-way around the world and then they packed my bags next question

332
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,980
have your bags been in your possession the whole time no

333
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,020
usually the night before I travel just as the moon is rising

334
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,700
I place my suitcases out on the street corner and leave them there unattended for several hours

335
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,500
just for good luck

336
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,860
next question

337
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,140
has any unknown person asked you to take anything on board

338
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,820
well what exactly is a unknown person

339
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,020
surely everyone is known to someone

340
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,740
in fact just this morning Karim and you Seth Ali Ben Gabba

341
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:23,420
seemed to know each other quite well they kept joking about which one of my suitcases was the heaviest

342
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,060
and that's another thing they don't like at the airport jokes

343
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:34,700
you know yeah you can't joke about a bomb well why is it just jokes what about a riddle

344
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:45,100
how about a limb rick how about a bomb anecdote you know no punchline just a really cute story

345
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,100
or suppose you intended the remark not as a joke but as an ironic music

346
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:59,100
are they prepared to make that distinction who I think not and besides who's to say what's funny

347
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:04,300
airport security is a stupid idea it's a waste of money and it's only there for one reason

348
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:12,540
to make white people feel safe that's all the illusion the feeling and illusion of safety

349
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:17,900
to placate the middle class because the authorities know they can't make an airplane completely safe

350
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,380
too many people have access you'll notice the drugs mugglers don't seem to have a lot of trouble

351
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:27,500
getting the little packages on board do they know and god bless them too

352
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:39,020
yeah oh and by the way an airplane flight shouldn't be completely safe you need a little

353
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:45,020
danger in your life take a fucking chance once in a while and yeah what are you going to do play

354
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,980
with your prick for another 30 years what are you going to read people magazine and eat it

355
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:56,860
Wendy's to the end of time take a fucking chance besides even if they made all the airplanes

356
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,740
completely safe the terrorists would simply start bombing other places that are crowded

357
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:08,380
pawn shops crack houses pitty bars and gang bans you know entertainment venues

358
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:16,780
the odds of you being killed by a terrorist are practically zero so I say relax and enjoy the show

359
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:22,220
you have to be a realist you have to be realistic about terrorism certain groups of people certain

360
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:28,860
Muslim fundamentalist Christian fundamentalist Jewish fundamentalist and just plain guys from Montana

361
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:37,260
are going to continue to make life in this country very interesting for a long long time that's the

362
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:43,340
reality angry men in combat fatigue talking to god on a two-way radio and muttering

363
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:48,380
incoherent slogans about freedom are eventually going to provide us with a great deal of entertainment

364
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,700
especially after your stupid fucking economy collapses all around you and the terrorists come out of the

365
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,340
woodwork you live anthrax in the water supply and siren gas in your air condition there'll be chemical

366
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:05,020
and biological suitcase bombs in every city and I say enjoy it relax enjoy the show take a fucking

367
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:11,980
chance put a little fun in your life to me terrorism is exciting it's exciting I think the very idea

368
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:16,940
that you can set off a bomb in a marketplace and kill several hundred people is exciting and stimulating

369
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:29,580
and I see it as a form of entertainment entertainment that's all it is yeah but but I also know

370
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:34,380
that most Americans are soft and frightened and unimaginative and they don't realize there's such a

371
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:40,220
thing as dangerous fun and they certainly don't recognize a good show when they see one I have always

372
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:45,100
been willing to put myself a great personal risk for the sake of entertainment and I've always been

373
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:50,460
willing to put you a great personal risk for the same reason far as I'm concerned all of this

374
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,740
airport security all the searches, the screenings, the cameras, the questions it's just one more

375
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:02,220
way of reducing your liberty and reminding you that they can fuck with you any time they want as long

376
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:08,940
as you put up with it as long as you put up with it which means of course any time they want because

377
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,580
that's what Americans do now they're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom in

378
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:23,180
exchange for the feeling the illusion of security I hate fucking YouTube all right and ended a

379
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:31,580
little bit early you get the idea my hero George Carlin man does that guy kick ass fantastic I don't want
