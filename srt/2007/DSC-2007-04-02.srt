00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, these is Fabio, and as you know, I love hair, I love long flowing hair.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's why I love it when the lady Patricia is on the daily source code, because you can just hear all the wonderful hair,

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Adam's hair, Patricia's hair, it's wonderful.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So for the DSC, 574, please let me hear all of her hair.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Sometimes an Adam's all alone, and he needs his love right there on the microphone.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So here she is, yes, the lady Patricia.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The say to have some better than one, and with this angel from above,

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There's nothing that they both can't do.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But make you wildest dreams come true, to grab your earbuds and jam them in.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And let the fabulous show begin.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's Adam and Patricia.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, Adam and Patricia.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Adam and the lady Patricia.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I never meant to cause you any pain, oh my love.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
For my love.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
When you said I think I knew it before then, why love?

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
For my love.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I never thought that I could take it anymore, but you got me coming, going like never before.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And now I wonder if it's all over now.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, and now I wonder if it's all over it's how.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Because I'm giving up just a little bit, but when I stop that's when I'll quit,

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I wonder if it's all over now.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You say you think we need to grow more, oh my love.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why love?

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I think that we could grow forever together, my love.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
For my love.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You said you got me, it's a dream of your life, but you just remember that.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Daisy never became his wife.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And now I wonder if it's all over now.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes, and now I wonder if it's all over it's how.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Because I'm giving up just a little bit, but when I stop that's when I'll quit,

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I wonder if it's all over now.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I can't take it.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, I can't take it anymore.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
She told me, oh she told me.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I can't take it.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So you know I will be gone by the morning.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I never knew I'd be born.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I never really said it till I was alone.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, I'd be the life I'd be born.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
To go on living it if I'm alone.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No, I wonder if it's all over it's how.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes, and now I wonder if it's all over it's how.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Because I'm giving up just a little bit, but when I stop that's when I'll quit,

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I wonder if it's all over it's how.

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,300
Because I'm giving up just a little bit, but when I stop that's when I'll quit,

47
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,140
When I sleepucity it's all over the world

Hey baby voice is so sexy. Yeah, baby ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the lady Patricia

60
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,140
I think I have to

61
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,980
Talk like this then yeah, well, it's not that hard to do because it's Sunday night in Adam's attic

62
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,620
We're here in the curry manner on the third floor

63
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,380
Yes, and the affluent suburb of Surrey known as gulfard. Yeah, we are in G-town west side represent

64
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,460
It's my whole thing. I know you don't listen, but I've been doing that for like a year

65
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,180
Represent yeah, hey baby. How you doing? Yeah, I'm doing fine

66
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,060
I appreciate you coming on the show because as I told you if I weren't doing a show with you tonight

67
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,900
I would definitely would not have done one you would have collapsed. Oh, man. I'm so tired. Yeah, you didn't even once

68
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,500
Wanted sex yesterday. Uh, no, I didn't you're right?

69
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,260
That's right. I put on my sexy voice and didn't and actually no, no, no, no, no

70
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,460
That's not how it went. We were at home

71
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,420
Christina was at the movies with a friend in her first. Let's go to bed. No, you said

72
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,980
Well, what time is she coming home? I said I don't know you should be home like quarter 12 12 o'clock

73
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,540
Something like that and you said well, but we could have sex and I said well, no, I'm really not

74
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
I said why

75
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,580
Say what? No, but I had to get it really early this morning and and I was right after the fact she came

76
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,260
She came home like 10 minutes after that. So I'm quick, but yeah, not that fast

77
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,420
Don't take it the wrong way. Don't take it personally

78
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,660
You know that I'm very relaxed about it. Okay. No problem. No problem. So this is a really weird show to do

79
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,820
First of all because we're doing it on Sunday night and it's the first time I think in

80
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,940
Since you've ever been on this show that there are at least well no, but there are three things that I know

81
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,500
I can't talk about and it's like it's really hard for me because there's all the stuff that I can't talk

82
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:18,660
Not going on. It's yeah, really there is and I hate it one one thing is we're never going to talk about it

83
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,460
Which one was that

84
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:28,820
Help me remind me of course my brain hurts. What was that the one we're never ever going to talk about or or just not now never

85
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,580
Oh, no, we're not going to talk about that one now. We won't talk about that one

86
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,140
All right

87
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,220
Yeah, that was a personal thing. Yeah, very very personal

88
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:46,340
No, because you actually you said yesterday. Oh, that's a nice thing for on the show. Oh, yeah

89
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,300
This is this is my new threat. This is what my life has become is that the only power I have in

90
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,500
You can talk about it. It's like well, I'll talk about on the show. You know, and I know that they'll never verify because you don't listen

91
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
You know, it's not a Christina listen, so

92
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:07,300
No, but I can say whatever I want. There's a lot of people listening that yeah, the problem is is that you know the all the the rags

93
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,220
Listen in Holland and then and they just make up stupid shit, so that's not worth it

94
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,580
But you're working on a great project and what it's nice to see is for the past

95
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,020
Week almost for almost the past week couple of months

96
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,340
I don't know when you're going to say oh no not couple of them now. I was gonna say

97
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,500
What do you think I'm going to say are you are you high are you high again?

98
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:38,420
I'm not the one who's high. Oh, okay, no for the past couple of days almost a week

99
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:43,220
You've been very excited and you know you're doing something very creative and you came up with an idea

100
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,220
And you've got some people involved and then that's it and I like this to you doing that. That's really cool

101
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,540
I like it especially because I don't have to do anything

102
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,060
I just said I have no responsibility in this project

103
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,860
At the same time. Well, that's because you're dancing. Yeah, I'm dancing and and I'm walking

104
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,380
Walking yes and the down walking yeah, every day

105
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,060
You look great you and you know what in this light? I you notice I have the dimmer set nicely for

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,180
Vol I is it only in dimmers? No, no, no, no, no, you look you look wonderful

107
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,260
But I just said notice how I even made it even better with all the light up here in my lovely

108
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,940
My bachelor pad. Did you know I lived up here like this that I had such a nice place

109
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,980
Nice place

110
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,980
So I I went flying today. Yeah, which was really nice and I had my hair done. That's basically I had a choice

111
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,660

113
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,860
You know, there's something about four guys in an airplane that's just wrong. Was it four guys?

114
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,860

Or they use me. No, no, no, no, what is that supposed to mean? I know you always say that

125
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,460
It's not because you're so vain. It's just because it was too long it was way too long

126
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,500
Yeah, it was out of control and you would already cut it. Yeah, yeah, you already cut it in the mean time

127
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,100
I'm very particular about who touches my hair. I know

128
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,580
But actually I still like it when it's long. Well, it's not short. Is it too short? No

129
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,900
There's still that MTV guy in there. Yeah, but

145
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
Something like that

146
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,100
So I do I do I do I do

147
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,460
Oh, man, but in the song that you just play do just one thing that irritated. Oh, really

148
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,180
Okay, guys pay attention here comes Patricia

149
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,980
The bass the bass you didn't like the bass no because it's kept on doing that

150
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:50,420
You know and and and there is a moment that you expect you know

151
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,660
When the chorus and the chorus came that the bass changes into some other

152
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,460
Down a little bit and lays down and really that would have relaxed it a little bit

153
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,300
Yeah, I'm so amazed when you say I mean that that that is so amazing to me that you understand how that works

154

Everybody is

Oh man, it's tough

172
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,020
Of course, it's not but but not not only the song

In her video clip yeah, she has the same outfit on as the star sisters

174
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,220
She does the same things with her hands on her cheek as the star sister

175
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,900
You know as our album sleeve and as our

176
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,860
Then CD

177
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,860
Do you think she was inspired by

178
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,860
You know who was looking and you never know

179
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
You never know

180
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,300
Okay, I got it. I hear right there

181
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,140
That's cool. And of course, doesn't listen to that sound

182
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
Oh

183
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Dancing damn

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,340
But is that a new song is that that's not a new song but very much

186
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,660
Boogie will give you a good boy, and yeah, yeah, from company be from company

187
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Yeah, does sound like

188
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Okay

189
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,260
Well, there's one thing of course a long time ago, and then you know it is different

190
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,420
Well, then she needs the full package doesn't she she needs the full inspiration

191
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,060
She needs to

192
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,060
I don't know try I'll send it to her

193
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,980
No, she has to just to come drop by me if she wants to have the full Patricia pi experience of your your video and you

194
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,340

Yeah, what you she should have that she should have what I don't know the full experience

196

How much is what

197
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,820
But it's amazing and people are talking about it and which is of course. I'm proud of that

198
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:23,220
It's true though because there's so many things now. I should play your song. I don't know where so many things I did and I think I've been there done that

257
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,420
TV because I had two of those screens there

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,820
My computer and of course

259
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,220
But they're like a little bit closer bit and the TV and

260
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,340
That was too full too much

261
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,060

267
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
You know

This was a big problem because I couldn't take away your television and I had my TV on in kitchen it was

269
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Constantly

Your computer was trying to cook

273
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,660
But every time Christina came home and she was, you know on her computer

00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,700
It started right and well, if you came home too

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,580
It's gonna it was it was made. It was causing interference

354
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,180
Most hotels we go to are like family.

355
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,180
Not cheap, because you know...

356
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,180
No shit.

357
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,180
You know what the girl said from your wife?

358
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,180
Was it your bank or was it?

359
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,180
Yeah.

360
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,180
She said, are you buying the island?

361
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
No.

362
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,180
They're horrible.

363
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,180
But, you know, for people who never go, it's good to go.

364
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,180
Once and good.

365
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,180
Yeah, that's true.

366
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,180
Right.

367
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,180
So that's why I'm not going to do a show.

368
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,180
I'm totally unplugging.

369
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,180
Yeah.

370
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,180
And I really want to enjoy it.

371
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
I'm very busy.

372
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,180
I'm going to do...

373
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,180
Then you're going to be gone for a week, aren't you?

374
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,180
You're doing a photo shoot for a glossy magazine?

375
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,180
I have another TV show to do.

376
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,180
And I have two days of photo shoot.

377
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,180
I think a couple of pages we have to do and a big interview.

378
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,180

379
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,180

00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,180
So, it's going to be very nice.

381
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
Yeah.

382
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,180
All right.

383
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,180
Can you tell me what you're going to do?

384
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,180
Is it the theme or is it naked?

385
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,180
I might show myself.

386
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,180
No, really?

387
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,180
No, you're kidding me.

388
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,180
I don't know.

389
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,180
You're not really going to do that already.

390
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,180
Maybe.

391
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
Maybe.

392
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,180
You're kidding me.

393
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,180
It's all about...

394
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,180
What are you going to show?

395
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,180
I don't know yet.

396
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,180

397
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,180
Wait a minute.

398
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,180
This is not being discussed with me.

399
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,180
I didn't know you're going to...

400
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,180
You're not going to do naked pictures already?

401
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
No.

402
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
You said I'm maybe going to show myself.

403
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,180
No.

404
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,180
No, no.

405
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,180
It's going to be very sexy.

406
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,180
Yeah.

407
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,180

408
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
Very glamour.

409
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,180

00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,180
I know.

412
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,180
They steal my idea.

413
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180

414
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,180

415
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,180
Stop listening.

416
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,180
I'll be honest.

417
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,180
You stealing her idea.

418
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,180
But it's all about girls over 50.

419
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,180
Okay.

420
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,180
It's a new 30.

421
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,180
And it's a girl's under 60.

422

00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,180
No.

424
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,180
Girls over 50.

00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,180
And horny is hell.

426
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,180
Sort of.

427
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,180
You know?

428
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,180
Because it's not over yet.

429
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
No.

430
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,180
We're starting.

431
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,180
It's beginning.

432
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,180
Really?

433
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,180
It's a new journey.

434
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,180
Yeah.

435
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,180
And who's going to satisfy all your needs for this new frickin journey you're embarking on?

I think we're getting it back.

439
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,180
The girls are getting it back over 50.

440
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,180
Oh, man.

441
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,180
I really don't know what you're just just going to be doing.

442
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,180
Well, I'm gone.

443
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,180
I don't trust it.

444
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,180
No.

445
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,180
You shouldn't.

446
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180
Shit, man.

447
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,180

We got it.

449
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,180
We got to stop.

450
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,180
Another song I wanted to listen to before we leave.

451
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
Okay.

452
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,180

Hold on.

457
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,180

00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:36,180
He writes his own music and lyrics, performs all the instruments, and synthesizes the sounds.

461
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,180
Can I have his telephone number?
