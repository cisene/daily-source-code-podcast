1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
That's the challenge from here on out when you go on vacation, you got a lot of damage

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,820
control to do.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,820
Sorry.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,820
Clear prop.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,180
Delta, Sierra Turm.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,180
5, 86.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,540
16 billion dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:31,540
We're in the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:37,660
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,380
At a monkey with nightmare, I'll talk to you guys for a bit more time, so that's

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,380
a bad thing.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,940
I mean, it's just giving you a kill right into the ground, I'm tired of it, but it's

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,300
a bit disappointed.

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:55,560
It starts like a whirlwind, thinking that you'd go for it, making lots of time, and

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,540
you're pimped down thin, then you want to ride a song, and working on it long, and

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:09,040
tweak it, mix it down, and get me free, but then it comes a word from the man, he was

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,720
to slap a little steak on your plan, just be little words, don't you know it to work,

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,720
anymore?

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:25,160
We want it to, and like we want it to, and play it when we want it to, and bring it

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,680
up to everyone can see, and you can't lock it down, and you can never budge down, and shout

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,880
it up, and sell the music free.

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,200
I've got it in my pocket, I've even went and bought it, I did this deal, and you know

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,680
I never would, I never would, but I said don't make it look like, just another

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,680
crew, cause I'm doing what you said that I should do, so take a deep breath now my friend,

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:02,680
take your first step, and walk right in, to 21st century, and welcome to the way it's

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
gonna be.

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:11,680
We want it to, and like we want it to, and play it when we want it to, and bring it up

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,680
to everyone can see, and you can't lock it down, and you can never budge down, shout

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,680
it up, and sell the music free.

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:30,680
I can't see you, to anything, to anything, to anything else that I would want you

31
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,680
to, and you can't lock it down, and you can't lock it down, and you can't lock it down,

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,680
and you can't lock it down, just shut it down, and set the music free.

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,680
set the musicfryin', set the music, rent, and so on.

47
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
when you hear those...

48
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,680
I'm shuffing music, I hope you're cooking!

49
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,680
And the lyrics, you know, it's got to be at Jeff Smith brand new and available

50
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
on the pot wave music, now where we're, set the music free.

51
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Hey everybody, how you doin'?

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Welcome to the Daily, source code episode number 586, coming to you just briefly,

53
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,680
just for one day from the Curry manor, in the affluent, subρε entrenonn district,

54
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,760
in the affluent suburb of serenones gulfard here in Adams attic yes the

55
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,880
south of the savants at your service hey back from vacation tomorrow i take off

56
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:22,120
immediately to uh San Francisco for the rest of the week i would have gone uh uh

57
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,640
Sunday which is actually we arrived late last night or actually early this morning

58
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:32,360
calling uh sorry i actually didn't want to hear you that was really nasty um

59
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,040
we arrived late last night from our uh from our eight days in the sun in ten

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,840
and reef which i never been to before very nice i have to say uh it was on a scale of

61
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,800
one to ten i'd say it was an eight and a half uh at times close to a nine of course uh

62
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,200
there were some crappy moments as well where the uh the headphone earlobe infection uh

63
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:57,720
definitely uh worsened and so i was at Tuesday or Wednesday uh i think it was

64
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,000
i don't remember now yeah Tuesday had the doctor come and uh i don't know if you were

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,840
following along on the uncurry dot com or the web on the web log uh i was posting

66
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,680
a lot of flicker pictures as well from my uh from my E61 i which uh just a fantastic device i

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,440
really enjoyed using it um not being paid to say that by the way i'm such an idiot but then

68
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:26,680
again i really like it so much um uh so uh yeah i had to order a doctor and uh you know i'm

69
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,440
laying there and you know my earlobe is really thick and it's starting to pound a little bit

70
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,600
and i've been through this before and they basically have to cut it open you know squeeze all this

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,640
crap out of it and uh i'm not got the door like okay here's the doctor you know i don't speak

72
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,400
any Spanish except for a year but boina that's about it and i knew how to ask for them photo but you know

73
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,320
and in walks a uh a young woman uh turns out uh 27 year old doctor from pole and who'd been

74
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,720
living there for two years uh she said she just came to the island for adventure but she really

75
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,000
wanted to go back to pole and we had a nice little chat and she looked at my aunt she said well

76
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,560
i think it's too early to cut i don't think we should do that uh you know it could cause

77
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,760
more problems than it could solve like what the hell does that mean and she put me on some

78
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,840
any biotics like really heavy shit like 875 milligrams of moxasilin or whatever and it's like

79
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,600
just a hum and you can feel the shit coursing throughout your veins so uh waited for 48 hours

80
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,080
uh it only got worse i was waking up at five in the morning my ear really really

81
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,280
hurting and so you know it was just the skin was all it really it was like the size of a big marble it

82
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:39,640
was disgusting uh so uh agatha's her name she came by uh uh was i think was Thursday and i said okay

83
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,640
look please just cut me she said yep got a cut you i said your place remind baby she said

84
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,040
my place but you can't ride with me because you know it she doesn't have any insurance for that or

85
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:54,120
whatever uh so i had to go over to the clinic met her there and uh she was great she was joking around

86
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,560
with me she's like okay uh what how big a knife do you and she spoke this really cute with

87
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,800
English with like a Polish kind of Spanish accent it was really weird how big the knife do you want

88
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,280
anyway so uh she had like some some guy off the street i think no he was an ambulance driver

89
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,800
hold my hair up while i'm laying face down uh she can't you can't anesthesize the the earlobe

90
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,000
they can only spray like some cold stuff on it so it kind of feels like uh it's numb because it's

91
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,160
basically freezing off uh and that she was cutting and squeezing and uh and unfortunately i didn't

92
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,440
i if i'd known what was gonna happen if uh if i'd actually if i was able to find Christina

93
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,480
would have asked her to come along and film it so unfortunately no video of the actual event

94
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,680
so now that's why my headphone is uh uh is producing feedback is because i have to put the

95
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,080
it literally is from the headphone because now i feel that the cushion on the headphone is rubbing

96
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,520
against the actual area the god infected so the headphone earlobe it's true it's what it's what this

97
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,840
whole thing is from and why i've had it now in the past uh twice at least with the exact same results

98
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,680
unfortunately something stuck on my throat maybe something markio shemodonem cough left

99
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,040
by the way i got about equal love and equal hate armna on mark filling in on the show interesting

100
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,480
um i didn't listen to all of them i did listen to the comic strip blogger segment which uh

101
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,720
it made me laugh out loud many many times but uh it wasn't uh wasn't really daily source

102
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,640
going material but i really appreciate mark filling in and uh pushing uh pushing the envelope so we

103
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,360
we know where the limits lie with with this audience at least and it was very interesting to uh

104
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:45,320
to read a lot of the feedback yeah okay so um yeah it's anyway great vacation how to great time

105
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,880
a little bit of a a panic last night you know our our visas our temporary visas have expired

106
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,040
and our permanent visas are in the in the in the works of the home office so after you know

107
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,320
produce all this paperwork in order to be led into the country uh you know it takes about 10

108
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,200
15 minutes at at customs and so we were last to get our bags and this is 130 in the morning

109
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,720
and uh so i see my bag and you know it's the one of the last ones and i pick it up and

110
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,640
it's the it's a big to me roller bag and it's got a gold card and it's got the uh the to me leather

111
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,400
um address you know tag and then i and i'm looking at it and it's my bag right but i say wow that's

112
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,960
interesting because the TSA cut my lock off how come there's a lock on my bag this is the original

113
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,600
lock that came with the bag and i'm like confused it Patricia put that on and then i start to see

114
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,280
subtle nuances uh the gold card that was uh was attached to the handle was for British airways and

115
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,320
not for Virgin and i'm like oh crap here it is one third in the morning we're the last ones

116
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,480
off the plane everyone else has their baggage someone's taken my bag obviously mistaken it very easy

117
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,000
to do by the way so like oh hey i got i got lucky i went over to the uh to the baggage department

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,320
the guy had actually realized it before he left the airport he had already gone through uh through

119
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,480
uh customs and all that stuff so he was waiting on the other side but i mean what are the chances

120
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,000
of two bags and the almost exactly the same configuration uh from the same flight from tender

121
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,520
reef so i was waving my arms like a fucking maniac i was so pissed off you know i was telling

122
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:21,400
about the E61 um i used it in many different ways uh of course line at the pool i could actually

123
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,240
reach a wireless access point which was really nice so i was downloading podcasts and what i did

124
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:35,000
this was an interesting little uh experiment that i tried um i used the the podcasting application

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,320
on the on the E61 i uh to download all the shows i wanted to listen to and then i access them

126
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,200
through the N800 with my headphones on through bluetooth there was literally streaming from the

127
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,920
memory card on the E61 i through the air through bluetooth into the N800 which has a nice stereo sound

128
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,040
that has the regular you know you know has regular headphone jack so you can just you know uh put

129
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,960
little ear buds in and it would it work i was just amazed the interoperability of the devices

130
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:16,040
was fantastic but uh just having this E61 i sparked off a lot of comments out of the E61 i

131
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,680
come out ever since it was in it's back in February i realized yesterday it just started shipping

132
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,800
in part to Europe and i've been reloading aid advances to hit they've got any in it you've already

133
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,880
got one you're so in so i can't wait to get mine at earlier if i'm really jumping at the bit

134
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,120
i've got a palm hand that was dying on its ass and i can't wait to count it and switch over to

135
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,880
Nokia stop carrying two devices anyway best of luck i'm really waiting for mine yeah man

136
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,160
yeah that E61 and i is something special i got to tell you um the the whole the way the whole thing

137
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,680
works it's it's such a it really is a big upgrade from the E61 which i had to give to Christina

138
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:02,840
because misthing lost her phone somewhere so we had to go through the whole hassle of uh you know

139
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,160
putting a temporary block on the account i still don't think they've they sent us a new sim card

140
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,000
to don't think it's been activated yet um and yeah like i've already bought her a million phones

141
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,160
and so i have a perfectly good phone to say he used this one she said but it's really manly say

142
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,960
you know tough shit don't lose your phone you know use the money you from working on weekends to go

143
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:29,400

160
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,560
read some good books um thought about uh yeah a lot of things of course is what you do on vacation

161
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,680
it's been a year since we've been away and i think it's time to start changing the format a little bit

162
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,040
of the daily source code now i'm it's gonna be interesting because with every format change it's

163
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,000
all experimentation and just trying to figure stuff out and it's kind of you know just at the

164
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,520
almost a day before mark called comic strip blogger i was thinking you know what can i actually

165
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:51,480
was in combination with the i miss because of course i miss got uh got uh canceled i should say

166
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:58,360
fired slash canceled i don't have to rehash the story um now i was thinking idiot okay here's

167
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,400
what was interesting about it is even though there was a lot of uh you know like Howard Stern type

168
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:11,480
stuff um then of course uh there was then i want to take the napy headed home comment uh this is

169
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,320
really a program where a lot of um policy makers decision people decision makers it really interesting

170
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,800
people i would say would call in uh regularly to discuss uh current events and it turns out that you know

171
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,080
Washington really listened to don i miss i didn't know that and i'm not really an i miss listener to

172
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,640
be honest uh and now of course i'm like shit you know maybe i should have listened to him a little bit more

173
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,080
i have a it was always like maybe that's because uh he uh Stern always put him down and i say well

174
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,240
this guy's got to be dick it's got to be a loser show i shouldn't listen to it but now i'm kind of

175
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,800
bummed out because uh you probably had a really interesting show and just didn't know about it all these years

176
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:56,360
um i think and you know why can't we you know have fun and you know fart and burp and

177
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,480
and talk about naked pictures but also um have some really interesting people on and uh you know

178
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,280
i am of course the sultan of the savance and i i have a lot of uh people with a lot of knowledge

179
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:12,440
at my fingertips literally if not maybe two phone calls away i could get almost anybody i want to

180
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,720
really i'm convinced of it you know but we have to build it up and i'd like to talk to other people

181
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,760
who know something about stuff you know and not just the same old uh polished media types who

182
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,160
talk in beautiful soundbites and appear on all of these new shows you know we've got you guys first

183
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,160
of all um so i'm thinking you know i'd love to talk about uh uh financial i'd love to talk

184
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,640
about the world bank with the nylon right i'm sure that nylon knows a lot about the well

185
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,880
i'm how does the fucking world bank work what is it what does it do what you know what's up

186
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,160
with Paul Wolfowitz i'm not getting any of this information from mainstream media uh yeah you know

187
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,080
bits and pieces of it and of course i do know what the world bank does but you know i know

188
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,520
Patricia doesn't know Christina doesn't i don't think they care and if there was someone

189
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:00,120
interesting compelling who's already you know in the audience or friend of the show or just a savance

190
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:07,560
in general and preferably someone who has a speech impediment or hates me or you know the normal

191
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,600
people right let's just have human beings who who happen to know a lot of stuff talk about it

192
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,880
and i also thought well maybe uh there's a lot going on still with uh you know with Korea

193
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,040
and uh just with the uh the administration are you as the administration in general i thought

194
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,000
yeah maybe should call uncle Don i just want to do some phone calls uh or Skype calls or

195
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,400
whatever they're going to be so um i figured i'd start off uh since um uh commentary bloggers first

196
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,800
appearance on the daily source code in a live environment um it was not the first experience i

197
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:48,120
would have wanted him to have again i had the laugh that was into the to the the conversation

198
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:55,080
mark and uh CSB had uh figure you know why don't want to i have him be the first guy to kick off this

199
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:03,000
new format uh because i know it'll be difficult uh to uh to aid understand them probably uh b uh he

200
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,800
he may have his own agenda um and but you know i think he does know a lot about uh european union affairs

201
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,640
and there's some stuff i want to talk about in that regard and y'all so uh of course knows a lot

202
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,720
about uh mobile phones or at least he says he does so uh to start off uh the first of our series

203
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:27,240
of uh savon specials and i hope to be able to talk to a savon every single day uh it's gonna

204
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,520
take some production but again you know i'm um changing the format and morphing stuff it just takes

205
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,520
time it's also probably gonna run a little bit longer than usual but remember there's a fast

206
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:43,480
forward button on there for for a reason so um anyway uh comics are blogger was nice enough to uh

207
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,800
hang with me uh this evening so that we can talk about a couple of things in our first in the savon

208
00:18:47,800 --> 00:19:01,960
series comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip that's right the very

209
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:08,680
first savon to be on the show csb how you doing my friend and finally then it's Sunday

210
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:15,640
evening and i'm going to sleep soon well before you go to sleep uh csb uh i want to uh ask you a

211
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,800
couple of questions because there's been a lot of uh new stories that i was following uh during

212
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:27,960
my vacation of course i had my uh my uh Nokia e61i uh in my pocket at all times and i was uh

213
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:35,560
reading news and uh and mucking around a bit and uh the big thing that a couple of big stories

214
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,200
first one was about uh the people who manage the and i didn't know that this was a central resource

215
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,920
the people who manage email that goes to blackberries uh company called rim they had a a huge

216
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,920
outage and um well there's a couple of things about the first of all i i think the uh the mainstream

217
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,080
media just kind of like glossed over it i mean for for any servers to be down for or is it uh 18 hours

218
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,720
or something like that i think is a really big deal particularly when it comes to uh to the blackberry

219
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,520
service because uh governments use it and uh lots of people i know use it and i was wondering if uh

220
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,440
if you had any idea you know they say it was like some cash flow problem uh you know no no no so

221
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:25,400
i have met the CEO so i have seen CEO i was participating in the session of the CEO of rim

222
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,440
and remit's a cake Canadian company that it's not only running the blackberry service but they

223
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,040
are also producing and licensing blackberry devices and software for smartphones for blackberry

224
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:42,920
okay so so you met the CEO always that were you said yes this is Balcille Balcille and he is

225
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,760
bald he is no hair and and very arrogant it was very arrogant and i think this uh arrogant way

226
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,520
of uh rim it's reflecting also how they handle the customers during this outage for example uh

227
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,760
they have not published and noticed but they just were quiet about the situation and at the end

228
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,680
they have said that okay the situation is clear now so so if you are not receiving email in your

229
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,080
blackberry for some day and you go to the website of blackberry there's no information about

230
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,520
outage so you know this is let's say such arrogant but behavior and this is caused by the fact

231
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:27,080
that uh blackberry so this corporation research in motion is is the abbreviation and they they are

232
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,640
simply they have simply such strong market position that they totally are arrogant through

233
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,120
its customers and they have some competition but it's competition is quite distributed and they

234
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:42,440
are quite focused and i think the problem was simply shitty software they have of course it was

235
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,280
they have updated the software to the new version and during the the change they have simply

236
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:55,880
they backup was not working and uh not professional shitty software during update okay okay so

237
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:03,240
hold on a second see us be okay so the CEO is not only is he arrogant but he's also bald on top of

238
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:10,520
all that okay he has no hair but is he responsible for this isn't there CEO or someone else who

239
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,800
I don't think so I don't think that there will be a putting some responsibility to anybody that

240
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:22,280
they will just say that it was shot outage and nobody will be responsible for that they as they

241
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:31,160
had very strong market position and practically specifically in this push email market they are

242
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,920
market leaders and okay so do you think this is a bad thing is I mean you can license their

243
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,640
technology I guess can't you no but they say that this is one off this is one off and they will

244
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,040
never every again and no problem okay but but we all know of course something like that is

245
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,640
bound to happen again they're they're selling what a million blackberries a month there's some

246
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,440
some crazy number like that it's in in total they have something like 10 million customers I'm

247
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,120
but it could keep you mind that apart from the blackberry devices you can install this blackberry

248
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,680
connects software also in your smartphone so on in this smartphone for almost except for a

249
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,680
will it work on a Nokia no you can't put that on a Nokia can you it should work in a Nokia I

250
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,040
was talking with Nokia and both in one of the trade shows and they told me that the Nokia

251
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,240
E61 series that they're supporting all push email standards are really so good technology on

252
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,880
blackberry oh okay that's pretty cool if you continue this shit properly it should work

253
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,280
of course remember remember the blackberry services connected with your mobile operator so why

254
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,080
that's curious there is so in this way you have to contact your mobile operator you cannot do it on yourself

255
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,880
CSB you were just such a platter association in information well I love hearing all the

256
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,200
stuff you know about it so incidentally because I'm going to this mobile phone trade shows and

257
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:51,160
another patients and I'm looking meeting some as close and who are you meeting?

258
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:59,240
It is managers and other stuff for example I have seen him in the session this guy from

259
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,840
from room in in Spain in Barcelona at the GSM and I have seen him talking that

260
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:11,240
whatever we have our devices we have blackberry connect software here it is from my

261
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:18,120
point of view this mobile operating systems but we don't care okay so personally about blackberry

262
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,800
I could talk about a lot but generally speaking you cannot run native software in blackberry so

263
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,680
you can run on Java applications so it doesn't really mean that we in comparison to smartphones

264
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:34,120
like Symbian or like Windows Mobile where you can launch any application also like very complex

265
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:40,040
gigabyte applications for navigation and stuff right so you think that it's that there's going to

266
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,480
be more out of just from rim this is what you predict you think and could they do?

267
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,840
No no I think that they now they have learned the lesson and now they will do more testing

268
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,080
and in future upgrades there will simply say they will be claiming that it was one off and

269
00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:01,640
it will never repeat again but just philosophically CSB to have now 30 million but in a couple

270
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,400
years it could be double that number to have 40 50 60 million people depend on one company for

271
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,160
their lifeline of communications isn't that isn't there a better way of doing that?

272
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,240
Fuck you I don't care you don't have this thing that's in the communication

273
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:22,120
special scalable solutions and they can handle setting me on without problems okay

274
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,960
Alright let's move on to another question I had for you this is something that we've been talking about

275
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,040
on daily source code for a while about roaming charges particularly in the EU and I came across

276
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,080
the story in the Wall Street Journal is came out in April 13th

277
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,680
I don't know one thing some Esco is checking out maybe he wants you baby

278
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:50,520
Alright well so let me just read the part of this new story so

279
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,920
a proposal to cap roaming charges from mobile phone calls in the European Union

280
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,600
created an important hurdle with when a key committee of the European Parliament voted for it

281
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,400
I would have to bullshit so much let me tell it started okay let me just say one thing

282
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,120
let me bullshit a little bit more you know Patricia has a has a virgin mobile

283
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,480
account and they were charging her to call outside just to call back to the UK from Tenerife

284
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:25,400
one pound and 50 pens per minute just to call out and it was one pound if she received a call

285
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:34,440
okay this is crazy so this is crazy to the extent but obviously these are different countries

286
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,200
and the mobile operators are like vampires the stacking blood of customers but you look

287
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:47,000
the situation is such that there is new EU directives on new law that EU government is saying

288
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,760
Esco's bus stats mobile operators used to reduce roaming fees and I agree I think the

289
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,600
of the mobile operators by definition are bastards no no you are saying this to the mobile

290
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,040
operators and the mobile operators will increase roaming fees to such Esco's like yourself

291
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,800
who are coming from USA the European directed this has to be lowered then what do you mean

292
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:16,200
they're going to charge me more because they will finance this 70% reduction of the fee

293
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,200
by judging more people who are coming from outside of the EU okay but all right

294
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:28,120
okay so to the the EU customers won't get penalized but people who have accounts from outside

295
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,800
the EU will be penalized is that what you're saying yes and the apart from that keeping mind that

296
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:41,240
there are already mobile operators that are agile and offering for example if you go

297
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,840
there is operator three in UK you have heard about three operators yeah of course yeah

298
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,840
and this is a quite new one this is owned by Asian company Hachison and

299
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,280
sort of speaking all breeds of Asian origin are buying the three because they are

300
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:06,200
Asian also so anyway that with three if you have a three a cart and you are going to Australia

301
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,320
Austria Hong Kong Denmark Ireland Italy also with them and you are receiving a phone call you don't

302
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,680
pay anything right well this is but this is my point this is the way it should be I mean

303
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,760
voter phones network in the UK is gotta be the same voter phone network in Spain except

304
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,920
if you actually go to Spain you're still using voter phones network but you get charged all these

305
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:32,120
roaming fees so that is now going to go away effectively or it's going to be there at all but it shouldn't

306
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,080
be there at all it's the same network is there on network isn't it? Adam this big bastards like

307
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,080
what a phone team are they are too big that too arrogant to reduce it to the zero and they have no

308
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:49,400
hair probably too right if they're arrogant that they will reduce only 70% and only such small

309
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:56,040
operator like three but it it three has divisions in Australia in Austria Hong Kong Ireland

310
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,080
if you go to Australia with three SIM card you receive phone call and you make phone calls to British

311
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:09,080
numbers without NFC okay okay fantastic now yeah understand I understand but they don't want to do it

312
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:16,120
okay so what is the solution to the and and we haven't even talked about data I mean you pay like

313
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:22,600
a pound per megabyte downloaded when you're roaming which is another thing it just kills me the

314
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,840
amount of that is being paid for data traffic does this directive address that at all?

315
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,520
No it is only about phone calls I remember about data there are some operators that are addressing

316
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,320
this issue for example in case of voter phone what are phone calls special plans that when you go

317
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,960
Spain we do what that phone SIM card from UK then you can pay the similar of the very similar price as

318
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:50,360
in UK right okay let me let me let me let me ask you this let me ask you this just for my own

319
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:59,960
own personal benefit what is the best operator for me knowing that I spend about half my time

320
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:06,120
in the United States and I spend half my time or yeah let's say 40% in the United States 40% in the

321
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:15,960
UK and another 20% in different countries in Europe like the Netherlands what will be the most

322
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:22,920
cost effective for me not just for calls but also mainly for data because I really need the data

323
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:30,760
connection no no your situation is fact that all right hold on a second we'll be right back

324
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:40,360
with more from comic strip blogger music and making good one uplifting song and one uplifting

325
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:49,480
story in the news she told me she told me she told me she told me she told me she told me she told me

326
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,480
you

327
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,860
unfortunately okay fortunately what're they're foking ever all right

328
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,920
something another country is to whatever just one more thing about mobile phones CSB

329
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:24,040
be both Motorola and Nokia reported their financial numbers, the quarterly numbers, Motorola

330
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:31,120
had a huge loss, like over a hundred million dollar or euro loss, can't remember.

331
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,440
And Nokia, who is still profitable, made a lot less profit.

332
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,640
What's happening?

333
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,580
So I also have met this ESCO's during TGSM and the third show, and to extend their

334
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,580
short, the bald guy without hair, who's the he who's he?

335
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,580
Exender is a CR of Motorola, right, okay, he's also an arrogant guy.

336
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,580
And no, no, look, in the sense, look, they have big success with Motorola Razor, you know?

337
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,580
Yeah.

338
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:07,580
And this Motorola Razor was a success, and then instead of innovating and diversifying the portfolio

339
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:13,580
in mobile phones, they're just waiting out the news, the speed images of the Motorola Razor.

340
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:20,580
And this way, in this way, in this way, and that, you know, Motorola, that's way, you know?

341
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,580
Wait, wait, what are you saying?

342
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,580
What are you saying?

343
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,580
Are they good or no good?

344
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,580
In what sense, you're going to generalize over simplifying things?

345
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,580
What sense?

346
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:36,580
Well, are they making products that people want and do they know how to make them profitably?

347
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,580
No, the situation with Motorola is such that they first ideas are good, and they are

348
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,580
getting up in the next generation of products.

349
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,580
That can give several examples.

350
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,580
For example, in the case of Motorola Razor, the next Motorola Razor was thicker.

351
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,580
And in the case of Motorola Q Smartphone, it has wheel.

352
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,580
But Motorola Q, next generation, it has no wheel.

353
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,580
But it has HDPAs.

354
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,580
So there's no wheel.

355
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
Well, it has no wheel.

356
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,580
What is that?

357
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,580
Wheel.

358
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,580
In the score wheel.

359
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,580
Oh, wheel.

360
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,580
Okay, wheel.

361
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,580
Okay.

362
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,580
He was smart for most very popular in USA.

363
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:14,580
And even Steve Faking Jobs was showing it as the one of phones from the competition.

364
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,580
And it was a very good phone.

365
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,580
But Motorola has not released GSM HDPA version fast enough.

366
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,580
And when they release it, it has no screw wheel.

367
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,580
So that was a big mistake.

368
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,580
That was a big mistake.

369
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,580
The no screw wheel.

370
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,580
Yes.

371
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,580
And also this big mistake.

372
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,580
And also, you know, simply competition is rising too fast.

373
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,580
And I mean my career in France from LG and Samsung.

374
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,580
And also knock-and-boost knock-ah.

375
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,580
They knock-ah has new CEO.

376
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,580
His name is Oli Peca Calvalsau.

377
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:50,580
And he placed your Maulida who was very, very long time in the CEO of knock-ah.

378
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,580
No, you're not a big fan of knock-ah, right?

379
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,580
Yes, they are bastards.

380
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,580
Who do you like?

381
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,580
Is it only Windows mobile that you like?

382
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,580
I like Motorola, but no, the problem is with Motorola.

383
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,580
They are not consequent and not fast enough with the actions.

384
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,580
I got it.

385
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,580
How about Nokia?

386
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,580
Because I got to tell you CSB, this E61I.

387
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,580
I use this for a week.

388
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,580
I didn't use any other device.

389
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,580
And it really right down to the built-in wayfinder GPS.

390
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,580
You know, and it goes out and brings in the maps through the data connection.

391
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
It could find me immediately.

392
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:37,580
I installed, was it Shouzu when I could geo and code the information into my pictures.

393
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:44,580
Obviously, phone calls, no problem, the data connection, the Wi-Fi, the podcasting application.

394
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:49,580
Really, it really was a very enjoyable experience.

395
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,580
I think that this phone, they've got to hit with this phone.

396
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,580
I think it's fantastic.

397
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,580
Okay, I know that you have to buy a knock-ah button.

398
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,580
I'm, you know, they send me free shit.

399
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,580
Look, you know, I'll try any free shit, obviously.

400
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:09,580
Nokia has, there are two reasons why Nokia has, so actually three reasons why Nokia has such big success.

401
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,580
And it's number one in mobile phone industry.

402
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,580
It is also related to business.

403
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:18,580
And there is a number one is that they have very, there's been a lot of money on marketing.

404
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,580
And actually there are Eastern European countries,

405
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,580
but they're in with Russia, formerly Soviet Russian Republic.

406
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:29,580
But they have create image that this phones are coming actually from Japan.

407
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,580
So this is the first reason.

408
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,580
The second reason.

409
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,580
Okay, I don't give a shit where they're made.

410
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,580
It's a good phone.

411
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,580
The marketing for me doesn't make any difference.

412
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,580
I'm using the device and I'm liking it.

413
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,580
Doing what I want the device to do.

414
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,580
But the point, this is the fact that they have a very good marketing.

415
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,580
A lot of money spending on marketing and a very clever marketing.

416
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,580
It's confusing.

417
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:56,580
For example, they're putting high resolution images in the shitty resolution display

418
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,580
and giving you different impressions.

419
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,580
But okay, the second one is now, what are you talking about?

420
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,580
It's two megapixel cameras.

421
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,580
It's nothing super, but it's okay.

422
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,580
I mean, you're telling me that their marketing is confusing me, but it's not.

423
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,580
I'm using the phone and I like it.

424
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,580
It has nothing.

425
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,580
I'm already past the marketing.

426
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
Okay.

427
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,580
The second reason is big diversity.

428
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,580
The second hidden secret, big diversity.

429
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,580
So they are offering phones for every asshole.

430
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,580
They have phones.

431
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,580
They look like blackberry.

432
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,580
They look like...

433
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,580
My phone.

434
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,580
I got to tell you.

435
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:37,580
I gave Patricia the really hit pink one that kind of slides open.

436
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,580
I forgot which model number it is.

437
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,580
Yeah, it's a Nokia.

438
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,580
It's like it's not all the fashion magazine.

439
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,580
Okay, so there's a case in point about the great marketing.

440
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,580
But she loves the phone.

441
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,580
It just really works.

442
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,580
She understands it.

443
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,580
I think you got admitted just making good products.

444
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,580
So this is diversity.

445
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,580
And the third secret of sexism.

446
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,580
When they have that line for releasing the phone,

447
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,580
they release it no matter what,

448
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,580
even if they have to cut on features.

449
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,580
And in case of Motorola,

450
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,580
this is a point.

451
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,580
For example, the sexes of the Moto Latius,

452
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:17,580
smartphone was released with one year delay or six months delay.

453
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,580
So this is execution.

454
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,580
And they deliver no matter what.

455
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,580
Okay.

456
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,580
So the Nokia is not...

457
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,580
There are reasons why Nokia is good,

458
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,580
but in the phones.

459
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,580
But you should understand that the symbioness,

460
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,580
power in your phone,

461
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,580
is not really open operating system.

462
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,580
This is a cartel of Nokia,

463
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,580
or something like that.

464
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
Yeah, but CBSB.

465
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,580
I don't give a shit if there's a cartel.

466
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,580
I don't care if there's a cartel.

467
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,580
As long as they put the camera in the phone and make your work,

468
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,580
as long as they make the speaker phone work.

469
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,580
I don't mind a cartel.

470
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,580
I don't want to have to...

471
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,580
There's nothing missing from these devices

472
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,580
that I need someone to develop for it.

473
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,580
It's all kind of work, and I like it.

474
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,580
And speaking of Nokia, as you said,

475
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,580
if it has had loss,

476
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,580
but Nokia has still profit,

477
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,580
but the profit margin of Nokia is going down,

478
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,580
because most of the phones that are selling their cheap phones,

479
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,580
and Nokia would like to sell more expensive phones

480
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,580
like the one that you got.

481
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,580
And shortly speaking,

482
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,580
apart from mobile phones,

483
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,580
Nokia 25% or 30% of business of Nokia

484
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,580
also net mobile networks,

485
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,580
and Nokia is managing with Zimans

486
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,580
in the network series, for example.

487
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,580
And this could be also the reason why they don't have

488
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,580
such an excellent profits.

489
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,580
Interesting thing is that Zimans

490
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,580
may not just involve in Canada's enjoyment

491
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,580
because of some corruption or whatever,

492
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,580
but it doesn't disturb Nokia going forward.

493
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,580
Yeah, I think you're right.

494
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,580
They've got good products.

495
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,580
They have a diverse line of products.

496
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,580
And they understand their business.

497
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,580
So now, how come you hate them?

498
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,580
That's another reason.

499
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:08,580
Would you care to tell the Charlie listeners about that?

500
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:17,580
Because, no, I'm afraid behavior

501
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,580
that they should say short towards myself.

502
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:27,580
And personally, I know that they have,

503
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,580
you know, this is a small country, Finland.

504
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,580
And in this country, if you are a lawyer,

505
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,580
and Nokia is saying something,

506
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,580
you kind of have no chances to sort of Nokia, for example.

507
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,580
Okay.

508
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,580
So there's some kind of dispute that you had, which...

509
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,580
I'm interested in smartphone markets.

510
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,580
So generally, these phones of the higher end phones.

511
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,580
And in this market, the practices of Nokia,

512
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,580
with Zimian, where they're pushing this Zimian operating system.

513
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,580
For example, this funder of Zimian was a British company called PSEON.

514
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:08,580
And PSEON wanted to float this company on the stock market,

515
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,580
but Nokia said, no, because you want to keep control.

516
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,580
Nokia has 50% of it.

517
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,580
Okay.

518
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,580
It's pretending that this is actually open industry initiative.

519
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,580
Well, of course it's not.

520
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,580
Okay.

521
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,580
Let me just ask you one final question.

522
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,580
I really want to stop about the mobile phone industry.

523
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,580
The hell was I going to ask you about?

524
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,580
Oh, yeah.

525
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,580
In all this time that we've known UCSB,

526
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,580
I still don't really know what you do.

527
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,580
Could you just tell me what your vocation is?

528
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,580
How do you make a living?

529
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,580
I'm software developer.

530
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,580
And I was really...

531
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,580
I was working at Nokia in Finland 3S,

532
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,580
and they fired me because of blogging.

533
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,580
Really?

534
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,580
Oh, okay.

535
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,580
Now this is interesting.

536
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,580
So they fired you because of your blogging,

537
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,580
but you're a software developer.

538
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,580
So you are a prolific programmer.

539
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,580
And designer, yes.

540
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,580
Really?

541
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,580
Okay.

542
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,580
What platform?

543
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,580
Adam.

544
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,580
And the price software.

545
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,580
I wouldn't like to talk to my she.

546
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,580
I like that man.

547
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,580
Come on.

548
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,580
I really want to know more.

549
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,580
What do you...

550
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,580
What do you program for?

551
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,580
Symbian or do you program?

552
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,580
I don't know more.

553
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,580
But another society people want to know more.

554
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,580
We'll be right back with one more segment

555
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,580
with comic strip blogger.

556
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,580
Okay.

557
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,580
So I see that Splendon Fultures is no longer

558
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580
advertiser for Pacho.

559
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,580
Well, I guess I'll go back to my old coffee

560
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,580
and...

561
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,580
Well, there's some about this tonal pm.

562
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,580
And since I've ran out of Splendon,

563
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,580
I guess we're supposed to use the tonal pm.

564
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,580
And the coffee.

565
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,580
So...

566
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,580
Well, I'll give that a shot anyway.

567
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,580
And let's try it out and see what it tastes like.

568
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Okay.

569
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,580
Here goes.

570
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,580
Okay.

571
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,580
Well.

572
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,580
Not quite as sweet as I thought it'd be.

573
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,580
A little tart.

574
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,580
But I got it mida.

575
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,580
I liked it a lot.

576
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,580
And...

577
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:14,580
Hey Adam.

578
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,580
It's Steve Warner from Fidipidations.

579
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:35,580
The weekly Pacho podcast for runners at 1.pacho.com.

580
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:40,580
With a quick follow-up that I thought you'd appreciate.

581
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,580
And a big thank you to a lot of the folks back in the Pacho office

582
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,580
who went all out to help me in my running

583
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,580
of the 111st Boston Marathon.

584
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:55,580
Pacho made quite an appearance in this year's Boston Marathon

585
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,580
and I received a lot of great encouragement on the course

586
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:03,580
as I ran this race in a brutal, noriester.

587
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,580
Pacho!

588
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,580
Pacho!

589
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,580
Pacho!

590
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:16,580
Pacho!

591
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,580
Oh, thank you.

592
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,580
Thank you.

593
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,580
Oh, it's cold.

594
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,580
I'm going to eat it.

595
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,580
It's blown away.

596
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,580
Thank you.

597
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
Thank you.

598
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:36,580
Thank you.

599
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:41,580
You will.

600
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:45,580
Anyway, I just posted episode 93 of Fidipidations

601
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:49,580
where you can hear me run this 26.2 mile road race.

602
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,580
Check it out at run.pacho.com.

603
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,580
I'm already getting ready for a series of races.

604
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:00,580
I'll be running this summer with plans to run a couple of Marathons in the fall.

605
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,580
Thanks for all the support Adam.

606
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,580
I'm Steve runner and I've got to run.

607
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,580
Steve runner from Fidipidations podcast

608
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,580
who ran the Boston Marathon.

609
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,580
I love it that he had that T-shirt.

610
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,580
He had the Pacho T-shirt on and people are yelling.

611
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,580
Go, Pacho.

612
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,580
We probably could have put like cocksucker on it.

613
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,580
People were like, go, cocksucker.

614
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,580
They had no idea what they were talking about.

615
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:28,580
We've got comic strip blogger on the Skype for a portion of today's show.

616
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,580
Thank you.

617
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,580
I was going to ask you about the French elections,

618
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,580
but I guess it's kind of boring.

619
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,580
Actually, by the time people hear the show,

620
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,580
they live information that we don't know how the latest round went.

621
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,580
No, this is just the first round.

622
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,580
It's kind of like American idol, isn't it?

623
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:55,580
The way this works, I didn't know that the French have a very specific way of elections.

624
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,580
They have a...

625
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,580
It's almost like the Eurovision Song Contest.

626
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,580
They have a first round and then they have a second.

627
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,580
There's a third round or the second round is it?

628
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,580
No, the second round is the final round.

629
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,580
Generally speaking, in French elections,

630
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,580
everybody was looking at the first round

631
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,580
whether they would be surprised or not.

632
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,580
Because last time they were surprised.

633
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,580
Big surprise, because let's end,

634
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,580
which is right wing, X-ray means has won.

635
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,580
No.

636
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,580
But this time there was no surprise

637
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,580
and this two leading candidates,

638
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,580
the Sakozi and Riyal,

639
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,580
they have just moved to the next round.

640
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,580
But in Sakozi's leading now.

641
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,580
I like the Sakozi guy.

642
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,580
It looks like a nice guy.

643
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,580
Is he alright?

644
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,580
So, you know, I am myself a little bit right wing

645
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,580
and Riyal is a nice way.

646
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,580
He's left wing.

647
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,580
He's left wing.

648
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,580
Is that what you call them?

649
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,580
Bigger pattern?

650
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,580
What did you call them?

651
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,580
No, it's a clear school guy.

652
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,580
Okay.

653
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,580
Nobody's left wing.

654
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,580
His niece, Sakozi's left wing.

655
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,580
Sakozi is a right wing.

656
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

657
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,580
Riyal is left wing.

658
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,580
Okay, Riyal is left wing.

659
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,580
Okay, Riyal is left wing.

660
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,580
And Sakozi's channel is picking

661
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,580
wants to prevent Turkey joining you

662
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,580
and Riyal is saying,

663
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,580
what's she wishy wishy wishy wishy.

664
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,580
Well, wait a minute.

665
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,580
Shouldn't Turkey be allowed to join the EU?

666
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,580
Are you against that?

667
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:17,580
Personally, I would like to give it to the vote of people.

668
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,580
Right.

669
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,580
Because Turkey is huge.

670
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,580
Turkey used to be the middle of Europe.

671
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,580
Not really.

672
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,580
Yeah, yeah, Turkey was like Turkey was like the, like the the other

673
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,580
Rome.

674
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,580
Wasn't it?

675
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,580
No.

676
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,580
It was constant up.

677
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,580
Constantinople.

678
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,580
Constantinople was the second Rome.

679
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,580
Wasn't it?

680
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,580
Yeah.

681
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,580
Is in the continent where's Constantinople?

682
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,580
Where the hell was that?

683
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,580
It's between European, Pat Turkey and the Asian,

684
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,580
Pat.

685
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,580
Okay, so it's Turkey.

686
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,580
It's Turkey.

687
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:53,900
Right, all right, okay, but not middle of Europe. What the fuck are you talking about?

688
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,860
No, I don't know. No, it was like I didn't like the middle, but the center, you know, the economic center is what I meant.

689
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:06,540
The problem is that from the point of view of old societies in Europe that are aging and decreasing in

690
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:12,300
numbers apart from UK, which is growing, the Turkey is growing rapidly. It would be situation where

691
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:19,100
Turkey would have more vote than Germany in the European Parliament, and people are scared in

692
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:26,140
France, particularly because France has a very big minority of these Muslim people, that if Turkey

693
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:32,540
will join Europe, then they will simply overrun France. But you know, it looks.

694
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:39,100
Sarkozy is against it and Real is wishy-washy about it. And the vote on the next

695
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:43,820
in two weeks on 6th May, the second round will be the final round, and then we will vote about

696
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:49,500
Turkey in Europe. Shortest speaking. Okay. So what do you think? Will it happen or not? Will Turkey be able to join the EU?

697
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:56,140
I think yes, because Germans are pushing it. Okay. All right, just I one more thing for you, CSV.

698
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:02,700
You know, I had a problem with my earlobe when I was on vacation in Tenerife, and it was something

699
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:07,580
that it's this headphone earlobe, you know, because of the rubbing of the headphone and it made my earlobe

700
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:12,700
you know, infected and grew really good. Yeah, I'm not using in here. No, no, no, no, I like the ones

701
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:19,820
that cover my ear completely. Oh, that's what I grew up using, you know, and also the headphones

702
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:23,900
are used when I'm flying. It's just the ear-taste. I've had it before and twice before they've

703
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:28,220
literally had to cut it open and all this gunk comes out and it's really disgusting and it's

704
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:33,340
painful and it's not fun. So, you know, the worst thing for this to happen, of course, is

705
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:39,340
why I'm vacation in the country. You don't speak the fricking language. And I was so happy when

706
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:44,060
the doctor knocked on my door and I opened up and it was just like really cute, young woman.

707
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:49,900
And I was like, oh, okay, this is going to be all right. And well, you alone know with Patricia.

708
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,620
Well, I was there alone with Patricia was in the gym at the time. No, come on, and do,

709
00:48:54,620 --> 00:49:03,180
she's a doctor, right? And she was from Poland. And her name was Agata.

710
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:11,180
And Agata Zuba. Is that how you pronounce it? Zuba? I would have to see the spaling because you

711
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:20,780
are S Z U B A Zuba. It's the Shuba. Shuba. Shuba. Anyway, so she was really, really funny because I

712
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:25,020
had to go to the clinic because it had to be a sterile environment. She was joking around with me

713
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:29,020
said, oh, do you want the big knife, the little knife? And, you know, she was like, oh, I'll cut you here

714
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:33,180
and then she was, you know, drawing across my neck. And she was really funny, right? And so I gave her

715
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:38,780
my email address and I said, you know, if you're ever in London, you know, look me up and I'll take

716
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:46,060
you flying. I'll repay the favor. And she sent me an email. Check this out. She said, just a short email

717
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:52,300
to ask, it's funny because she writes just like you talk, CSB. It's great. Just a short email to ask

718
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:57,500
how are you alive and kicking? By the way, sometimes when I find something or someone unique,

719
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:03,660
I check it in the internet. Good to know on cute Mr. Van Gogh, what an ambition signed Agatha.

720
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,780
And then, but in her email here, I'm going to Skype this to you right now. In her email, what does

721
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:13,980
that mean? At the bottom, her signature? I just Skype this to you. Oh, this is just advertisement.

722
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:19,820
An advertisement. This is, she is using free, a service, a free email service from Poland.

723
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:27,180
Oh, crap. Oh, crap. No, it's not, I love you. Oh, like, oh, maybe she's saying really

724
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:32,540
hot. Alright. Would you do me favor? Would you just like, you just take a note. So I can write

725
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:38,540
something in Polish because you just say, uh, like something really nice, and uh, uh, and it's, you know,

726
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:45,100
it's so nice to be held by such a cute, cute girl and I hope to see your, uh, take her flying

727
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:49,500
and learn something in Polish, but I think it would be really, really cool to email her back in Polish.

728
00:50:49,500 --> 00:51:01,500
I can't write it on that fast.

729
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,500
You got to write it to me, man.

730
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,500
I can't transcribe it.

731
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,500
I would write it to you.

732
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,500
Okay, whatever.

733
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Hey, CSB.

734
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,500
I want to thank you so much, man, for doing this.

735
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,500
This is a very nice of you.

736
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,500
No problem.

737
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,500
Oh, y'all.

738
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,500
Y'all.

739
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,500
Talk to you soon.

740
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,500
I've been with Mike and my head from Queens.

741
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Cause I'm about to change y'all.

742
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:30,500
We've lost my listen, y'all.

743
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,500
I stopped you in your eye, y'all.

744
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,500
With a fucking Bible.

745
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,500
This ain't fucking Bible.

746
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,500
You shoot the sign of jail.

747
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Oh, you fucking mind, y'all.

748
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,500
It's a fucking cross my line, y'all.

749
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,500
You're so hard.

750
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,500
You are so weak.

751
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,500
You're so weak.

752
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,500
I know.

753
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,500
I don't take your life or make you die, y'all.

754
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,500
So what's your focus?

755
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,500
If I make you hate your fucking eyes, but I find no.

756
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,500
If you don't want to lack a lie, no.

757
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,500
No, no, no, no, no.

758
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,500
Oh, what's in my teeth?

759
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,500
Who's trying?

760
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,500
Fight, broke ain't nice, no, no, no.

761
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,500
When you're alive, throw a mind, go.

762
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,500
Look at my fucking eye.

763
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
Oh, the baby told you to act, throw.

764
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,500
Lock for a life, oh.

765
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,500
Satch one side, hold.

766
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,500
Right.

767
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,500
But no, in the same way as mine.

768
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

769
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,500
Sing the side, guys.

770
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,500
You're on a side.

771
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,500
Oh, hi.

772
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,500
My name's Ben Line.

773
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,500
I drew.

774
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,500
I'm sick enough to stop.

775
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,500
She ain't hit hard.

776
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,500
I got to speak bar.

777
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,500
Cause I'm a dog.

778
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,500
Stop you when you're idle.

779
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,500
When I ride mine.

780
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

781
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

782
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

783
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

784
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

785
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

786
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

787
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

788
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

789
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

790
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

791
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

792
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

793
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

794
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,500
Oh, I'm all cut-time.

795
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,500

993
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:06,340
He's on Warner Brothers records and Warner Brothers actually put this up on the PMN and I didn't

994
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:12,340
have time to set that up because well quite frankly the way I have the the mixer set up when

995
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:17,460
I call someone on Skype they can hear my voice through the microphone they don't have that

996
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,980
horrible echo it's basically like a phone bridge is what you call that but for some reason when

997
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:25,780
I play tracks out of the cast blaster the channel is running through even if the fader is completely

998
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:31,940
close it still plays pretty loud through the through the return line so I see as B couldn't hear

999
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:37,300
me and I couldn't set it up properly but anyway so okay so so we've done something new here

1000
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:44,580
I'm going to try again tomorrow hopefully tomorrow of course I'll be in San Francisco

1001

going to be there for for the rest of the week coming to you from the curry condo

1002
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:54,580
I want to talk about web radio and the new fees that have been imposed by the copy right

1003
00:56:55,220 --> 00:57:00,020
what is it the copy right board or the copyright protection friction fraction

1004
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,260

1008
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:27,940
