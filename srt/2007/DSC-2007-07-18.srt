1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Are you tired of that yet?

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Me too.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,720
This is Matt DiTilo of Matt's Today in History, and on this day in 2007, I helped

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,160
pod show suck a little less by putting together a shorter blur of asking you, a podcast

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,200
producer and listener, to visit suckless.podshow.com, and sign up to participate in some

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,000
pod show surveys that will make a difference.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Once the last time a media company asks for your opinion, never?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well then, let's make some history together.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Visit suckless.podshow.com, and get involved.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,200
In a world where women wear comfortable shoes, and technology has changed the way you get

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,000
your entertainment.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is the pod show network.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No big media.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No excuses.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No BS.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Y'all to share a Charlie 636.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I like to think I'm flying.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Make it all the money.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Where does it get?

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We'll let the past deal.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
All right, put on a show.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll see you come in the layover.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Driven down, jump.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Come home in the evening.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Watch your ear on the phone.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Watch your mouth.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We need a good time.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Time is wild.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Come on, jump, jump to the ground.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Give it up.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Give it up.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Give it up.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Give it up.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Take a trip out of the world.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Give it up.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Give it up.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Give it up.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Give it up.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Give it up.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Give it up.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Give it up.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Give it up.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Give it up.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Give it up.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Give it up.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Give it up.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Give it up.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Give it up.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Give it up.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Give it up.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Give it up.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Give it up.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Give it up.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Give it up.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Give it up.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Give it up.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Give it up.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Give it up.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Give it up.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Give it up.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Give it up.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Give it up.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Give it up.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Give it up.

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Give it up.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Give it up.

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Give it up.

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Give it up.

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Give it up.

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Give it up.

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Give it up.

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Give it up.

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Give it up.

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Give it up.

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Give it up.

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Give it up.

79
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Give it up.

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Give it up.

81
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Give it up.

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Give it up.

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Give it up, give it up as a girl

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let it out, take a trip down the road

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let it out, you better let it stop to me

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You can't take it down, you can't take it with you

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let it out, let it out

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let it out, take it, don't touch it

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're trying to escape from it

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What you got to do when you need a little time and tell us right now that I'm just up to the rhythm

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You got to give it up, give it up as a girl

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And yeah, take a trip round through

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And yeah, oh man, Hollywood, take care of you being all my life

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Can't really hide not on the pots and music networks since April 3rd

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
She's from Ontario

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I love this, I love her

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
She's awesome

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Completely pot safe and ask kicking

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Give it up

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm just read from the bio here

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
With a voice that is as sultry as it is powerful, Hollywood's captivates with their passion

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Softer strong

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
As a former lead singer of Toronto, Hollywood delivers with an experience that only comes from years of doing it right

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Bang on, eh?

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Excellent, you can find a link to that at atasourcecode.com

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's right off the pot safe music now

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Work everybody, how you doing it is episode number 636 of the daily source code

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Ooh, it just went silent

109
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Just as I started

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
They've been cleaning the carpets today here at the curry manner and swanky serene

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
West side of G-town

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That was been damn noisy

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So I waited a little bit and waited an hour and a half like I just got to start

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I got to do the show I got so much to do

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm not feeling too hot

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It feels like I have a little bit of maybe a kind of flu

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
A body type flu, it got some aches and pains going on

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Of course, I'm also an old guy

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So that could be part of it

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And again, I kind of alluded to it on Monday

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That it was going to be a really really tough week

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Not just this week but next week as well

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So you're probably going to get four Charlie's out of means

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Instead of the usual five

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Or is it really the usual four of these days?

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can't help it

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The rest of

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Sucking less just gets in the way every single time

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It was good though, yesterday

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I took the train to the UK crash pad

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
In swanky shore ditch

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Because there was a huge pile up on the M25

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And parts of it were closed for hours

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So it was actually much faster

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Just to get into the city by train

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It had tons of meetings

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And then we were doing our management off-site

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Which means we're physically removing ourselves

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
At least from the San Francisco office

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I was in the London office

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And we've got video conferencing

142
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And word doc sharing

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And that's good, it really is

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And what I should really turn that fan off

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's kind of annoying

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Or I should

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There you go, I should just leave it on

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So you can hear it better

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, we've got all the elements

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We've just got to align everything and arrange everything

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Today I will be reviewing

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I hope I'll be reviewing a cheddar

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Before it's released

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Now that may happen tonight

155
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It may still take another day

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Or maybe two

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't want to push any of the technology

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And there's lots of things to be evaluated

159
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Because it is, of course, something that's going to go live

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Even though it's kind of like a little beta test

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
For us folks to people listening to the Charlie

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Essentially to kind of mess around with

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And there's no explanation of how it works

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It'll just kind of show up

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah plenty of explanations on my web

166
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Bloggerdcurry.com

167
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But

168
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So hopefully we'll be able to be using

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The new channel editor, codename cheddar

170
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Very, very soon

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let me see

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
When I got back last night

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Which was around

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hold on, let me just turn off this fan for a second

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't move

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hey, I saw you move

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Actually, it wasn't the fan

178
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It is indeed the carpet sucking device

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
As downstairs

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I saw the, I guess it was

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The first episode of the Beckhams

182
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Coming to America show

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Which is David Beckham in

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Posh Spice, Victoria Adams

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Dash Beckham

186
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's their reality show

187
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Now I heard that

188
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I guess they changed something

189
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Somehow they moved upscale with the production

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
19 entertainment is doing

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Those are the same folks who do

192
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Like pop idol and really really good editors

193
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And I recognize some of the names

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Because I'm trying to look at that stuff

195
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
When the credits flow by

196
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I gotta tell you I like the show a lot

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Obviously a lot of what they're doing in the show

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Is being done specifically

199
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, because it's great for the show

200
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I recognize that

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But I like Victoria

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I've never met her in person

203
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And from the public persona that

204
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The perception you get

205
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
She's stuck up and

206
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Difficult and cranky

207
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But she's funny man

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
In fact, I have to say she reminds me

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Quite a bit of the lady Patricia herself

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So that has a lot to do with it

211
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But not bad, not bad at all

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I guess that's a weekly show

213
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's coming back

214
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Something to email that just blew me away

215
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I think

216
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We have an internal project

217
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Which has codename big number

218
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can only imagine

219
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
With all the shows that we're serving up

220
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And all of the different page views

221
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There's lots and lots and lots and lots

222
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Of data being transferred

223
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And so this is a statistic

224
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Since January 2006

225
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I hope I'm getting this right

226
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It appears that we've served over 1 billion megabytes

227
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So

228
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Wait a minute

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's a petabyte I think it is

230
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Or 1,000 terabytes

231
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's an amazing amount of something

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And part of it came from this lovely young lady

233
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey Adam, it's Andy

234
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Gosh, I've been so busy the past week

235
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Getting a final mix of the love spirals together

236
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
To master our new album this weekend

237
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That I was just now getting caught up with

238
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Daily Source code and saw that you played me last Saturday

239
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I feel so bad I missed it

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I just thought I'd mention that that's actually

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The D minor remix

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He's a local hip-hop artist from Los Angeles

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And we met her to show

244
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He said he wanted to do a remix

245
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I really don't know what was it

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And thanks so much for playing it

247
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I also was thinking of you last night

248
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Because

249
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't want to know

250
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Don't you don't even have to say

251
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Just the fact that you were thinking of me last night

252
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Isn't enough

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let me just

254
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let me just

255
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Wallow in the splendor of that for a second

256
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay

257
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's see what you were thinking

258
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Am I heard that Podshow had signed the Let's get

259
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Notty Podcast

260
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Which is so cool

261
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,760
Um, called into the show a couple times and Eric's been after me to come on as a guest hostess.

262
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,640
So we were actually talking about hooking that up for this week.

263
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,560
So you'll definitely want to stay tuned for that.

264
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,360
Should be fun.

265
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,480
And um, yeah, anyways, it's just great to be in touch with you.

266
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,640
Thanks for the promo love and I'll be talking to you again real soon.

267
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,360
Sanjubi and Anjubi.com.

268
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,160
Yo, yeah, baby.

269
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,040
Okay, Angie.

270
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,760
Uh, promo love for you anytime, my girlfriend.

271
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,320
If you, uh, hopefully, if the upload upload, if the upload went well, uh, you'll see, uh,

272
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,520
well, what do you call these things?

273
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,120
Look at the album art for a second.

274
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,440
Uh, hold on.

275
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,480
Oh, no, of course I lost that email.

276
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,440
I wanted to tell you exactly what it's called and who sent that to me.

277
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,000
Uh, crap, crap, crap.

278
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,920
Ah, can't find it.

279
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,280
Um,

280
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,080
shoot.

281
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,120
Well, look at the album art.

282
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,560
It's, uh, it's not an anagram.

283
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,200
It's a, uh, uh, hold on a second.

284
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,720
I really want to find this for you because it's, it's well worth it.

285
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,200
Don't move.

286
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,960
Yeah, here it is.

287
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,080
Oh, and be gram.

288
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,640
That's what it is.

289
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,600
From Fritz Junker.

290
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,400
Uh, he, it, this is amazing.

291
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,320
These, these, and be grams, they're, they read the same,

292
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,080
writes it up and upside down.

293
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,920
So he sent one with Adam Curry.

294
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,440
That's the one I put in today's feed.

295
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,080
So if, you know, if you turn your iPod upside down,

296
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,000
it's, it still says Adam Curry.

297
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,040
It's really, it's a mind freak is what it is.

298
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
He sent another one with D.S.C.

299
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,640
And, uh, and Trinity, I sent one for Trinity.

300
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,640
He said, this is perfect for, you know, just in case Trinity ever should be upside down.

301
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,160
And it ditched for some reason like that.

302
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,400
Fantastic.

303
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,640
Got some stuff to talk about Trinity as well, by the way.

304
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,520
First, uh, uh, email from Chris Lighten.

305
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,120
Adam thought I'd, uh, thought you might like to know after hearing red by Sammy Hagar.

306
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,440
I immediately went to the iTunes store and bought the track.

307
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,080
Not only did I buy the track, but I chose to buy it in the iTunes plus format.

308
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,280
As you know, I'm rather young.

309
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,200
So this music to the soundtrack of your life is completely new music for mine.

310
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,560
Thanks for the music education.

311
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,680
Keep up your fantastic work.

312
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,800
Well, I'd like to take credit for that.

313
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,120
But of course, that is all thanks to the, uh,

314
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,680
organization for the preservation to the soundtrack of our life.

315
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,760
So, uh, use of that in conjunction with the mission from Sammy Hagar in advance,

316
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,200
because he's a friend of the show, uh, you know,

317
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,120
we're, it's a kind of like a fair use thing.

318
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,600
I think.

319
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,640
Did I explain that right?

320
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,640
And of course, we played that red as a part of the red pill blue pill matrix,

321
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,720
unjacking that, uh, I'm thinking about how to work on it, how to, how to,

322
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,320
how to get more people to take the red pill.

323
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,120
This is your last chance.

324
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,760
After this, there's no turning back.

325
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,760
You take the blue pill.

326
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,360
The story ends.

327
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,480
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want.

328
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,840
You take the red pill.

329
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,040
You stay in Wonderland.

330
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,640
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

331
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,000
Remember, all I'm offering is the truth.

332
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,400
Nothing.

333
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,840
Hmm.

334
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,080
Yeah, that debate rages on here in the UK.

335
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm hearing documentary filmmakers talking about decisions that are,

336
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,360
that are made in the edit rooms.

337
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,040
There is such a brew ha ha ha going on here,

338
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,960
particularly with all these, uh, you know, for pay phone numbers and, uh,

339
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,800
and text message services that are advertised on television.

340
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,520
And everyone is now just jumping out, you know, it's kind of like

341
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,880
it's just amnesty periods.

342
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,080
So everyone can say, oh, you know, well, we messed up too.

343
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,120
And, you know, and I guess we kind of cheated people out of money.

344
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,240
And, uh, yeah, it's just going to have a much deeper impact than anyone realizes.

345
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,080
There is so much money being made, uh, not just by the television producers and the television

346
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:07,480
broadcasters, but also, uh, by the, uh, the telephony providers, uh, providers of text messaging services.

347
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,320
So I predict you're going to, you're going to hear a lot more about that, uh,

348
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,840
uh, from the financial world as well, because it's really becoming a problem.

349
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,840
These guys have had a free ride for probably five to six years.

350
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,320
And, uh, and now the public is just not going to take it anymore.

351
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,840
Because guess what, they've been lying.

352
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,040
They've been completely bullshitting you on so many different fronts.

353
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,160
But it's nothing new.

354
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,400
I posted it the other day, the XNTV experiment, please take it.

355
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,880
You know, it only take an hour or two out of your day.

356
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,920
Uh, some of the tests you don't even actually have to do.

357
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,680
You know, you can imagine what the results will be.

358
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,160
But doing it will, will blow your socks off.

359
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,160
And considering we, we watch about, you know, 18 hours of television a week.

360
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,360
I, I think you can probably take the time to, to check it out.

361
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,400
So, Mel's very cool, uh, podfinder US being resurrected.

362
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,560
This is the show that we started, uh, when iTunes launched with podcast and capability,

363
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,760
it's, uh, to be found at podfinder.podshow.com.

364
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,760
And, uh, every week, I'll be looking at, uh, different podcasts, pod shows,

365
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,320
independent audio and video radio and television across the globe, uh, for you to enjoy.

366
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,560
Uh, we even have an enhanced version that'll be up as well.

367
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,040
So, uh, you can, uh, click to subscribe in iTunes.

368
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,680
And, uh, and then I'm doing this, of course, uh, with the, uh, with the production guys,

369
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,480
uh, PWB and Brian, and they're having a lot of fun putting it together.

370
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,000
They're themed. So it's, uh, it's, you know, it's like it's like a proper show.

371
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,480
We've actually organized it into something that makes sense.

372
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:39,080
And, um, well, you know, I, uh, I made an offer to, uh, the fine folks at a year at the

373
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,840
wheel.com, who were planning on driving around the United States, um, four years, starting

374
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,640
in November. And, uh, and we're going to hit, uh, all the big, uh, events and hot spots.

375
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,920
So, like the White House and, uh, and the, uh, Republican convention, I think the Democratic

376
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,880
National Convention as well. And, uh, they're making a statement. Uh, you know, not quite sure

377
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,480
what the statement is, but it doesn't matter because it's all about freedom. It's all about

378
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,600
independence. And I've added to that, can we also put in some independence from big oil

379
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,600
by providing Trinity for this trip around the United States? And I'm very happy to report that

380
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:21,640
I have received an answer. Hey, Adam, I wanted to thank you from my cold, cold heart.

381
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,480
Uh, I wanted to really thank you for that offer. Uh, I wish you would have, his, his cold heart.

382
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,840
This is a guy modeled after me, uh, done the sooner, but we're trying to hook up a whole new, uh,

383
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,760
Amy. I'm so excited. It's Shane and Amy and we're really excited to do the, uh,

384
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:47,720
biodiesel road trip. That will be so cool. Yeah, Shane and Amy from a year at the wheel.com.

385
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:55,800
And I'm so excited, you know, to make someone like me speechless is hard to do. Um, but I really,

386
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,480
uh, as silly as maybe we sound accepting your challenge for the biodiesel scene as the only

387
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,280
pictures I've seen have been broken down on the side of the road. Um, as long as I don't have to

388
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,680
wear clown makeup on with the car, I, you know, I thought you sounded a bit like Keith from Keith

389
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,920
in the girl, but I know you don't have to wear the, uh, the clown makeup down, man. I think so at least,

390
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,120
you know, I, I can't wait to work things out with you, but do you, uh, this is great. That sounds

391
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:26,360
so cool. We were talking about how we wanted it to be a green trip. So this is really exciting.

392
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,480
Well, let me just say it's not going to be completely green because there's all kinds of

393
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:37,480
viewpoints about carbon footprint, uh, regardless of what type of, uh, what type of fuel you're

394
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,680
using, but it certainly is a trip about independence. Uh, that I completely give you. People told

395
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,640
us, we'll smell like a chicken nugget. Yeah, but there's nothing wrong with that. Spread your chicken

396
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,440
wings and smell like a nugget. That true. I can't imagine someone with such a great appearance,

397
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,320
like you're savvy, seem like a very, what does that call the, uh, bass suit? No, we'll not

398
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,440
do you're not a student, but what does that Amy, uh, when you keep yourself tidy?

399
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,880
Feet best 10 years. Yeah, you look like a very fast tedious gentleman.

400
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:16,120
Wait, when it first tedious, let's see, dictionary dot com. How do you spell for

401
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:24,840
tedious? Let me see. Um, uh, would it be fast, did deas? Let's try this.

402
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:37,480
Okay. No, it would be FA fast tedious, FA STID IOUS. Let's see if that's correct.

403
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Uh, excessively particular critical demanding hard to please requiring or characterized by

404
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:54,040
excessive care or delicate, the delicacy pay, okay. You mean like a, uh, a prissy, a prissy boy who

405
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,440
likes shit to be right. Uh-huh. Why can't imagine you go around town smelling like a chicken nugget,

406
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,160
but maybe I'm wrong. I do too. You know, who I don't know. I love it. I think that this is very cool,

407
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,160
though, and you know, I'm going to send you some clips of a radio show we ran last night,

408
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,520
where I talk about possibly getting your face tattooed on my back. If you really make everything happen,

409
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,400
yeah, I, I thought because I have such a hairy back, I could actually do your hair just as

410
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,720
on my back, so I'm like, you're really good. I could, right? Uh, Shane, do no need, man. No need

411
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,680
whatsoever to get into that kind of detail. Okay. So Adam, I mean, I'm really stoked about this.

412
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,320
You're, you're insane. And this is what I like. It's going to be awesome. And you know what,

413
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,080
why pod show.com rule so much is because of that, that pod safe music network. That's where

414
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,560
you show your hearts into the shit. Yeah. It's not just not that you're not a greedy bastard,

415
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,640
you know, for money, but you got it right. I'm totally a greedy bastard. And I don't know if

416
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,360
you're a greedy bastard, but I'm just saying that is really shows your heart is into the shit.

417
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,600
And we promise we'll park the Trinity right in front of the White House and take pictures,

418
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,320
though. Oh, yes. Right. Oh, love one in front of the White House. You wait. That Trinity photos

419
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,320
you're going to be more than broken on photos on podshow.com. Well, we get done with

420
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,360
the Trinity. Trinity at the Grand Canyon. That's right. Yeah. The St. Louis Arts. I love it.

421
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,160
I love it. Trinity at a Metallica concert. Hey, there's, who's the good, no, not me.

422
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,320
Metallica is dead to me. Oh, no. Who's that guy? Roger Waters. We're going to the Roger Roger

423
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,440
Waters. City of Trinity playing a guitar. Can you see it? No, I love it. I love it. All right,

424
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,240
forget the celebrities. Chicken fighting going on in the back of Trinity, you know.

425
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,080
Chicken fighting. Yeah. All right. How about some maybe oil restilling? Yeah. That's my address.

426
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,240
See, this is why this is a good chance. My wife is cool. Oh, she's awesome, dude.

427
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,760
We'll see you soon, Adam. A year at thewheel.com. Shane, Shane, Amy, guys. You guys are fantastic.

428
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:56,360
That's it. Yeah, that's over. Awesome. So we've got a moody coming in. He's probably

429
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,400
leaving on a flight this morning from San Francisco to come to the UK. He's a big moochachah

430
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,800
ahead of production. So we're going to do a kickoff call this weekend. Now, there's still some

431
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,120
things I want to incorporate. Because obviously, I want the free Trinity group to get into the mix

432
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,480
here. Now, these guys already have a route planned and they sent me a map. It looks awesome. They

433
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,000
literally are driving, you know, a big huge ass circle around the United States. And they were

434
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,160
planning on starting in Chicago. So that I think is going to change. Actually, let me play a little

435
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,880
bit. They had some, there's like some local radio show they called into. It was pretty funny.

436
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,160
I think this is the clip on the show. Shane, both of you, what's going on, brother? Yeah,

437
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,920
you know, Ed just said, we're sort of setting the map out our trip to go across country and stuff.

438
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,480
Yeah. Now, Bob was telling me about this and sent me, uh, and then I got your bolt in from

439
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,200
your Myspace. You're doing something with the Adam Curry there. The guy, he's like the, they call

440
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,160
him the father of podcasting. Godfather. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's what they call it.

441
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,680
Yeah, I know him from the old days of what had been his ball. So it's a double. Yeah, but that's

442
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,440
awesome. But but anyone who doesn't know Shane's a, is a good friend of the show. Very good

443
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,240
pal of the show. And uh, I wait a minute. They're using fun to the show as well. And he's doing

444
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,880
he's in the midst of starting something that's pretty fascinating. It's called, uh, not anyway.

445
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,160
Uh, I should probably find if that's a podcast feed, I'll put it into the into the channel.

446
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,960
Also, I want to figure out a way to involve Doug Pilgrim since it really was his idea

447
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,760
to do a cross country trip with his son. And I don't want to, you know, I don't want to harsh him

448
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,720
out of this. So we've got to figure out a way to include Doug and his son. Um, I'm very excited

449
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,760
about this. Very, very excited. Now, uh, so we're going to do this with without sponsors. I am going

450
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,760
to have to do something with the paint job for Trinity. We got to put some, you know, logos and stickers

451
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,160
and some shit and get her ready and ramped up. And we have a little bit of time because they want

452
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,360
to kick it off in November. Uh, so that actually works out very well for me. And, uh, it gives us

453
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,400
a, you know, a definite date to work towards. And we can do a lot of stuff, um, a lot of prep along

454
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,800
the way. So we have some time. So I'm very, very excited. Thank you guys for accepting. Can't wait

455
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:07,960
to talk to you over the weekend and we'll get everything kicked off. Uh, let me see.

456
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,360
I wanted to do more things before I leave you for today. Oh, Jersey Todd sent me, uh, I got to put

457
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:22,600
this link in the show notes about, uh, sound exchange and, uh, and the new fees for, uh, for internet

458
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,400
radio for streaming playlists. Very interesting. Um, the, uh, and this is, uh, one of these lawyer, uh,

459
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,640
websites, which of course I really, you know, appreciate the fact that he sent this to me, uh,

460
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,320
where lawyers discuss thing. And I like, I don't know if it's a, it's, it's a new site. Oh,

461
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,600
I probably looks like more like a weblog. Uh, what does it called? The Rit, the Rit.

462
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,320
Fine. Oh, it's a find law. Legal news and commentary. And so their take on all of this is that,

463
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,200
you know, as you probably heard by now, um, sound exchange, who was supposed to collect all these,

464
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,680
you know, millions of dollars starting Monday, uh, has extended like for a six-day period, uh,

465
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:05,240
the negotiations and conversations with, uh, the webcasters, uh, to try and figure out, you know,

466
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,480
these fees and, uh, and, you know, caps on the fees and essentially what they're going to be paying.

467
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,520
And what they distill it down to is that this is really a bad signal. They're saying that sound

468
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:23,160
exchange just really has no way to actually enforce this, uh, these fees. You know, they only have,

469
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:28,920
like, you know, 30 people on staff and they have no way of, of tracking everybody down. So you should

470
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:35,080
read that. It's, uh, it's pretty interesting. Um, but at the end of the day, they say, look, if even

471
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,000
if sound exchange can't figure this out, somebody will because it's money in the bank,

472
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,320
so all this is probably predicated by the fact that sound exchange just haven't,

473
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,640
doesn't really have the infrastructure, uh, to go and, uh, and collect these fees. So thank you,

474
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,520
Jersey Todd. Of course, we'll be hearing from him on, uh, on Friday as the official musicologist

475
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:59,080
of the Charlie. Also shout out to the guys over at the one more thing podcast. They, uh,

476
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:06,280
they asked me, you should go and check it out. It's at MacOSX.nl. They asked me to, uh,

477
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,360
to put together a little, uh, voice over for one of their special shows. I'm not going to,

478
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,160
I'm not going to blow it for you. It's a, it's a video show. So, uh, another thing I could put a link

479
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,080
to in the show. And I was definitely take a look at that. Uh, they're, they're having some fun

480
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,640
over there in, in the Netherlands. And then finally, uh, Martin, uh, thought guy dot com says Adam, uh,

481
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,120
you know, uh, on those European threat levels you talked about Monday. Uh, did you somehow miss these?

482
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,120
Now, remember, this is, uh, the threat levels that other countries have the United States, of course,

483
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,240
is currently, uh, stuck at orange. And they could be elevated to red at any time in Switzerland.

484
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,440
The terrorist threat level is being maintained on, there is no threat as long as the trains run on time.

485
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,560
God. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the threat level has also been changed recently.

486
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,040
Having long since passed through the baseline levels of, why does everybody hate us and surround

487
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,240
uh, everyone with everything to charge in shooting wildly at everything, including your own side.

488
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,600
And that was belittedly raised to now we're here. How do we get out?

489
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,600
Uh, this is going to be a bit far, man. This has raised considerable worldwide concern as the only

490
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,640
two higher US threat levels are invades somewhere else. So it looks like we know what we're doing.

491
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:19,560
And trigger a nuclear holocaust and hope for the best. And the Japanese threat level finally remains

492
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:25,240
at it would have all been so much better if you'd let us win the war, which is the only level

493
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,360
they apparently have.

494
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,880
Haha, alright. Check this out, it's phased.

495
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,360
Okay, nice and accurate, like a first fire farm, as my words are sharp as steel of the

496
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,880
Dakotana. I never knew a girl called so much plus in drama. This duo taking back her country

497
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,000
like the Dalai Lama. You're not some Maya rival of the king in the air. We'll fit in now

498
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,040
words like a fully loaded barrel. A construct with lyrics like Swatima Parallel,

499
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,520
bringing latest headlines. So call me Will Parallel and then girls do his call.

500
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:20,920
Jennings or diseases when I grip this mic. My general thesis, spit miracles like the incredible

501
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:26,040
Jesus women who didn't like the way with regrettable the sweetness. I never said back,

502
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,000
and watched my life more and have six spending money on how to praise gold. I plan my

503
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,440
cards right, always making nice words because women now are gazing, nothing but ice cold.

504
00:27:50,920 --> 00:28:04,600
It's your boy phased next back. Yeah, it again. It's complicated shit. It's gone down

505
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,000
way too quick. When me and you is pretty tight at one point in time, but your girl

506
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,200
Mr. Dub was at some sort of crime. I don't take a person though. You've made the wrong choice.

507
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,240
So he stopped being tight and we stopped being boys. While he leaned me hanging, I thought it

508
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,960
was your boy, boys. You and her were done. Now we're back to be a boy. So he's still kids

509
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,440
though, and I'm always be your boy. So he's just back and forth. No doubt there was

510
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,560
vodka. Said it rums now, all the bullshit's done. Done. Asked how we yard out,

511
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,000
probes is none. No evidence wasn't there. We're real sorry, but we all make mistakes.

512
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,400
Fucking pissed off and was slow. Though I would be honest and tell the fucking truth,

513
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:53,480
it's a beef and a bad, it wasn't beef. I don't know, man. It's kind of pot safe, I guess.

514
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,840
All the zi's featuring expected space from pot safe music. Now we're rinks in the show notes

515
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,520
of DailySourceCode.com. Very interesting fade out there as well. I look at the calendar. I'll be

516
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,680
good for a show tomorrow and of course the food bar Friday because I've got stuff in the city

517
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,160
but only in the afternoon. So it's going to be able to get through this. And let me make a

518
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,640
prediction right now. I'm really into weather. I'm really, really into it. We've been having

519
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:25,240
some, you know, this La Nina, La Nina weather has been messing us up and actually Australia has

520
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,200
been having some issues with weather. You know, it was raining and hailing about an hour ago and

521
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,320
now it's a beautiful blue skies. Prediction and please hold me to this next week is going to be

522

you, T. Full in the United Kingdom. You can bank on it. Adam at podshow.com DailySourceCode.com
