1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
I can't throw this, I can't.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,600

Hort City.podshow.com.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,400
You know, we'll be now to hear on the prairie ain't easy.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,600
A lot of minds after cookie finishes.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,800
Mixing us up some grubwee.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Consider how to camp fire and tell stories.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,200
Maybe have a little camaraderie.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,600
Then we snuggle up in Spoon and listen to the DSC, 637.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,800
It's awful nice here, broke back mountain.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Now that I'm curious, just put this in the mood.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,800
The lower here's levy, you can borrow one of my headphones.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,800
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,800
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,800
See ya from underground.

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Who've done the sound?

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Come set the fire, burn the old dial.

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
A lot of China's now.

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
You are never known.

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
All our numbers are grown.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Can't stand the thought of all that said.

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
And you are wasted.

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
You've been bought to the bones.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Sick with all you've been shown.

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
You've eaten time.

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
You've eaten time.

30
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Two of the bowls ask you to keep far.

31
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Two of my bowls ask you to keep far.

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Thin magic can't decide.

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Three bowls ask you to keep far.

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,800
We're in control, everywhere you go

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Once we start to flow, you're in the know

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Let the police see each other, we can't stop the bleeding

37
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Suck away the green, break down the beach, liberate for free

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Kill the radio crew

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,800
You are never known, all I know is a ground

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Can stand a part of our integrity, and we share

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
You'll be more new than mine

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Say, we love you, and we share

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
You'll be the fucking tank

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Turn it, and we share

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Black people taking a lot

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Black people taking a lot

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Investors getting close, Bart

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Black people taking a lot

49
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Black people taking over

50
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Black people taking over

51
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Investors getting close

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,720
Not for you to take it all up!

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Come on, baby, watch out, yeah

54
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Yeah, come on, baby, watch out, yeah

55
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Yeah, come on, baby, watch out, yeah

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Yeah, come on, baby, watch out, yeah

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Come on, baby, watch out, yeah

58
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Come on, baby, watch out, yeah

59
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Come on, baby, watch out, yeah

60
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Come on, baby, watch out, yeah

61
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Come on, baby, watch out, yeah

62
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Come on, baby, watch out, yeah

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Come on, baby, watch out, yeah

64
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,800
There's just days that are perfect to roll monk out

65
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Pod people taking over because the revolution has progressed

66
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Yet another step, my friends, that's right

67
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Mainstream media coming apart at the scenes in the United Kingdom

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
And it's going to spread worldwide

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,800
And we can start watching it as of today

70
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Sit back and enjoy this ride

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Daily source code episode number 637 coming to you

72
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
From the affluent suburb of Surrey

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
No one is killed for a G-town west side in the curry manner

74
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,800
And what a perfect day, I'm so excited to talk to you about

75
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
What's going on over here?

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
I have alluded about it, alluded to it for the past couple days

77
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,800
This fits in perfectly with the conversation about the society of the spectral goal

78
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Because the BBC is falling apart

79
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Not just the BBC, but all media now is under huge scrutiny here in the United Kingdom

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
And this is not just a ding in the armor of mainstream media

81
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
It is a huge chunk

82
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,800
There's a crack, we can stick our, the limit in there

83
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,800
And start making them bleed and I'm counting on you to help

84
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Let me explain what's going on why I'm so excited today

85
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
First of all, yesterday a report came out from the BBC

86
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,800
I've been keeping up to speed on what's been going on

87
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Is that all of these practices within television at the BBC

88
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Which is publicly funded

89
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Not just through some tax budget

90
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
But actually by paying every individual household that has at least

91
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,800
One television or radio has to pay about $300 a year

92
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
For the right to actually use that

93
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Because we're presuming that you're going to watch BBC

94
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
The BBC is actually a trust

95
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,800
It's called the BBC Trust

96
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Trust being the big word here

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Because we pay this money

98
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,800
We trust the BBC to come up with fair

99
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,800
And oh boy, how weird does that sound?

100
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,800
And balanced programming that is not driven by commercial interests

101
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Now of course we're not crazy

102
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,800
We all know particularly with government run

103
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Mainstream media that there's a lot of politics involved

104
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Their funding depends on how the politics are played

105
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Report today came out that says in the run up to the invasion of Iraq

106
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Tony Blair met with Rupert Murdoch a number of times

107
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,800
In three days running in three day run up to the actual invasion

108
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Hmm, I wonder why

109
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Okay, so this all started with this documentary about the queen

110
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Which has not even been released yet

111
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
But the trailer was proven to be false

112
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
The queen was outraged, the palace, the royal family

113
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Because they edited things out of sequence to kind of sex up

114
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,800
The queen's reaction to Annie Lieber was asking her to take off her

115
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
It wasn't even a crown her tiara for a photo shoot

116
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
And showed her storming off which was actually her walking into the photos

117
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,800
And now things are just bubbling up to the top

118
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
The BBC is going through a wide scale investigation

119
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Here's just part of the report that came out yesterday

120
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Here's some of the falsehoods, lies, trickery and cheating

121
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,800
That the BBC has by their own admission has taken part in

122
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Comic Relief March 16th, 2007 BBC won

123
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,800
In a section of this appeal program

124
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Viewers were invited to donate money to comic relief

125
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
That by calling in they could win prizes that belonged to a famous couple

126
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,800
The first two callers taken on air gave incorrect answers

127
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
The other waiting callers were lost

128
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,800
And a third caller was heard on air successfully answered the question

129
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
This caller wasn't fact not a viewer

130
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,800
But a member of the production team

131
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,800
TMI September 16th, 2006 on BBC 2 and on CBC is a kids program

132
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Following a production problem with a live competition

133
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Viewers were led to believe that a member of the audience was involved

134
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
And won a competition open to the public

135
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,800
In fact, the caller was a member of the production team

136
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,800
The program team failed to seek proper advice before running the competition

137
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Sports relief July 15th, 2006 BBC won

138
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Viewers were led to believe that a member of the public was involved in

139
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
And won a competition open to the public

140
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Whereas the caller was in fact, you guessed it, a member of the production team

141
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Children in need November 18th, 2005 BBC won Scotland

142
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
In a segment called Raven

143
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,800
The island in BBC Children's need appeals

144
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Scotland broadcast in 2005 Viewers were led to believe that a phone

145
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
In competition opened to the audience had been won by a viewer

146
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,800
In fact due to a technical mistake calls from the public did not get through

147
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,800
And the name of a fictitious winner was read on the air

148
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,800
The Liz Kershaw Show 2005 on BBC 6 music in pre-recorded programs

149
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Presented as if they were live

150
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,800
A competition was announced that appeared to feature genuine listeners

151
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Foning into take part one of whom could win a prize on air

152
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,800
In fact, in recorded programs there were no competitions or prizes

153
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,800
And all of the callers were actually members of the production team and their friends

154
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,800
A new producer took over the program in December 2006

155
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,800
And stopped the practices as a matter of priority

156
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Finally, white label, world service, BBC

157
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Until April 2006 a weekly pop music preview program on the English service

158
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,800
On more than one occasion a fake winner was announced for the CD prize

159
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,800
When no winning entries had actually been received

160
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Gee

161
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,800
And you think that's all you think that's it

162
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
You think that's all that's been fake

163
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Let me tell you what happens in television

164
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,800
And then we're going to listen to some beautiful words from David Cox

165
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Long time television producer here in the United Kingdom

166
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Who was on News Night last night

167
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
I can't tell you how excited I am about this

168
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,800
We are going to bring these suckers down

169
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Television is inherently a trickery medium

170
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
It was designed that way

171
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
It was magic when it first came out

172
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,800
I'm going to tell you just a couple of examples of how I involved in television production

173
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Have deceived the public on purpose

174
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Not for financial benefit or gain

175
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Well, that depends on how you look at it

176
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Because of course

177
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,800
If you tell someone that you have a satellite interview with Janet Jackson

178
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,800
And you promote that so that people will come and watch your show

179
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Therefore your ratings go up

180
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,800
That of course can be seen this 100% deception

181
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
That I did that several times

182
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
This is exactly what happened in the 80s

183
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,800
When I was in the Netherlands working for a public broadcaster

184
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,800
The organization was Veronica Broadcasting

185
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
I did a program called Countdown

186
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
And we would receive electronic press kits

187
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,800
From record companies for their major artists

188
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
So when Janet Jackson came out with her album

189
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,800
I think that was the one that had what if you'd done from me lately on it

190
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Huge album

191
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Janet Jackson you could not get a bigger star

192
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
In fact we couldn't get Janet Jackson in the studio

193
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,800
But the electronic press kit really consisted of an interview with Janet

194
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
So questions would be asked off screen

195
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
And Janet would be answering those questions

196
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,800
And so what we would do is we would and this was sent out for this very purpose by the way

197
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,800
To take sound bites from or what we did

198
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,800
And I had a big part in this because I didn't concoct it

199
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
But I did completely execute it

200
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,800
I looked at all the answers that Janet gave

201
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
I wrote up questions which of course were similar to the questions asked

202
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
But not the exact questions

203
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,800
So already right there I was going over the line

204
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,800
I think I was not asking the exact questions she was responding to

205
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,800
We edited a tape about three and a half minutes of Janet's answers

206
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,800
And black spaces in between

207
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,800
And I timed my questioning to that tape

208
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
So imagine here's what happened

209
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
I would sit there and say okay we got Janet Jackson on the side

210
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Like while I was saying that they would show a frame of that tape

211
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,800
So it looked like we literally put in fuzzy stuff

212
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Like the satellite was coming in and out

213
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Of course this was the 80s when a satellite interview was still a huge deal

214
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
We did not have the internet at the time

215
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Or at least we weren't using it the way we used it today

216
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,800
And then I knew the cues I knew would ask the question

217
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Janet's answer would come I wish I could find this tape

218
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Or copy of it because you'll see that I probably even through in a

219
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Funny question to which she gave a totally different response

220
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Just to really sex up the whole interview

221
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Complete utter deception my god

222
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,800
This was a music program on television

223
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Where the artists came on and pretended to actually perform

224
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,800
They had their guitars with actual cords plugged in

225
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Microphones with cords plugged in plugged in

226
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
And nothing on the other end

227
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,800
There was no mixing board there were lip syncing entirely

228
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
It was there was just mining to the track

229
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
That of course is complete deception

230
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Now it's not like we don't know that anymore

231
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,800
But it is it's inherent to the medium

232
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Why? Well, it's very expensive to get a great sound for a band live

233
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Particularly if you have a 45-minute program once a week

234
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,800
And you have to shove 809 artists onto a stage

235
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I mean it's a huge cost huge production

236
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Absolutely no budget

237
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,800
And of course the artists and the record companies

238
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Complicit in this whole affair because they stood up there and they faked right along

239
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
And this is just one tiny example

240
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,800
I can give you millions of examples of how television

241
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Deceives the viewers all the time

242
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Please go take the XNTV experiment

243
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
You will not be disappointed it will open your eyes

244
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
It will give you a complete red pill moment

245
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
I guarantee you

246
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,800
But right now we're starting to

247
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Collectively lick the red pill

248
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
We're starting to figure out what's going on

249
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
And there's a number of reasons for it

250
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,800
And I think that if we all

251
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Really focus on this

252
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,800
And we start the wave roll in here because the BBC

253
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
You know it's like

254
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
All right the curtain is open

255
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
The underpants are down

256
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
The bear bottom of the trust is showing

257
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
This is going on everywhere

258
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
It's going on in commercial television

259
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
You don't hear a lot of people weighing in

260
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,800
About this deception of viewers in the United States

261
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
I'm telling you

262
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Network executives are pooping their pants right now

263
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
They don't want any of this

264
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Eki stuff spilling over to them in the US

265
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
We have to do it

266
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
We have to expose them

267
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
It's part of our revolution

268
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Now not saying that there's no deception going on

269
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,800
In online television and radio and podcast

270
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Independent media

271
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
I can only speak for myself

272
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
You know I'm full of shit

273
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
You know what my mode of stars

274
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
You know what I want to do

275
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
I'm not trying to hide behind anything

276
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
And I'm not taking money from you on an annual basis

277
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Pretending that I'm giving you fair and balanced television

278
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Production

279
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
So this is really coming to a head

280
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Last night on News Night a big news talk program

281
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Here in the United Kingdom

282
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Of course they had a lengthy interview with

283
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,800
The chairman of the trust

284
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Of the BBC who was

285
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
His position of course is being questioned

286
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Should he resign or not

287
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
And then they go into a conversation

288
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
A live on air

289
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Luckily

290
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Between Michael Gray

291
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Who used to be

292
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
The keeper of the trust of the BBC

293
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
And is now the head of ITV

294
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
In the UK commercial

295
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Commercial network of stations

296
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Of channels

297
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
And David Cox

298
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Long time television producer

299
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Who pulls no punches

300
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
And says some beautiful things

301
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
So beautiful

302
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,800
I wanted to just play him for you today

303
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
It's about eight minutes

304
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
And total I'm going to give commentary

305
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
And I'm going to show you

306
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
What's happening

307
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
With a little bit of Mark Thompson

308
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Talking about just the tail end of his interview

309
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Talking about the trust of the BBC

310
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
And what he's trying to do to contain this

311
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
But trust me

312
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
These guys are trying to cover up everything

313
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Because every single program

314
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Everything you see

315
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Has deception and trickery in it

316
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Because it's part of the medium

317
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
I think the way to judge me

318
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
The way to judge

319
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
The whole leadership of the BBC

320
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Is how we react to those mistakes

321
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
And whether if we discover weaknesses in our system

322
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
We put things in place to reduce

323
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Or eliminate those weaknesses entirely

324
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
That's what we're going to do

325
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
And I will be judged

326
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
The BBC Trust have made it very clear today

327
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
To me today

328
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
That they will judge me

329
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
And they'll judge my colleagues

330
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
On our success

331
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
In

332
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Taking this utterly seriously

333
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Which I assure you we do

334
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
But then over the coming months

335
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Everything all the steps in place to make sure

336
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
That these instances

337
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Either never happen again

338
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Which of course is the ideal

339
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Or that the chances of them happening

340
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Is reduced to absolutely a small

341
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Is it humanly can be?

342
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Do you accept that the

343
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
The BBC license fee is based

344
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
On trust from the British public

345
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
And tonight many people

346
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Will be saying why should we trust the BBC

347
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Great, great, great question

348
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Everyone who pays the license fee

349
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Within the sound of my voice

350
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
You should be prepared to really cause a

351
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
Shitstorm about this

352
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I believe that in these instances

353
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
We let the public down very badly

354
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
What I would say is I hope that the public

355
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Would also recognise

356
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
That what we've done today

357
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
And what we've done over the last few months

358
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Is trying to be very open and honest

359
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
About this issue

360
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Both about the fact that it exists

361
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
To explore

362
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I think more thoroughly than in the other blockers

363
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
I'm aware of exactly how

364
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
How to extend this problem

365
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Is how widespread it is

366
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
And also that we are totally committed

367
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
To putting this right

368
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
And in this respect

369
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Fully winning back their confidence

370
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Thank you very much

371
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Okay, okay

372
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
So

373
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Cover up

374
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Cover up

375
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
They sure they've been totally open

376
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
That was the only list that is available

377
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
The list that I just read to you

378
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
And that's over a course of like

379
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
A year and a two years

380
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
They come up with seven instances

381
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Of some deception going on

382
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
And that's just about

383
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Staff members stepping in

384
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
To cover up because their competition

385
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Sucked or didn't work or broke or they couldn't find

386
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Any sexy winners

387
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Oh man, let me tell you

388
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
On the radio

389
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Huh

390
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
How many Z100 in New York

391
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
W HTZ

392
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Shut up

393
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
I'm in the middle of a fantastic thing here

394
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
W HTZ in New York

395
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Number one radio station

396
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
When I did a weekend shift there

397
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
During the

398
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
On was at mid 90s

399
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
No, early 90s I think

400
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Yeah, late 80s early 90s

401
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
We would have

402
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Contest winners

403
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
And here's how it would work

404
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
It would be collar 100

405
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Right now

406
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
On the toll free lines

407
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
One hundred two four two zero

408
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
One hundred two four two zero

409
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
One hundred I even remember the number

410
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
If you can if you can believe that

411
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,800
It's a clear channel station by the way clear channel

412
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Those guys

413
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
And and the instruction

414
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
To the phone ops

415
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Who literally would sit there and go

416
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Z100 or call number ones

417
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Z100 or call number two

418
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
And they would go that way

419
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Up until they hit one hundred

420
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
But they would never say one hundred

421
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
At ninety nine

422
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
They would wait

423
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
And the collar that called in

424
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
They would they were trained to listen to their voice

425
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
This person had to be someone who was going to be excited

426
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Sometimes the DJ would even say

427
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Make sure it's a girl

428
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800
And if the collar was collar number one hundred

429
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Was not did not fit the profile

430
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
The phone op was trained to say

431
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Z100 or call number ninety nine

432
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Try again later

433
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,800
So you might have five or six people who are call number ninety nine

434
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Until they found one that fit the profile

435
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
That person was then collar one hundred

436
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Complete deception this happens all the time

437
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
And mainstream media

438
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Now of course as you know for my own personal view point

439
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,800
I love putting the fuck up people on the air

440
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
I love people who have speech impediments

441
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
And and and weird accents

442
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
And because it's human is beautiful

443
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
I love it that's a big part of what motivates me

444
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
So now onto the interview Michael Grayd

445
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
pompous ass

446
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
I wish you could see the pictures

447
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Is going to tell you that this is because of market pressure

448
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
And bullshit bullshit

449
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
What happens

450
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,800
And this is this is worldwide

451
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Production staff

452
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,800
For I'm just going to talk about television in this case

453
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Our kids the kids

454
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
You know they have no training

455
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
They'll be paying shit because they'll do anything

456
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
You know the blow anybody to work in

457
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Quote television being show business

458
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,800
They're really cheap this is how big profits are made

459
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
And that's systematic

460
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,800
It's systemic it's inherent to the way the business works

461
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,800
You know we've got to pay Jonathan Ross eight million pounds

462
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,800
You know so we got to make up for that somewhere

463
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
By the way when I went to university

464
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,800
I studied broadcasting communications

465
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,800
And there's two things that really got drilled into your mind

466
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Now this was 81

467
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
I believe 82 or something like that

468
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,800
And one is equal airtime

469
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Which of course

470
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,800
When is the last time you heard any talk show

471
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Or watch any talk show where there was equal airtime

472
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
For both sides of a political debate

473
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Well of course that isn't true anymore

474
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Go listen to Rush Limbaugh

475
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Where's the other side

476
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
So somehow that is just that rule that

477
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Regulation has just been thrown overboard

478
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
It pops up once in a while and you know people talk about it

479
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Say well you know there's just no way we can't do it

480
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
All right

481
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,800
And then there was the infamous case of the 64,000 dollar question

482
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
There's been books written about this movies

483
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Remaid movies about it

484
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
And that was all about this deception

485
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Where you could not have a game show

486
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,800
That had a contest knew had the fricking answers up front

487
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Just to draw in huge ratings

488
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
It was deemed illegal

489
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
This regulations about that

490
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,800
It goes on all the time my friends

491
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
So Michael Grayd

492
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Who used to work at the BBC is now going to be a real pompous

493
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
And say oh is market pressure

494
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,800
And then I want you listen very closely

495
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
To a David Cox says

496
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
David Cox long time television producer

497
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
I have a huge amount of respect for the guy

498
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Listen to what he says about television

499
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
And listen to what he says about

500
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
His working with David Grayd

501
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
The man who was right there saying that

502
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Oh this is something of the last couple of years

503
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
That 30 years ago

504
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,800
David Cox and Michael Grayd were deceiving the public together

505
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Well for some perspective on why this has happened

506
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,800
I'm joined by Michael Grayd currently head of ITV

507
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
And formally chairman of the BBC's Board of Governors

508
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
And David Cox, a TV producer and writer

509
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Who formally edited a weekend world

510
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Do you understand why this has happened

511
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,800
I mean why some producers think it's all right to line this way

512
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,800
No, I can't say I do exactly

513
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
I think it's partly to do with casualisation

514
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Of the industry

515
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
People on short term contracts

516
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
100 tremendous strain

517
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
tremendous pressure

518
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Competitive pressure is enormous

519
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,800
Exactly what the BBC is not supposed to have

520
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Is competitive pressure

521
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
And I think the culture has

522
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
You know this is clearly an epidemic

523
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
And it's not just the BBC that's got the problem

524
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,800
I mean I think every broadcaster has got this problem

525
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
So are you looking at

526
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,800
We are waiting for Deloitte to deliver there

527
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Their report on our

528
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Premium phone line problem

529
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
So listen to this

530
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,800
The guy is actually bringing Deloitte and Toosh to investigate

531
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,800
Deloitte and Toosh are the people who actually put the pay lines in place

532
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,800
A different division of Deloitte and Toosh

533
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Actually has all these SMS text divisions

534
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
It's like

535
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Sorry for got to mention that

536
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,800
So Deloitte and Toosh are basically investigating themselves

537
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
In a way

538
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
I don't know what's in it

539
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
But I don't expect to be

540
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Particularly happy about what I'm going to read

541
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
But I don't know what's in it

542
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
You know I'm just thinking

543
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Have you ever seen those competitions on television

544
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Where they have the accountants come in with the briefcase

545
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
And here's the sealed bid

546
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
And oh yes

547
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
This has been protected

548
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
And we have the results

549
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
You know how that doesn't happen anymore

550
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
How you don't see those guys

551
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
You know like when there's a public vote for

552
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Pop idol or American Idol

553
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Or dancing with the stars

554
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
The no longer does that happen

555
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Where the guy says okay

556
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
It's all protected

557
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
And our seal of approval

558
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
You know why?

559
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Because they're in the fucking game with them

560
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
That's why

561
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Um

562
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,800
This precise reason is why

563
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
As the why this is spread

564
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Quite as badly as this across all broadcasts

565
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Not just the BBC

566
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Is it is a function of that pressure

567
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
It's a function of short-term contracts

568
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
It's a function of lack of training

569
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I just I'm at a loss really to understand

570
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Oh man

571
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
This is so beautiful

572
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
It's like the nose is growing

573
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
I think you have a sense of why this is going on

574
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Why do effects

575
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Okay, so now we go to David Cox

576
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Listen to what he has to say

577
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
The same Michael Reds saying all broadcasts

578
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
There's one way or another

579
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Well, I'm not surprised

580
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Mark Thompson says he is

581
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,800
That dishonesty has been discovered in television

582
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
And I don't feel the need that Michael clearly feels

583
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
And Mark is well

584
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,800
To blame the whole thing on some strange short-term factors

585
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,800
And some suddenly have come into play and changed everything

586
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,800
When the industry was once pure and now suddenly it isn't

587
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,800
I think the reality is that television has always

588
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
And way had a culture of deception within it

589
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
It's in the nature of what it does

590
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Almost everything on television is a

591
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Confection of some kind or other

592
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
This isn't really true of other activities

593
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,800
But what television producers have been doing all the time

594
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
When they're preparing a documentary

595
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
The editing footage

596
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
To produce effects that aren't quite

597
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
A raw material justifies

598
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Reality shows up here and you learn subsequently

599
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
That what's happened has been fixed

600
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Drama docs appear

601
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,800
And what they do is they convert the complexities of real life

602
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Into her heroic dramas

603
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
With heroes and unfortunate villains

604
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
But this is a little bit of a screen look

605
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
As if she's walking out of a room

606
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
And she actually was walking into the room

607
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
They didn't do that

608
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Was that prevalent?

609
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Well, I think that if you live in this world

610
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Where fake careers part of what you do

611
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
The borderline between what's reality

612
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
And what's fake

613
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
It becomes very blurred

614
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
And it shifts it shifts

615
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Especially when you're under pressure

616
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
And it's not just nowadays that television people are under pressure

617
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
They've always been under colossal pressure

618
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,800
And faced with the problem

619
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
That you've got to get your program finish

620
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
You've got to get your program out

621
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
The temptation always is

622
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
To push that borderline a little bit further

623
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
And that's what happened with the queen

624
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
But it is it worse now because

625
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
In your view because

626
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Do you hear what the man is saying

627
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
This is a long time television producer

628
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
And I just got to applaud this guy

629
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
For being completely open and honest

630
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
And saying what is?

631
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
And he's not ashamed

632
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Which he shouldn't have to be

633
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
But by Gali, let's not pretend

634
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Let's not cover this up people

635
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
To take the specific case of the BBC

636
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
The BBC is trying to do too much

637
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
And therefore it's inevitable

638
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
If you have much more quantity

639
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
You will have much

640
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Ah, I can't wait until you hear what he says about Michael Greed

641
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Perhaps a dilution of quality

642
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
And you wouldn't have the editorial control

643
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
She had when there's only a couple channels

644
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Now it is hard

645
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
The editorial lines of Quran

646
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Quite long these days

647
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Particularly with an independent sector

648
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Although you cannot lay the blame for this

649
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
And Tali on the independent sector

650
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Because a lot of these things are in house

651
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
BBC problems anyway

652
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
But the talent moves around

653
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
They don't love them on short

654
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
The talent moves around

655
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Because you pay them shit

656
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
You pay them shit

657
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,800
And they're completely indispensable

658
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
In country

659
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
When you want to do that, give them short-term contracts

660
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
So here's the reason why

661
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
You have a television program

662
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
You have people working on it

663
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
What happens if the show

664
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
All of a sudden fails

665
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Or has to be taken off the air

666
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,800
You're left with the staff of 30 to 50

667
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Maybe even 100 people

668
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
You don't want those long-term contracts

669
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
That you can't get out of

670
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
That's why everyone in television

671
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Is freelance

672
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
So you can fire them

673
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
When the show goes off the air

674
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Or the season ends

675
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
It's how it works

676
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Don't give me this shit

677
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
That is part of something new

678
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Of the past couple of years

679
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Term contracts

680
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
It is the pressure

681
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Yes there's always been temptation

682
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
I agree with David

683
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
The temptation is always there

684
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
But I agree with you

685
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
You're successful in the past

686
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Resisting that temptation

687
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Somehow the pressures were less

688
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Yes there's pressure of course there is

689
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
But the skills and the crafts

690
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
That go into making television programs

691
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Are now being used

692
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
To cross a line

693
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
There is a line of deceit

694
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Deliberate intent

695
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
To deceive

696
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
And that's a line

697
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
That I have never seen cross before

698
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
If that's true

699
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Can you put Humpty Dumpty together again

700
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Okay so

701
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
He says that this is something

702
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Just of the past few years

703
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
And I just gave you a couple of examples

704
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
From my own experience

705
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
From 25 years ago

706
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,800
It has been going on forever

707
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
And it's unraveling

708
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Before our very eyes

709
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
It's very very important

710
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
That we pay attention to this

711
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
And use this

712
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Because the spectacle has now turned

713
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
On to the media itself

714
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Where the media

715
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Typically

716
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Creates the spectacle about someone else

717
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Now the spectacle is on itself

718
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
And because of all the competition

719
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
You're going to see

720
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Everybody

721
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
All these stations

722
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Going to be killing each other

723
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
And we have to feed the beast

724
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
My friends

725
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
If we want to make independent media

726
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Interesting

727
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
And compelling for people

728
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
As an alternative

729
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
To what they're being spoon fed

730
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
And what they're now finding out

731
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Is a bunch of lies

732
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
And trickery

733
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
And crap

734
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
We have to propel this

735
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
We've got to throw gas on the fire

736
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
The public quite right

737
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
They are going to be very skeptical

738
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
Everything

739
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
They see on television

740
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,800
Now can you rebuild that degree of trust

741
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
With all television channels

742
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
But particularly the BBC

743
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
You depend on public trust

744
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Otherwise there would be many money

745
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Oh and this is so incredibly important

746
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
This is why it's a big deal

747
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Because the politicians

748
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Politics knows

749
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
They know

750
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
That if the people don't trust the media

751
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
Then that is their vehicle

752
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
That's how politicians communicate

753
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Then people will not trust them

754
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
So this is going to be a huge issue

755
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
It's going to be so big

756
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
Television is going to get incredibly

757
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Boring

758
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Well actually I believe this will happen

759
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
I think it's a matter of culture

760
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
And I think it goes back a long way

761
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
And Michael I worked for you 30 years ago

762
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
And we used to get up all kinds of stuff

763
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
And don't pretend

764
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
You don't go about it

765
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,800
I don't think I will

766
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
But

767
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Okay

768
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Did you just hear what happened

769
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
This producer said Michael

770
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
You guy

771
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,800
Formerly boss of BBC

772
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
I presume when he was the boss of the BBC

773
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
Of the chairman of the Board of Governors

774
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Or whatever

775
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
We deceived the public

776
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
He said it right there

777
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Then the freaking news night interview

778
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
He was saying

779
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Well you could told us about that

780
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Then of course David Cox

781
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
I think wisely says

782
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Well I'm not going to go into it right now

783
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
But

784
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
Where's the follow-up interview

785
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
I believe he has to tell us

786
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
If Michael Grade was involved in deception

787
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
When he was at the BBC

788
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
That needs to come out

789
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
And I'm going to make a call out to everybody

790
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,800
And I know there's producers who listen to this show

791
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
I know that there are people who've been in audiences

792
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Of programs, television and radio

793
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
All mainstream

794
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Listen to the show

795
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
I want you to blow the whistle

796
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
I want you to call in

797
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
I want you to tell me what happened

798
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
And we're going to publicize this

799
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
This can be a huge deal

800
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Particularly

801
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
If this happened to you

802
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
In the United States

803
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
We have to fan the flames

804
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
This is part of the revolution

805
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
If you really give a shit about what we're doing

806
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
About independent media

807
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
An alternative

808
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
And something that certainly has more chance

809
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Of being more transparent

810
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Has less ulterior motives

811
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Than mainstream media

812
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
It is your duty to come forward

813
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
You can do it anonymously

814
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Of course

815
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
The truth is that culture is changed

816
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
And they change very fast

817
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
And they change in the face of dramatic events

818
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
I mean smoking

819
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Was something that was part of the culture

820
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Almost overnight

821
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
It's become unacceptable

822
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
And I think today's events

823
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
In themselves will be sufficient

824
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
To change everything

825
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
In the television industry

826
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
And people in the industry

827
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Will have to start treating the viewers

828
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
Straight in the way that they haven't in the past

829
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
It's going to happen

830
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
And it won't happen

831
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Because the BBC's guidelines will get much thicker

832
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
Which of course they will

833
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
It will happen

834
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Because everybody working

835
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
In any part of the industry

836
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Will just know things have changed

837
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
They've been rumbled

838
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
And they've got to change their ways

839
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
In crises like this

840
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
So

841
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Now standby

842
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
Because he's going to tell you

843
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Why it's unraveling

844
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
And why the BBC no one

845
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,800
That ABC NBC CBS CNN

846
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
The Fox News BBC ITV

847
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
No one can stop it

848
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Because the genius out of the battle

849
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
With horror stories

850
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Like today's story

851
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
And others that know that

852
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
Will come out and stuff

853
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,800
We've seen before

854
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
From Channel 4, Channel 5

855
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
And our ITV

856
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,800
You will only restore public trust

857
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Through the means by which you handle

858
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
The affair

859
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
The BBC Trust today

860
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
As behaved impeccably

861
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
As it was meant to do

862
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,800
I think the honesty and the open

863
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
And prompt disclosure

864
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
By the BBC of the problems

865
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
They found

866
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Will do much

867
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
To repair

868
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Public trust

869
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
But it's quite clear

870
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
From what Mark Thompson said

871
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
That he knows he has to deliver

872
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Within a few months

873
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Quite likely

874
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Of course

875
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Of course

876
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
And we're all trying to handle this

877
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Are you partners

878
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
As open and transparent

879
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
A manor as possible

880
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
It's the only way

881
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
That you will quickly restore

882
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Public trust in broadcasting

883
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Which is crucial for

884
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Have you asked your staff to come up with

885
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Yes indeed

886
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
They are feeding it

887
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
We've got a whistle blowing line

888
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
They've got a drive

889
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
The only whistle blowing line

890
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,800
You need to know

891
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Or the ones you know at the call

892
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
That's right

893
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
If you're in the States

894
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
And you know of some trickery

895
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
Or fraud on mainstream media

896
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
You've got to let us know

897
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
And the UK

898
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
Here's your number

899
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800

936
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,400
The BBC All Broadcasts could do is just open up everything and say this is how we make television programs.

937
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,600
This is a genuine bit of a concoction as you put it earlier and this is a confection and this isn't.

938
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Yes, I think that's going to happen, but partly it's happening because the viewers are working it all out for themselves.

939
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,200
They're much more aware of how the business works and they used to be.

940
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,200
They look on YouTube and see the inner workings of everything and the viewers are going to make this happen.

941
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,000
The pieces should do nothing that they don't want to read about in the newspapers tomorrow.

942
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
There you go.

943
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Do nothing you don't want to read about in the newspapers tomorrow.

944
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You pussies.

945
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Excuse me.

946
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,800
Oh, man, I'm riled up about this.

947
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,000
So, I want to expose all of this and you know what?

948
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,800
I'll come up with a million more examples from my own world.

949
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,000
No problem.

950
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,400
Geez, Louise.

951
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
You know, MTV.

952
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,200
Oh, yeah, we've done so much trickery, so much deception.

953
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,000
All in the under the guise of well, that's entertainment.

954
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,800
That show business.

955
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Oh, I'm all right.

956
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
I need to just relax for a second.

957
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
I don't think I'm going to do anything else on today's show.

958
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,800
But let's just find lies with some good jersey vibes from the Hesh.

959
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,400
Here's your Todd Nyer notes about this guy.

960
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,800
So I'm like a country by Hesh, but I'm in at the side at a time that sounds.

961
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:28,600
As students come to the can and join and we'll never turn and back.

962
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,600
You know the past that died to me in Jerusalem.

963
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,200
You know, just a show that I'm playing throughout the world.

964
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,200
You know, you know, you shouldn't say anything.

965
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,000
Oh, I don't know where they came in.

966
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You know, there's a moment and if they're our first discovery,

967
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,200
you'll have great battles showing what's up.

968
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,200
You've been told to sing this way.

969
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:03,000
Who's the only stress and fear it's always on yet your heart ain't strong.

970
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Through your sins and wilders and extreme badms,

971
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
when they know what they're tall,

972
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
we can speak and shoot to me whenever I say.

973
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
When I'm not going to tell you, it's through the same day.

974
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You've been so surprised to know that I'm playing throughout the world.

975
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You've been saying that.

976
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I tell you, so long you won't say,

977
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
it was my favorite.

978
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I know, I'm not a father yet.

979
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
You show me that you've lost the things that feel.

980
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You show me the moment and you'll be there.

981
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yet you won't feel this is what never happened in your days.

982
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,600
I couldn't understand why I was such damn shame.

983
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:20,000
Came isn't backward, després respect them and banch the specializzoned back yard.

984
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I think nothing is on, better crash if it re varied.

985
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Oh I have beenasing me about some cartoonish and lame.

986
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Is love starting it's way more happening amusing he may when I know that he rose because I'm,

987
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,760
I think there's the album for me, it's gone so I'll give you reason

988
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,320
To tell you something about it, I'll take it on the road

989
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,360
Wait, stop it for the shoes and get it

990
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,760
It's the way I've never dreamed of something like that

991
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,600
There's miss and love who's ever come on here and they say

992
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,960
It's rock and roll, promises have all faded away

993
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,280
I used to believe I still wanted to believe

994
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,680
But it might already sound damn hard

995
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,680
I still didn't know how it was when I never imagined it

996
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,960
I went to the bars and it backs, we just didn't do it

997
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,240
I fall up there, there's nothing to say

998
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,680
It's been looking for him, passing out

999
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,680
I still rang it, they're finally in the mirror

1000
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,680
I waited so long, I said, thanks for the reason

1001
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,680
You didn't move so fast

1002
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Show me your heart, you're kidding, that's a strong

1003
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,680
Something that you raised me

1004
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,680
Bruce

1005
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,680
Oh man, this guy is good

1006
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,680
He gives me the same vibe, Bruce gives me

1007
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,680
The fourth instance of our Springsteen guy straight

1008
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,680
Southside Johnny, oh crap, what's up with that?

1009
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,680
It just ends like that, probably flows through on the album

1010
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,680
Alright, so I'm just going to leave it at that for today

1011
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,680
Because I've said enough, I'm counting on you guys

1012
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,680
To call in, give me, I'll give you another one

1013
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,680
Do you know the program TRL, TRL live?

1014
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,680
Which the predecessor to that was total request live?

1015
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,680
The predecessor to that was something called dial MTV

1016
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,680
Every single day, weekday afternoon between

1017
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,680
I think it was six and six, 30 or five, 30 and six

1018
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,680
I hosted a program called dial MTV, phone lines are open

1019
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,680
One, 800 dial MTV, all you have to do is call in

1020
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,680
And vote for your favorite video

1021
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
And you know what happened?

1022
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
No, what happened?

1023
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,680
The list would come down from some magic call center

1024
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,680
Go to the office, to the programming department

1025
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,680
And then we'll come down to us

1026
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,680
So those of you who really got sick of seeing new kids on the block

1027
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
Which by the way, I like the new kids on the block

1028
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
I just want to set the record straight

1029
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
But you know what's seconding, every single day

1030
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
They were like number one, they would literally change

1031
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
The number one video to something else

1032
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
They would lie because they were sick and tired

1033
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,680
And then people were calling up and saying stop playing new kids on the block

1034
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,680
They would do that, they had nothing to do with the voting

1035
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,680
So if you've witnessed this, it is your duty

1036
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,680
You got to do some duty, it is your duty

1037
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,680
To call in and tell me about the deception you were involved in

1038
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,680
I promise you I'll protect your identity if you want to do it

1039
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,680
Anonymously, but it's even better if you'll come forward

1040
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,680
And you probably probably more people were victim

1041
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,680
And just involved in it and not actually the mastermind of it

1042
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,680
This is our chance that's a crack in the armor

1043
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Let's really really make them bleed

1044
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,680
Because we can show the world that there is an alternative

1045
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,680
They're ready, they're starting to lick that red pill

1046
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
Let's push him

1047
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,680
DailySourceco.com, Adam at podshow.com

1048
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,680
Tomorrow we'll do some cheddar

1049
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,680
Another podshow podcast, stick it in your ear
