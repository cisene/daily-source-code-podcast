1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Potion needs you to help us suck the less.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, I'm getting sick of it too.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I have this sprint with Potion Radio.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The bottom line is this.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
As soon as this shows over, go over to suckless.potion.com.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Get in, get out, and for God's sake, get out with your life.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Because if you don't...

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Help us suck less help us suck less potion.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Eat you to help us suck less.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hello, out of this is Frank Electrolox.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You know, in my industry, you'll want to suck as much as you can.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So I really don't give my hands around this suck less thing.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I keep hearing it everywhere.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
suck less suck less.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't get it.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
More suction is a very good thing.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You need to understand the basics.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And you're confusing the kids.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They need to understand that it's okay to suck.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But no, you've got this big promotion suck glass.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And now everybody's singing the songs.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And doing all kinds of things.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
All they're doing is talking about suck glass.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What do they like it or not?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So in the DSC 614, can you shed some light on this whole suck less thing for me?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Frank Electrolox.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Thank you, dad.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But in the next generation radio content in my ears.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Fantastic, it's Adam Curry.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I can feel your heartbeat.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I know you're lonely.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can tell you by the way you hide you right.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I can feel your heartbeat.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I know you're searching for something to read me into your life.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Just another night in your city.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Face is on the ground.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We have a blue.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Everyone is searching for somebody.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But nobody has a clue.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Just another night in your city.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All along the dark night.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We have a blue.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Just another band was chasing music.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And it all stopped.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
When I saw you.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can feel your heartbeat.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In the night our eyes meet.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And it seems like we were always meant to be.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I can feel your body shaking.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We touch you in the embrace.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And love works for you.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
They tell you by the way.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Just another night in your city.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Face is on the ground.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We have a blue.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Everyone is searching for somebody.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But nobody has a clue.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Just another night in your city.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All along the dark night.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We have a blue.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Just another band was chasing music.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And it all stopped.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When I saw you.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Just another night.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Just another night.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Just another night.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Just another night.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just another night.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Just another night.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Just another night.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Just another night.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Just another night.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Just another night.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Just another night.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Just another night.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Just another night.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Just another night.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Just another night.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Just another night.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Just another night.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Just another night.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Just another night.

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Just another night.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Just another night.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Just another night.

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Just another night.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Just another night.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Just another night.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We have a blue.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Just another night.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We have a blue.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Face is on the ground.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We have a blue.

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Everybody searching for somebody.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But nobody has a clue.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Just another night.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Just another night.

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Just another night.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Just another day.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Just another night.

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Just another night.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Just another night.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Just another night.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Just another night.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Just another night.

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Just another night.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And just another night.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Just another night.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Just another night.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Just another night.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Just another night.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Just another night.

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Just another night.

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Just another night.

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Just another night.

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Just another night.

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Just another night.

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,800
Trisha there with her star sisters and just another night in New York City soon to be

121
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,000
Podsafe available on iTunes.

122
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,200
Yeah, and she's binding to a big time into the Podsafe Music Revolution.

123
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,800
So here we are once again in the big Apple and well, what a day it's been so far.

124
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,900
Got up at the crack of dawn.

125
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,000
In fact, Dawn actually had already cracked.

126
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,500
No, Miss Selly, not talking about you.

127
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Dawn cracked. It was a 530.

128
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,000
Got picked up at 630 off to the airport.

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Man, I was just completely wrecked.

130
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,000
And of course, it's because of a lot of activity over the weekend.

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A lot of intense flying that went on.

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,500
So, you know, it does take a lot out of you.

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,500
Let me tell you, it's no picnic.

134
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,000
Next time you're flying and you walk by that cockpit and the pilot standing there with a flight

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
attend this thing.

136
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,000
Because it doesn't matter if you got auto pilots and, you know, it's just it's intense work.

137
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,500
It really is work.

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,200
But it's a lot of fun.

139
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,500
As you can tell, I've got the, got the mobile set up all installed here in my hotel room,

140
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,200
which is not the first thing I did getting off the plane.

141
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,200
By the way, completely uneventful flight as usual.

142
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,200
It wasn't the regular version Atlantic 747.

143
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,200
It was an airbus, which is the what the 320 or 340.

144
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
I get confused with the airbus numbers.

145
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Why is my mic so soft?

146
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Oh, ow.

147
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Did you hear that?

148
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Sorry about that.

149
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Yeah, so you have a little less room and the configuration is,

150
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
isn't quite as cozy.

151
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
I quite sure what it is.

152
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,200
It's not the same as the big massive manly 747.

153
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
I didn't look at any of the movies, although there were a couple of ones.

154
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,200
I want to actually want to see music and lyrics, but I know Patricia wants to see that,

155
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,200
so I'm not going to watch it and we'll get it on DVD and we'll watch it together.

156
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
There really wasn't anything that I needed to see per se.

157
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,200
So, what a couple of magazines, you know, started some trashy novel book,

158
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
which was good for a couple hours of entertainment.

159
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
I arrived in the hotel.

160
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Now, I got here around 1230 and my first meeting was at 2 o'clock.

161
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,200
This is the way we roll a man's like boom.

162
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,200
When we get out, I just discovered, I mean, a big mistake here.

163
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,200
I've positioned the computer on the left hand side of the microphone

164
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,200
and the mixer on the right hand side.

165
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Usually I'd have it exactly the other way around where I control the volume with my left hand.

166
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,200
And I operate the computer with my right.

167
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,200
It's not that hard to operate the mixer with the right hand,

168
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
but the computer and the trackpad was left.

169
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
That's like, I took an idiot pill.

170
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Okay, well, we'll get through it.

171
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Upon arrival, all of a sudden,

172
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,200
messages started going off the email, my phone started ringing,

173
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,200
and those of you who follow curry.com,

174
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,200
or I put a Twitter tweet thing out.

175
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,200
I think I might as well get the word out ASAP.

176
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Someone hacked into one of our servers.

177
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:24,200
And was able to send out at least one message to a number.

178
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,200
A lot, not all, but a large number of members of podshow.com.

179
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:38,200
And there's just been hours and hours of work on this.

180
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,200
And everything is okay now.

181
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,200
In fact, when we think it's a guy,

182
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,200
but someone who spills his name as monkey backwards,

183
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,200
probably came in from Germany.

184
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
But that's just the first stop we got.

185
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,200
He's used all kinds of proxies and spoofs and stuff.

186
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
But the minute he was in and started doing stuff,

187
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
which he did very quickly,

188
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,200
we were immediately able to isolate the server that he was on.

189
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,200
And basically, watch him while he was doing things,

190
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
which were no longer on a live server.

191
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
And that's, I'm kind of paraphrasing it.

192
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
And obviously there's a lot of information I have that I just,

193
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
I'm not going to tell you on the show,

194
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,200
because I'm just presuming it's a he.

195
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Why do we always presume that malicious hackers are he's?

196
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
How malicious was he?

197
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
You know, it's okay.

198
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
So he sent out an email, big joke.

199
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
I think he tried a second one,

200
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200
but that didn't get very far because but then we had,

201
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
we blocked the mail server.

202
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
The mail server, it's always the mail server.

203
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,200
I'm telling you, my experience.

204
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
That's, you know,

205
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
and I don't, you know,

206
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
we have some special kind of mail set up because

207
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
if you send out a lot of emails,

208
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
and we don't really send out a lot of emails,

209
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
but for verification we do.

210
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Every day there's,

211
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
hundreds of not thousands of verification emails going out.

212
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,200
And you can be deemed a spammer pretty quickly by,

213
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
you know, AOL or hot mail, etc.

214
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,200
So you basically have to pay a company like strong mail.

215
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
A lot of money.

216
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
I mean, I shit load a money.

217
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
It must be at least $100,000 a year.

218
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
It's probably more than that.

219
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
So that, you know,

220
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,200
they ensure that you're on the whitelist of all of these,

221
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,200
of all of these different big mass email providers

222
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
where people have accounts.

223
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
So, you know,

224
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
it's a custom configuration and, you know,

225
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
and it's just vulnerable.

226
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Send mail is,

227
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
we've always had,

228
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
and I know,

229
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
please geeks and nerds don't email me telling me that,

230
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
you know,

231
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
it's all about how good you are.

232
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Because of course,

233
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
it's all about how good you are.

234
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
And there's exploits everywhere and everything.

235
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,200
But it seems that just about everything,

236
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
everything was contained.

237
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,200
I don't think we had any downtime on the site.

238
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
There was some funky DNS stuff for a little while

239
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
where you might type in daily source code.com

240
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
and output pop geek brief for something completely different.

241
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
But, you know,

242
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
congratulations to the ops and the tech team for,

243
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
for, you know,

244
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
identifying isolating,

245
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
tracking because of course,

246
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
that's the fun thing is when you,

247
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
you know,

248
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
when someone's on your system

249
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
and you're able to isolate him or her

250
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
and watch what they're doing without them,

251
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
knowing that you're doing it,

252
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
which I think we did for quite a while.

253
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
So,

254
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
we learned a lot about our system today.

255
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
So I appreciate everyone,

256
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
everyone being,

257
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
being to call about it.

258
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
I don't know,

259
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
it's something,

260
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
it's something car lolling,

261
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
cumbre.

262
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
You probably going to be aware of this,

263
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
but I've just had about six emails

264
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,200
telling me that pod shell has been hacked

265
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
by something called

266
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
eeknome or something.

267
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
So,

268
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
you've started,

269
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
you know,

270
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
the email address is,

271
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,200
email address he's using his hacked.by.e

272
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
nom.podshow.com

273
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
and the body of the email is podshow.com.

274
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Got hacked.

275
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
So maybe you could tell us what's going on.

276
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
I'm sure the show's in the network is safe,

277
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
but just want to tell you

278
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
a two soon out or by the way,

279
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
I am a folding screen.

280
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Goodbye.

281
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I like the way you put that man.

282
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
I'm sure the network is safe.

283
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Yes, the network is safe.

284
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
We're okay.

285
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Oh my goodness.

286
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,200
So that was the fire drill.

287
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Do you or is that the typical New York hotel room

288
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
with the air conditioner blast in a way?

289
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
It is warm in New York.

290
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
It's actually quite nice.

291
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
I'm sure it's leaves today.

292
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Going from meeting to meeting.

293
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Of course, this is the quarterly visit to New York.

294
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,200
We work with the big brands directly a lot.

295
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
But once a quarter we go to New York.

296
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,200
And in fact, this time we're calling it the doors.

297
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
We are the doors.

298
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,200
It's the digital online opportunity road show.

299
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
And we do a little show.

300
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,200
And show people what's going on with the independently produced media.

301
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Also known as podcasting.

302
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,200
And some of the campaigns that have been very successful,

303
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,200
not just for the audience who have had a lot of fun with the products and services

304
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
and participating.

305
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,200
And there's been a couple of them think of Earth Lincoln.

306
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
And I dog but also Splenda.

307
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
You know, Tyler and all PMs.

308
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,200
There's a lot of big brands that we work with directly.

309
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Have great case studies.

310
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,200
People are in the advertising community are looking for.

311
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
You know, this engagement.

312
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
It is still the word here on the street.

313
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
We're looking for engagement.

314
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
And actually, I was thinking about it today in a conversation we're having.

315
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Where, you know, you guys, audience out there.

316
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,200
You love being a part of the shows you listen to.

317
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,200
That's essentially, I call that an audience.

318
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,200
A responsive audience that is a part of the show.

319
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Advertisers and marketers and Madison Avenue.

320
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,200
They collectively talk about consumer or customer.

321
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,200
I think it's consumer engagement is what they talk about the most.

322
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Well, so there you go.

323
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
That's an audience.

324
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
You want to be engaged.

325
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
You want to be a part of the show.

326
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,200
A part of everything that I talk about or whatever.

327
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Your favorite shows are about.

328
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,200
And it's the same thing that drives people.

329
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I believe, you know, to unmasse.

330
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Start texting to vote for, you know, shows like American Idol and similar formats.

331
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
It's a way of participating in the show.

332
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
It's a very crude way I'll have to say.

333
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
You know, it's all you get to do is basically vote for one person.

334
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
But you know that your voice.

335
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,200
And that's even questionable with these, you know, SMS scams.

336
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
If you've been following what's going on in the UK,

337
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
it's.

338
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Man, your vote doesn't always get counted apparently.

339
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Or your vote doesn't count because the contest is already closed.

340
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
But thank you for your dollar fifty.

341
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
But that's a form of participating, participating in a show.

342
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,200
And kind of a mini community, a little solar system that you're a part of.

343
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,200
So it's really, you know, that is showing what people want.

344
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
You're a control of your, your own entertainment.

345
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
You're a control of your iPod.

346
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200
So controlling is just one part of what we love to do.

347
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Being part of it and contributing.

348
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
I love doing that.

349
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,200
I love messing around with, you know, getting on other people's shows and

350
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,200
and talking shit and making stuff happen.

351
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,200
It's maybe it's just a human DNA thing that we like to do that.

352
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
So let me do it right now.

353
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Let me participate in something Dawn and Drew put together.

354
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Now, you know the story where I popped this song like two or three days early

355
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
was a big muck up.

356
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
I'll totally take the blame for that.

357
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,200
I wasn't, I wasn't paying attention.

358
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
And they shouldn't have happened.

359
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,200
But it don't matter because all's well that ends well.

360
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Ziggy Marley has put into the groove.

361
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Track from his second solar album up on the pod safe music network.

362
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,200
So that any any podcast or where they're doing a video podcast,

363
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,200
audio podcast if you're streaming.

364
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Anyway, you want to use this.

365
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,200
It's all falls under the pod safe music license.

366
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,200
All you have to do is of course report back to the network when you played it.

367
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,200
And if you want to hear more from the man himself from Ziggy Marley,

368
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,200
who I met briefly on one of my many trips at Jamaica,

369
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,200
one of which was a documentary I was at Hope Road.

370
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:20,200
And then later at the HQ at Marley HQ,

371
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,200
I think that's where Rita lives.

372
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,200
And you just met him briefly in passing.

373
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
It's a very cool guy.

374
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Great interview.

375
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Dawn is like so far up his shrink.

376
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
It's not funny anymore.

377
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
But of course the guy's writing songs for her.

378
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
So you know, might as well do something like that.

379
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Check it out now.

380
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Ziggy Marley.

381
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Funny how it's also a title of Madonna song.

382
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
I think I like this one a little bit better.

383
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,200

To the floor, where love grows, do you have eyes?

415
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Yeah, to the floor, where the sun disappears, but a light's in shine.

416
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,200
To the floor, surrounded by the waters of desire.

417
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:24,200
To the floor, where love grows, do you have eyes?

418
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Can't you wait?

419
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,200
You need to sleep.

420
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:40,200
If you mind sleeping to your mind, there's nothing you can't change this time.

421
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Can't you wait?

434
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:33,200
Oh, I want to go back to Jamaica and all of a sudden.

435
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Oh, my favorite vacation destination.

436
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Ziggy Marley, into the groove, you'll find him on the pod safe music network.

437
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Do you guys, we just hold on a second.

438
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
I'm going to check something here.

439
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
There you go, that's better.

440
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,200
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.

441
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Okay, just messing around with the set up here.

442
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Hey, okay, let me see.

443
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,200
The seat now, all of a sudden, I forgot what I was going to talk about.

444
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I'm sorry, I'm a little bit jet-like.

445
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
What's the time right now?

446
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
It's 10.30 pm.

447
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
It is still Tuesday.

448
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,200
So that's about 3.30 in the morning, body time.

449
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,200
You know me, it doesn't really matter.

450
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,200
Wherever I lay my hat, I just don't know if I'm hungry or not.

451
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
That's what I can't.

452
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Maybe I'll have some like macadamia nuts or something.

453
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,200
You know, they feed you pretty well on the virgin flight.

454
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,200
It's just, yeah, it just gets all messed up.

455
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,200
You know, so we're in New York and we're promoting some things.

456
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
And this isn't official.

457
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
This is an NDA.

458
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
This is not a damn announcement.

459
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,200
But it's just something that I've been working on in San Francisco.

460
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,200
And I'm really proud of what it's turning out to be.

461
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
It's, you know, just have a listen to this.

462
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
If you've got a game, we've got the channel for you.

463
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Pod Show Sports.

464
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Join Legendary Sports and Command.

465

Run bar on the newest and hottest all sports entertainment network.

466
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
As he brings the games to the fans.

467
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Jim, you're in Chicago.

468
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
I was so mad.

469
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
I almost threw my TV out the window.

470
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
From golf.

471
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
This game is going to drive me nuts to the grid.

472
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
I can't believe it's going to play better than we did.

473
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
From the ring.

474
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Frank and California.

475
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Thanks for climbing through the ropes.

476
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Long time no talk.

477
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Yeah, Ray Ben.

478
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
To baseball.

479
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Go ahead, John.

480
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Listening on the internet in LA.

481
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
I hate the giant.

482
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
And fans.

483
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
It's just a youth thing.

484
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
And a music.

485
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Yeah, right.

486
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
From body building.

487
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Body doing things.

488
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200

489
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
You're seven times.

490
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200

491
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
We thank you very much.

492
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Then Bob.

493
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Thank you.

494
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
You're pro wrestling.

495
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
I gotta give you one more thing.

496
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
What's your gonna do, brother?

497
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I'm gonna be a broke while on you.

498

And that found a crazy podcast.

512
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
So sports.

513

Bring the game to the fans.

514
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
John, you're in Dallas.

515
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Like a rock.

516
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Bring them on.

517
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
They're going down.

518
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Hell yeah.

519
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
I'm no sports guy.

520
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Okay.

521
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I don't know anything about sports.

522
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
I watch like the world series.

523
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
I'll watch the playoffs.

524
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
I'll watch.

525
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,200
What is the basketball championship?

526
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
I'll watch all that.

527
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
I don't know anything about sports.

528
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
But this, this gives me.

529
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,200
A little podcast or wood.

530
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
And now.

531
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm currently in daily source code, listener.

532
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
For something completely different.

533
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
So what was going on?

534
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
I didn't know what was happening.

535
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
The Gary Hoggander from the ultimate podcast.

536
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Ah, we're on sports, right?

537
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,200
The new episode that I just uploaded actually is an exclusive that I was given from one of

538
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,200
a five, one of the finest of the, you also find championship name, Stephen Monner.

539
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Stephen was basically kind of convicted of using steroids.

540
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,200
I guess the positive for steroids used during his last fight.

541
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,200
And it was a false positive.

542
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,200
And basically there was a huge, huge black ball thing going on with him.

543
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,200
And a lot of people really dog in the mountain, given him bad name.

544
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Seven kills to come on my show.

545
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Just straighten that out.

546
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,200
And if you listen to the new episode of the ultimate podcast, you'll hear this guy.

547
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Telling his story to anyone who'll listen.

548
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:49,200
But also letting us know that the major marketing, how list that we have.

549
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,200
You know, as we all know here, for the podcast in the world,

550
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,200
are really not doing us, are not, you know, in my case, fighters.

551
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,200
But are news, the people who are making it, you're not doing us justice.

552
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,200
You know, they're feeding us what they want, what they want to hear.

553
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,200
And they just proves the point that independent podcasting is really the best source of any type of,

554
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
of entertainment and news that you can get.

555
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,200
This guy is actually able to tell his story with his words and his mouth.

556
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,200
And not having to deal with, you know, people riding down something that doesn't work.

557
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
So I hope you guys check that out.

558
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
The ultimate podcast.

559
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
The new episode is up now.

560
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,200
You can check it out at the ultimate.podshow.com.

561
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
Yo, yo.

562
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
I'm going to agree and disagree with you there.

563
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,200
You know, first of all, look in the newspaper.

564
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Find an article that you actually know something about, that you really know something about.

565
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,200
The best example, of course, is in your case, ultimate fighting.

566
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,200
But really, it's podcasting.

567
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,200
When you read other people's truth.

568
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,200
And I don't believe in the whole, you know, mainstream media is out to get us thing,

569
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,200
or, you know, or there's mass manipulation going on.

570
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,200
It's, everyone has their own version of what they think happened.

571
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,200
And man, I've seen this for 20 years.

572
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,200
You know, I'll, uh, someone will write something about me or a situation that I,

573
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
that I was either in or I know about.

574
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
And like, that's not how went down.

575
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,200
That's, that's not what, you know, whether it's good or bad, doesn't matter.

576
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
It's not, you know, it's not all negativity.

577
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,200
It's just like, no, that's just not what happened.

578
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Remember I read that MTV book?

579
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Uh, yeah, there's a big ass book, big ass writer.

580
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,200
I got it from a big ass person as in, as in stature in the business community.

581
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,200
And it said the Adam Curry from Australia, you know?

582
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
It's like, yeah, it's the way it is.

583
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
It's just the way it is.

584
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,200
And how many times have I said not to say something on this show?

585
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Well, I was convinced that, you know, I knew what I was talking about.

586
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
And I get corrected by you guys.

587
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
It happens all the time.

588
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Something interesting at Pod Show HQ in San Francisco.

589
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,200
We have, and there must be a scientific name for this.

590
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
But we have doubles.

591
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
We have at least four people named Chris.

592
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,200
We have multiple people named Brian.

593
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Multiple people named Kevin.

594
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,200
We have, I mean, seriously, multiple people.

595
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Let's see, we had, well, Pod Pimp is gone.

596
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
So we had multiple errands.

597
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,200
And now we have, oh yes, it's a typical Pod Show thing.

598
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
We have multiple atoms.

599
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,200
In this case, we got a new guy on the scene, Pod Show HQ.

600
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,200
A to the B, his name is Adam.

601
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,200
And he's, I think his official title is,

602
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Manager of campaigns.

603
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Savant do compying you.

604
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,200
And the first campaign he got to manage right off the bat.

605
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,200
And he kind of fell right into the middle of it was,

606
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
the sockless campaign.

607
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Go AC, what's up, man?

608
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
It's A to the B.

609
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
Hey, I just wanted to give you a quick,

610
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,200
sockless update after my first week in Pod Show.

611
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
So far, the feedback has been fantastic.

612
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
The survey results, the traffic patterns,

613
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,200
all the qualitative feedback and the logosphere.

614
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
It's been phenomenal.

615
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,200
So just wanted to say, hey, we really appreciate the listener taking that.

616
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
That's what it was.

617
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Now, thank you.

618
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
I'm just going to back that up.

619
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
A to the B.

620
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,200
It was quantitative feedback from the blogger sphere.

621
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
I'd like that.

622
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Let me do that again.

623
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
That was fantastic.

624
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Hold on.

625
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Here we go.

626
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
The qualitative feedback quality.

627
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
The qualitative feedback quality.

628
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
It's been phenomenal.

629
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,200
So just wanted to say, hey, we really appreciate the listener taking part in this and participating.

630
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Also, a quick public service announcement.

631
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,200
We've got a Godzilla, golden retriever near the Pot Show HQ.

632
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Bring a plastic bag with you when you take your dog out for a walk in the morning

633
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,200
because I almost hit this gigantic steamer left in the middle of the sidewalk.

634
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Like a landmine.

635
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
All right.

636
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
Appreciate it.

637
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
And the background track is Cersei,

638
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
a soul sucker.

639
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
And it's from the O.S.

640
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Music Network.

641
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Take it easy, AC.

642
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Talk to you soon.

643
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Now, I think every Pot Show employee should be doing feedback comments like this.

644
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Sounds like you were using.

645
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Well, maybe it wasn't using cast blaster.

646
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Sounds like a Mac program.

647
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
I can almost feel it.

648
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Hey, man.

649
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Thanks.

650
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Welcome to the show.

651
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
A to the B.

652
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Yeah.

653
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,200
By the way, there is another name for the suck less zone.

654
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,200
We also have the same URL is a superpanel.podshow.com,

655
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,200
which is really a better descriptor of what we're trying to accomplish by creating

656
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,200
a huge panel of listeners and podcasts.

657
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:49,200
There's a like who wants to participate in multiple surveys that are about podcasting in general independent productions.

658
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
There will be a lot about advertising.

659
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:58,200
You'll be asked to look and listen to multiple versions of advertising.

660
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,200
I mean, I'm enjoying.

661
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Well, the first survey was, you know, it was like a, I've taken surveys like that before.

662
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
But of course, it was about podcasting.

663
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,200
So that was kind of fun to go through everything.

664
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:19,200
I am very much looking forward to the advertising, to the advertising parts, which I think we're going to do one a month or something like that.

665
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
So join the superpanel.

666
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Superpanel.

667
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
That podshow.com.

668
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Hi.

669
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
I made a script today.

670
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,200
I just wanted to say I love the new hit tests.

671
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
It's great.

672
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,200
And I tell you, I'm going to keep up the good work.

673
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Also, as it's Monday morning, second traffic.

674
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,200
I'm going to make some, to make some more confidently exercise.

675
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
All right.

676
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Cheers.

677
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Bye.

678
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
As we need.

679
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Car friendly.

680
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Asor size.

681
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Amy, do we need car friendly?

682
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Asor size.

683
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
How do I do it?

684
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
I certainly hope she hears it.

685
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,200
I could use some of that myself because that laying on the ground and chairs and

686
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
jumping up to the ceiling.

687
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
I'm right there with you.

688
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
All right.

689
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Where we at 30 minutes.

690
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Good.

691
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
I'm going to play another song for you tomorrow.

692
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Just tons more meetings, obviously.

693
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,200
So you probably won't get a show from me until tomorrow night.

694
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Your results may vary due to road weather conditions.

695
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:21,200
And of course, the time zone in which you reside from mashuptown.com.

696
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,200
This is like two of my favorite songs mixed together.

697
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,200
And two guys who used to be in a band together called,

698
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
What was that?

699
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Genesis.

700
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Sledgehammer in the air is still common to be the Gabriel.

701
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Mashed up.

702
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:08,200
If you don't stay on your tracks, you could have me playing.

703
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,200
If you're free, don't subscribe.

704
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,200
I know it's coming.

705
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,200
I've been in a pain in me.

706
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,200
I've been in a pain in me.

707
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,200
I've been in a pain in me.

708
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Do you have a pain difference?

709
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,200
We've got a lot more on this.

710
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Do you think I'm on the wrong path?

711
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,200
There's a mirror that's never in me.

And in the air tonight, I'm only missing one thing in this matchup, I'm going to hear it again.

750
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:33,200
So in the air tonight has this fantastic one of the most famous drum riffs, where Phil Collins goes,

751
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:41,200
I know if you know this song, you know what I'm talking about, and that's not in the mashup.

752
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,200
That's the only thing I really missed, otherwise fantastic from Ben Double M, mashuptown.com.

753
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,200
All right, tomorrow I'll be right here, deadly source code dot com, out of at podshow.com.
