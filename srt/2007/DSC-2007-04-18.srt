I don't know exactly what to say, I hope you find a way to come out of the closet.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want you to wait a second, I didn't sound right.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I hope you find a way to escape from Mark.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hey, you've got to believe this.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I had nothing to do with all of this.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There's no way I would turn on my own boss.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No way, believe me.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If there was some way, anyway, I could help you get out of the closet.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I would do it.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll keep listening.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Call me when you're ready to come out of the closet.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I love you.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Big, here's the bag.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Even if your phone's my bag.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I had a, this is your favorite purple dinosaur stopping by to tell you that I want to put my fist in your ass.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm going to be in the Bay Area next week, and I was hoping to binge you over a table and pump you harder than a Mexican oil.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Got it, good day!

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's sing another song, shall we?

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Adams, ass feels real tight.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I could bang him day and night.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, Adam Gurney, thanks for spending time with me.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Maybe next time you can come over some afternoon for cake and crumpets.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And I can tea bag you with my big purple coin purse.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ooh, good day, good day.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That would be great.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Bye-bye.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
See you later.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh yeah.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000

Day, if you get to California, we can stay in LA.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Will we question you in Venice?

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Like my brother, buddy, there's a man.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's gonna kill you on that apartment.

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,080
It does. He's got a bleep filter on his fucking computer here on his rig.

56
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,260
So any time he says, you see Ray? Oh my god.

57
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,200
That's fucking crazy. Oh my god Paul.

58
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,900
Nah, actually I can't take that person.

59
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,300
You think his rig came preset with that?

60
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,200
He's after factory setting.

61
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,200
It could be. Oh my god. Hold on. Wow. Wait a second. You see. Oh

62
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,280
What if you say it in Spanish like what what happens if you say it in Spanish?

63
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,720
Let's see. Oh radio del

64
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:03,840
Oh shit. Oh my god. It's multi-lingual. Wow. Oh my god. I can't you what maybe I'll try to say fast. You see a really

65
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,560
See? That's amazing. Wow. It's amazing. You cannot say you

66
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:21,040
Show on the daily source code. Oh my god. Hold on. I need to get one of them. Exactly. Oh my god. Hold on. Wait a second.

67
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,480
You know what? That's just got to be a setting in here. Wait a second. What time?

68
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,280
It's probably a switch. Yeah. Let's see. Hold on. Check over there by the switch for the disco wall.

69
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,480
Yeah. Wait. Here's the voice masculinizer that he's got set. Okay. Hold on.

70
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,080
Uh blah blah blah. Wait. Here we go. Try this. Yes. You see rates on the

71
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:51,120
s**t altar. So let me click on that. Okay. Now if I say it, right? Good. You see rate.

72
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,880
Jersey turned that Jersey. Jersey turned. Oh my goodness. Thank you. Look at her Bible.

73
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,360
It is so huge. She looks like one of those police guys. Girlfriends.

74
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,160
But I want to stand those police guys anyway. They only talk to her because it looks like

75
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:20,960
Mother Teresa. Okay. I mean look at it. It's huge. It's gross. She looks so

76
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,160
right since. I like big bubbles and I cannot lie. You pretty

77
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,160
Now that when a girl walks in with a KJB and a bookmark in Proverbs, you get to stokes.

78
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,160
You got a naming race that you know this girl is saying. It looks like one of those

79
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,040
large ones. With money and space in the margins. Baby, I want to re-witch her.

80
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,160
Here's your Bible's got pictures. My minister tried to console me but that book you got makes me so

81
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,560
holy. Oh my my me. Yeah. You're second one. Coin a knee. Yeah. Will bless me. Bless me. It takes me

82
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,720
about John Wesley. I saw her praying while I was eating. She got breaks. She's pretty

83
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,840
face. She ain't going down to the bad place. I'm tired of even guys singing they like

84
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,880
pocket size. That's the average Christian to take a look. She got a pack much book. It's so

85
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,560
fellas. Yeah, fellas. Yeah. The girlfriends got the book. Oh yeah. Well read it. Read it. Read it. Read it.

86
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,560
Read that holy book. Baby, I'm in. I feel the ribbon mark.

87
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:34,240
Baby, I'm in. I'm in. So that was a clip from Baby God book. Which is something that we

88
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:43,680
found on Christian YouTube clone. God tube. Thank God for God too. There's a God tube.

89
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:51,760
God tube. It is. It is. It's the Christian YouTube. And first of all, Mike, I got to say,

90
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:59,200
I'm not sure I want my God from a tube. Well, I anger God if I squeeze it from the top and not the

91
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,160
bottom. I mean, I don't. I think it's probably not possible to squeeze it from the top of the bottom.

92
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,080
I force you to squeeze it from the middle. Yeah. Because I want to make sure I get every last drop

93
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:18,400
of God out of the God tube. It doesn't come with an easy applicator stick. I don't know.

94
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,360
I mean, is it for painful, uh, itching and swelling? I see. I don't understand. I mean, I guess,

95
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,920
okay, I do understand. I mean, I do. Well, YouTube is such a phenomenon, right? Yes. But there is so

96
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:40,640
much, a quote, sinful content. You have sinned on YouTube by posting those videos of you

97
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:48,640
rupturing a testicle. I mean, that's it. Yeah, I just don't see a reason to watch video on the internet

98
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,640
if there isn't the possibility of boobs being enrolled. I think there are a lot of boobs involved.

99
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,040
Yeah, that's true. It's a different type. Yeah, I mean, that's very true. Well, here, here's,

100
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:07,040
here's a perfect example of one of the boobs that you'll see here on God tube. Hi, Charlie again.

101
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,840
This week, we want to deal with definitions of terms. So, of course, the first thing to start out with,

102
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:21,360
if we're trying to deal with a subject scientifically, is define that word science. Science is not

103
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,520
science because somebody that wears a lab coat who's called himself a scientist does it,

104
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,640
but it's because it is sensible. Meaning you can feel it with your five senses is repeatable

105
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,640
and it is only in the present. If we take something in the present that we can really look at,

106
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,960
take a woodpecker for instance, a very interesting bird. If you try to think about how could it

107
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:52,560
woodpecker evolve, slowly change from a different kind of a bird into a woodpecker,

108
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,880
you kind of stuck with a few problems. First, let's just look at how possibly a woodpecker could evolve.

109
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,960
His bird flying along one day and he sees a bug land on a tree. And so he decides to climb in,

110
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,520
you see the bug climbing into the tree and he says, oh, hey, man, there's dinner. He likes that

111
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,360
particular kind of bug. So he runs up there, bangs his head, his beak into the tree. And of course,

112
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:24,960
drives his beak straight back into his brain. So that was a little audio clip from a video on

113
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:32,000
God Tube called argument against evolution. And the guy has like oscilloscopes on the table to make

114
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,200
you think he's some kind of like scientist or even educated. And you know, they don't even,

115
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,520
here's the thing, they don't even pan down during the whole clip to show if he even has shoes.

116
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,280
So I don't know. The subtitle chatting with Charlie chatting with Charlie about evolution.

117
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:58,320
I mean, here's the thing. It's like, you know, he's talking about his first, and within the first

118
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,960
30 seconds, right? He says that science, science, true science is really only what you can see in

119
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:12,000
the present. Okay, here's here, quote, a scientist, Charlie the scientist talking about how,

120
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,280
you know, I guess you can only prove what's in the present, right? So like the Charlie the scientist.

121
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:25,440
Yeah, Charlie the scientist. Charlie the Christian scientist says, you know, but if you can only prove

122
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,600
what's in the present, if we can only grasp and understand that, which is in the present,

123
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,680
then what the fuck are we supposed to make out of stories? There's supposedly happened 2,000

124
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,040
years ago. I mean, come on Charlie. That's a good point. I mean, you know, here's the thing.

125
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:49,520
I just look, I think it's fine that they, you know, Christians, evangelical Christians want to

126
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:57,600
find some sort of outlets to put their crazy, you know, videos, they're on the web.

127
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,920
There's a hierarchy idea. There's a hierarchy idea. There's a great one actually I saw on

128
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,520
YouTube. It's actually it was done by a church minister. It was back in the like the 80s because

129
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:16,560
it was apparently shot on video. And it was, if you're a Christian clown, how how to act when you

130
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:25,040
visit a nursing home? Are you serious? Oh, it's amazing. It's absolutely amazing. It's, and they

131
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,600
show these clowns and they go this nursing home and how like, you know, um, you know, away from a

132
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,760
far because some people are afraid of clowns and then they show these old people, you know, who are

133
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,400
acting like that they are going like, you know, in terror of these Christian clowns, you know,

134
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,640
and it's always like spreading the faith through clowning in nursing homes. I haven't been doing

135
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:53,280
that for thousands of years. But the thing is that was put up as a joke on YouTube, right?

136
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,640
So you've got, you've got baby got book on God tube, right? Which, you know, you see,

137
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,320
you see the guy who's doing, I'm going to put links to these. I, you have to. No pun intended

138
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,840
swear to God. I got, I'm putting links to these in the show notes. You know, the guy, the, the MC,

139
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:18,400
the pastor, whatever, youth pastor, youth minister. He's like trying to be like a rapper and he's

140
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:28,960
got this giant gold thing with his initials on it. You know, around his neck, like, like he's

141
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,400
trying to be like some street dude or something like that. Hey, you know, street for Jesus. Yeah,

142
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,920
the thing I loved about the chatting with Charlie is that he goes through that whole explanation

143
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,200
about the woodpecker. Yeah. And first of all, his facts are wrong. He said they can pick 400 times

144
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,680
a second. That's way off. But he basically proves create our evolution. He talks about,

145
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,000
he talks about how the beak is developed to do a specific thing and the tongue does something

146
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,480
specific and the saliva works together with the tongue and how it's, he's, he makes the argument

147
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,240
for evolution. I love it. And I've watched a couple of his other videos. He does the exact same thing.

148
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,080
You know, just pick an animal and he's, he has argued against the evolution of that animal

149
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:20,560
while proving it. I love, I love, I love scientists Charlie. Oh my God. That's amazing.

150
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:27,200
It is amazing. And look, I have no problem with anybody's faith. Here's the thing. What I love

151
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,320
is, you know, his whole big thing is he's going to disprove evolution because, you know, God forbid,

152
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,280
you believe in evolution or evolving or that man came from apes or that there were dinosaurs

153
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,640
who roam the earth 50 million years ago. You know, see, what I love is that one of the

154
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,720
main tenants of every single religion, right? Of course, is tolerance. You know, even true Islam

155
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:56,160
preaches tolerance. Right. But most people, most people take that as tolerance of anyone who believes

156
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,960
exactly what they do and nothing else. How glad you pointed that out. Yeah. I love that. I love that.

157
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,600
You know, and so instead of, you know, basically it's just, it should redefine and say, I'm

158
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,120
tolerant of me. Yes. Anybody who is not me, I just don't have time for you. Then you must die.

159
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:24,640
You must die flaming ball of of hate. So that's, I mean, in Los Angeles, right? We have a

160
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,280
Jewish sponsored museum of tolerance, which, which, you know, in right there in West LA, right

161
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,160
on Pico, which I tried to go to once, but I got into a fight in the parking lot. I make it there.

162
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:47,120
So, you know, that didn't work out so well. But, uh, what are you know, actually, to tell you the truth,

163
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:57,200
I am starting a new video sharing a social network site with my rabbi called, uh, called YouTube.

164
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,480
YouTube. Yeah. So right now, it's actually, it's all circumcision videos. And, and I've, I've actually

165
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,800
got the, uh, some clips from the Goldstein bar mitzvah, the Goldberg bar mitzvah, the Goldberg

166
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,320
bar mitzvah, the Goldbergstein bar mitzvah, and actually a video where Jersey Todd shows his tail.

167
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,480
So, yeah, and I got some, I got some stuff off the Bluper reel from the electronic press kit

168
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,840
released by the Jews who controlled the media. Right. So, yeah, you know, we're, we're hoping to get some more

169
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,640
clips there. It's going to be huge. It's going to be huge. YouTube, man. I'm telling you. Yeah.

170
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:40,560
How are you spelling that? With a G. Yeah. Okay. But, you know, I, I tell you, as, as entertaining

171
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:48,400
as YouTube is, God, tube is, is, is even more entertaining to me. Yeah, definitely. Yeah,

172
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,960
especially, you know, because I'm, I'm like, uh, you know, I'm going, uh, there's got to be some

173
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,880
good stuff on here. You know, they're not going to post like clips from any of the sitcoms or any,

174
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,400
any, you know, daily show clips are going to show up on God, tube. But I did find this. It's,

175
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:13,840
it's a clip. I swear George Bush left a clip on God, tube. Check this out.

176
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:24,720
Good evening. This is George W. Bush. I'd like to take this opportunity here on GodTube.com.

177
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,400
Let's tell you my story with regards to my personal savior and Lord, Jesus Christ. There have

178
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,520
been times in the past when late at night. Jesus was sneaking into my room and trying to put

179
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,240
himself inside of me. But I was not ready to take him in. I was young and unsure. But now,

180
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,200
with the war in Iraq region, I've decided that it's time to let Jesus inside of me through each

181
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,120
and every opening I have to offer. Now late at night when I hear Jesus enter the room,

182
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:00,320
I grip my teeth, roll over and wait for his glorious love. Quietly, I can feel the hands of

183
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,840
Jesus on my body as he gently, yet firmly takes me by the shoulders and slowly enters me.

184
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,800
Make no mistake about it. The Lord's love is not easy. In fact, it's hard, like a stone.

185
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,960
And it's long, like a baby's leg without any. I love to feel the Lord forcing his love,

186
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,960
his deep, deep love into my soul through every hole he gave me.

187
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,560
Quiet frankly, there are times when I find myself choking on the love of the Lord. But that's

188
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,760
when I hear Mama's voice in my head, tell me to breathe through my nose, loosen up my throat

189
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,080
and start praying. It'll be over soon. And then when the Lord has done filling my empty vessel with

190
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,320
his love, quiet often, I will try to return the favor by showing the Lord my love. But he will not

191
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,080
allow it. The Lord is such a giver, but he thrusts my face back down into the pillow and he puts his

192
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,640
love into me yet again. Over and over, I can feel the love of my Lord ramming through my soul,

193
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,360
Ian and out and in and out until the Lord's cup runeth over and I feel him pulsate with joy.

194
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,200
There is no truth to the song we shall overcome, as Lord has so many times told me that he cannot

195
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,360
overcome when it comes to my soul and salvation. So I look forward to him coming and coming again,

196
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,880
over and over, filling me with his love and his redemption. This is your President George W. Bush

197
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:38,480
wishing you a good night and God bless America. The commander in chief on god, how inspirational.

198
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:48,640
I know I moved. Yes, I'm quite moved, actually. About 6 inches this way. So Serious 102 listeners,

199
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,680
you're going to have to go to dailysourcecode.podshow.com to listen to the rest of the show

200
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:06,680
And give me a call on the PCH comment line, 1-800-875-0995, or email me, at where's Adam Curry at gmail.com, or Adam Curry's gay at gmail.com.

201
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Your choice.

202
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,680
So, uh, one or two listeners trust me, you're so missing out.

203
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,680
You got it down low the rest of the show.

204
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
We'll catch you later.

205
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:25,680
The only big program at your command is the only big program program.

206
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Hello, Mr. Namco. This is the prolific program.

207
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:37,680
Now that you are in charge of the DSE, I thought it might be time to address my nickname.

208
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,680
I'm not sure I knew how I came to be known as the prolific programer.

209
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,680
prolific means I'm capable of reproducing.

210
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:54,680
I'm equipped for reproducing, but that doesn't necessarily mean I am capable if you know what I mean.

211
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:01,680
I believe Adam often uses the word prolific when he actually means profound.

212
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,680
But then English is not Adam's primary language.

213
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:14,680
I was wondering if you could make me a new theme song as the profound programmer, which fits me much better.

214
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:22,680
Oh, and tell Adam that his thoughtful gift came the day after the autograph picture.

215
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,680
But I don't know which end I should use.

216
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,680
They both look the same.

217
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,680
Well, bye for now.

218
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,680
So, uh, Mike, I don't know, do you have a big plans for the summer?

219
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
No, nothing yet.

220
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,680
I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

221
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,680
Well, here, wait a second. First of all, I got to tell you.

222
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:59,680
I'm fascinated with the public's fascination with San Jaya.

223
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,680
Yeah, I'm not sure what that's all about. I think it's his hair.

224
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,680
Well, he does have, he does have very nice hair.

225
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:13,680
But it's, it's amazing to me that people are more fascinated with San Jaya than say Nicole Kidman, right?

226
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,680
And I mean, I think I almost understand it because here's the thing.

227
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,680
Someone like that, she's so beautiful, right?

228
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,680
The most women know that they'll never look like her.

229
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:31,680
You know, even after they lose 50 pounds and Midwest women, I'm talking to you.

230
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
So, I know what.

231
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Yeah, I know what we're talking to you.

232
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Yes.

233
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,680
And I mean, San Jaya is so average, right?

234
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,680
I guess that people identify with him.

235
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,680
And you think that's it?

236
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,680
You think it's the every man aspect?

237
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,680
I think so because he's not so talented that people say,

238
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Wow, I, um, that, that, there's no way that could be me.

239
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,680
I think he's so untalented people are like, you know what?

240
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
I could be that guy.

241
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
You know this?

242
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,680
So we're, we're shooting for the lowest common denominator here.

243
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Well, it is American Idol.

244
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,680
And I mean, okay, you know, I'm following this, right?

245
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Because I'm a student of weird news, right?

246
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Okay.

247
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,680
I, um, I found out San Jaya's parents, I swear to God, this is true.

248
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Mm-hmm.

249
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:23,680
We're a harshness according to divorce papers that were filed by his parents.

250
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,680
And that's what divorcing each other, divorcing him.

251
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
Yeah.

252
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,680
They were divorcing each other.

253
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,680
And apparently the father had become a, a hard Christian, a, a, a, a, a, a minister.

254
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,680
Priest, whatever they do.

255
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Shaman.

256
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Shaman.

257
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Yeah.

258
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
And don't squeeze the shaman.

259
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:47,680
And so he was living in the temple or the shed, the little tool shed, the hard Christian tool shed.

260
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Mm-hmm.

261
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,680
And, you know, he was, uh, not making any money.

262
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
He declared zero when his tax return.

263
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,680
And I guess, you know, eventually it's some point.

264
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
That creates a problem with the family.

265
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
Sure.

266
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,680
You know, so that there was a whole thing and they were divorced.

267
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,680
And then the papers, it's mentioned a whole higher Christian.

268
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
So he's brought up like a hard Christian.

269
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Wow.

270
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Yeah.

271
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
I didn't know that.

272
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
So that's why I think he's so popular.

273
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,680
He's getting the hard Christian a vote.

274
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
Yeah.

275
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
So.

276
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
How are they calling in?

277
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Uh, you know, I don't know.

278
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
I think what happens.

279
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
At least, I don't, I don't have phones.

280
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
And I think he has something else.

281
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
They're using their mind power.

282
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
They're high Christian of mine power.

283
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Which happens.

284
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Skype by mind.

285
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
Skype by mind.

286
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,680
You know, which they're eating special lentils that have been irradiated.

287
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
I don't know.

288
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,680
But I thought as Sanjay, it, I think what it is to is Sanjayia.

289
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,680
It's just a fun word to say.

290
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
It is a fun word.

291
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
It's true.

292
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
It sounds like a musical instrument.

293
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,680
You know, almost like because you got the, like banjo.

294
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Except Sanjayia, I think, would be a wind instrument.

295
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,680
So like here, let's use it in the sense.

296
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Hey, Mike.

297
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
Yeah.

298
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Dude, I went to your recital last night and you blew a mean Sanjayia.

299
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,680
Well, thank you.

300
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,680
Yeah.

301
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
See, that's, that's what I mean.

302
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
It sounds like a wind instrument.

303
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
It does.

304
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,680
Or you could use that same sentence and name your penis to Sanjayia.

305
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
It's the worst.

306
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
It does.

307
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,680
It sounds like maybe the new, the new SUV hybrid from, uh, from,

308
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Kia.

309
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Exactly.

310
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
It's a Kia Sanjayia.

311
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Kia said, Jaya, 40 miles to the gallon.

312
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,680
So all the instruments are in India.

313
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
It's all in Hindi.

314
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Hindi.

315
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
Oh, yeah.

316
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,680
The speedometer reads like, you know, right to left.

317
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Exactly.

318
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
So.

319
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Is that right?

320
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
Yeah.

321
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
I don't know.

322
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,680
So, you know, you have to pull up to the pump where it's, you know,

323
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,680
regular, unlettered and tendori.

324
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
So you have to pull up to the last pump.

325
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,680
But, uh, so here's the thing.

326
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,680
So I think what I'm going to do.

327
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,680
I'm so fascinated that this summer, right?

328
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
I want to be more like Sanjayia.

329
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,680
So I'm, I'm going to go to American Idol Camp.

330
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
You know, it was a fruity.

331
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
We're going to say that.

332
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
I mean, did you see this story?

333
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
I did.

334
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,680
On the edge.

335
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
It was actually on the today show.

336
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
It was like national TV.

337
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Oh, my god.

338
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,680
So free mantle media, the company that created American Idol.

339
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Uh, you know, this billion dollar, French, multi-billion dollar worldwide franchise

340
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,680
is creating a camp for American Idol Camp.

341
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
I am not making this up.

342
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
That was speechless.

343
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Yeah.

344
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
Today.

345
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
And actually today.

346
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
Oh, my god.

347
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
Oh, my god.

348
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,680
As soon as we finish the show, because I got to get online.

349
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Because today is the deadline to apply it.

350
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
I don't camp.com.

351
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
Really?

352
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
Yeah.

353
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,680
And, you know, if first I wasn't going to, I wasn't going to do it.

354
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Because, you know, I'm Jewish.

355
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
I don't do camp.

356
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,680
But, um, you know, I, I, I'm, I'm drawn to it.

357
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
I, I think I have to do it this summer.

358
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
I think you'd be good at.

359
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
You went to Berkeley, right?

360
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
Yeah.

361
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
Yeah.

362
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
So it was almost like there tonight.

363
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,680
I don't camp.

364
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
Yeah.

365
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Exactly.

366
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,680
So, uh, Mike, I'm, I'm kind of hoping you would, you would come with me.

367
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,680
Be my camp buddy.

368
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,680
Yeah.

369
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
I would go.

370
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
We can share a bunk.

371
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
Well, not.

372
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
I didn't, I don't know about that.

373
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
I don't know about that.

374
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,680
I don't know about what you want to say.

375
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Look, that's, you're making it much worse.

376
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,680
Yeah.

377
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,680
Yeah.

378
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
How about those dodgers?

379
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,680
Exactly.

380
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Yeah.

381
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Yeah.

382
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
I don't camp, huh?

383
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Yeah.

384
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
I don't camp.

385
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
So, um, and, you know, there's no doubt.

386
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,680
And this thing's going to be so popular.

387
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,680
I, I hope that I can actually apply.

388
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
That's not too late.

389
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Because, you know, this country has, uh,

390
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,680
uh, this country has American Idol fever.

391
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,680
Which I believe can only be properly treated with leeches.

392
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Uh-huh.

393
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
But, uh, heard that.

394
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Yeah.

395
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,680
It's unbelievable.

396
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,680
So, uh, um, American Idol camp.

397
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,680
If you're going to go, uh, I was just noticing they have scholarships.

398
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
Oh, dude.

399
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,680
So, you can probably, and I'll bet you can get one.

400
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
I'll bet you'd qualify.

401
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Do you think I could get the, uh,

402
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,680
Bucky Covington scholarship?

403
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,680
For sure.

404
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Why not?

405
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,680
A full ride.

406
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,680
See, I'd be afraid of, you know, if somebody like,

407
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,680
oh, you're, you're getting the full ride at American Idol camp.

408
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,680
And I'd be like, does that involve Ryan C. Crest fist?

409
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
Yeah.

410
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,680
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I'm going to have to pass on that one.

411
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Just polish up with a strap on.

412
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,680
Yeah, exactly.

413
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,680
So, I might just, I might just actually pay in that case.

414
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,680
And tuition is a very affordable $2,900 for the week.

415
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
That's not bad.

416
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Yeah.

417
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
For the week.

418
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Yeah.

419
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
But there's a way to mean it.

420
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,680
You go to camp to learn how to win on American Idol for a week?

421
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
That's, that's it.

422
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
That's, that's it.

423
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
That's it?

424
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
That's it.

425
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Yeah.

426
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,680
That's it.

427
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
That's it.

428
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
That's it.

429
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,680
That's it.

430
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680

So

482

I don't know American idle camp. It's kind of it frightens me it frightens me a lot

483
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,840
I have a frightens me. Yeah, you know me all these camps we've got Jesus camp

484
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,200
Got American idle camp. I'm not really sure which one is worse

485
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,040
They both involve small children some type of fisting. I'm sure exactly

486
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,240
And oh the pimp camp. Well, that's right. Remember. Yeah, I think what's gonna happen is we've we've signed a deal

487
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,520
It's not gonna happen this summer. Well, it might happen to some we you know because it's kind of one of those things where

488
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,960
Where it's uh, it's gonna it might be a little fly by night, but

489
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,720
Watch out PCH Pimp camp

490
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Is opening up soon and

491
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,440
You know and you get it you get a t-shirt and a hat with that as well you do you get t-shirt and a hat and you know

492
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,920
It's it's all about you know wallet making and host slapping

493
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,440
So and you know sitting around the campfire at night with your you know 40 ounce or in a bag and

494
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,040
You know cold 40 sing in you know such great

495
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,400
Pimp camp songs like a bitch get me my slippers

00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,360
And bitch kumbaya

497
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,160
Right, so uh, yeah, I think PCH Pimp camp is gonna be a fucking hit did

498
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,520
It's cheaper than I don't can it's much cheaper because it's 2895

499
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,240
Yeah, and we do take a cut though

500
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,720
We as we do take a cut of all profits over the next three years. Yeah. Oh, I thought you mean you were gonna cut me like I'm gonna cut you

501
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,360
No, no, no, because that's our slogan actually at PCH

502
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Can't I get a cut you bitch?

503
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:10,640
So uh, yeah, I'm kind of hoping I'm kind of hoping so uh we can we can get that going because uh is that it's slogan on the new shirts?

504
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,600
It better be so it's also all right, but um, oh fuck

505
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Did you hear that?

506
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
Yeah, dude. Oh

507
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,720
Did we forget to lock the closet door oh? Oh my god

508
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,680
I was in there trying on on his wife's clothes

509
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,040
No, I think oh, I think Adam got out. Oh shit

510
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,840
Dude. Oh, that's sorry. We do. What do you mean what do we do? We have to fucking go chase him

511
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,040
Don't we have to find him. Why? Why?

512
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Because I mean

513
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,640
I think we let him run around gilford for a while. You think well, I think we got I think we got to find him because I personally don't have to

514
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:05,680
I don't want to have to answer to what what is conspired here over the last few transpired

515
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,920
conspired or was transpired over the last year? Yeah, I had nothing to do with that. Yeah, exactly. So um

516
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,600
Yeah, I do we got to I mean come on. You'll take his time and how hard could it be to find

517
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,680
7 foot tall guy running around gilford in a gimp outfit?

518
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,840
Well, that's a good call. We are an angle. Yeah, we aren't gilford. That's true. It might take a little time

519
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,960
To find the right guy. So, okay

520
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:42,400
All right, well, I still got him. Yeah, we got our afternoon cut-out for us. Oh, wow. That's true. Okay, and then after that we get some bangers and mash

521
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,120
I hope that's some kind of food

522
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Me too

523
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,840
Oh, man, all right hold on. Let me play this

524
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,840
Oh

525
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,440
Mark, let's go on there and dance out as soon could be sweet to show you it pardon me there

526
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,840
We're just getting ready for the holiday that is coming up on Friday

527
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,960
You know what holiday if you don't Adam knows what holiday I'm talking about

528
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,120
Yeah

529
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,640
Yeah, anyway

530
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,520
Yeah, I was in fact silence when I called in yesterday

531
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,600
Although because I podcast the revolution I have

532
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,880
Vustily resisted my captors and dances

533
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,240
No resisting is like make a choice is worse later

534
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,160
But anyway, I have broken free long enough to call you and hope that this call doesn't get interrupted

535
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,720
I believe that's true that I was talking about the legalistic versus the moral of the components to the

536
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,280
debate about pirating music and I mean the reason that we in the public get

537
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,480
views about this is because it is legalistic and moralistic in the courts of course

538
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,080
It is only legalistic and it's a lawyer lawyers to decide

539
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:03,120
You know what's legal what's not and I'm talking yesterday about well it's illegal because of the power of the lobbying

540
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,120
Organization that is the IWA

541
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
But in the public sphere

542
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,840
Laws aren't quite as they are is weird, but they're not quite as meaningful

543
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,920
So we have a debate that includes the legal and which is kind of subtle that's illegal

544
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:27,280
But we feel more we're justified in taking things if we feel as though we've been screwed for 1895

545
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,320
We know that artists don't make money from those CDs

546
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,160
We know that and we know that this quote unquote piracy has occurred because

547
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,600
The 1895 sticker prices on into lobbying and not into

548
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:49,360
paying the artist so we feel compelled almost to take something at the top on a major

549
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,080
Dan Dan where'd you go?

550
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,760
Silence again damn you Doug Morris stay away from Dan Patterson

551
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,080
Hey Mark great job filling in for AC not sure I could stand another best of curie week by the way

552
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:10,320
As for your question of where this independent music thing is going well who knows what I see are independent bands

553
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,840
Complaining that they are being shut out of the marketplace and now they want to stick it to the man

554
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,720
But then when these same bands then get an offer from the same man

555
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,240
They forget their past and don't want to be independent anymore

556
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,680
So the cycle only stops when independent bands can make as much money as the band signed to labels and the only way they will

557
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,440
happen

558
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,000
Is if we all stop trying to be like 13 year old girls and

559
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:44,560
Gossip about who likes what and if you don't like the bouncy puppy hip-hop group or you you listen to your caramel

560
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:51,760
a kitty rapy group so you must suck oh come on and grow up but you see each of us just wants to be cool

561
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:58,400
And most of the time we use music to show how cool we are and thus we succumb to the music industry

562
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,280
By letting them tell us who to like so we can brag about how we like bouncy puppy hip-hop group or whatever and oh

563
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:11,440
We don't like her melancholy cat rap group. Oh who cares? So I'm not sure whether the strangle hold

564
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,720
By the music industry execs will ever go away

565
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:23,120
For me I listen to a lot of different music even Christian music and thus created the pillar cast for people who just want to hear music with a purpose

566
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,080
And now the bunch of messages. Yeah, does it make me cool? No, I doubt it

567
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:34,880
But the music I played doesn't have to make me cool. So I don't care what the music industry says and I don't care what you think either

568
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:41,520
Hey Mark, keep up the great work. Thanks from John at the pillar cast hi John it's male from Megalophone

569
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:48,160
I've been listening to your tape for the 19th time. Oh, that's another call. Can I call you back when I

570
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,720
In a band

571
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,720
I

572
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,280
You

573
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:43,620
Hi Jack, it's L from A and I, you don't really need a band, they are in the way.

574
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:50,300
We only wanted you anyway, so don't you band, it's you are the base, you better wake us up fast,

575
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:58,300
This is not a game, we're a professional, we did, I mentioned you better, you should be out of this year.

576
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,300
Can't I be healthy?

577
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,300
Go!

578
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,300
Back to the communication, right?

579
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:08,300
To think that you were a cowboy, we were all kind decided to be out of New Collin's door.

580
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:13,300
Come on, so let's end the past and see this journey for my child.

581
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,300
I play this here, good time.

582
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,300
Jack, you are Jack, you are shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.

583
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,300
Are you a priority?

584
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,300
Name this journey for your life.

585
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,300
I'm going to be a star.

586
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,300
Jack, you are just a joke.

587
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:33,300
Do you want a hit of this?

588
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,300
Thank you, John, from the pillar cast for those comments.

589
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:11,300
You bring up some really good points, but I think ultimately what happens is a lot of independent music artists.

590
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:18,300
They will sign that big record deal because it allows them to quit their day jobs and become full-time musicians,

591
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,300
at least that's what they believe it means, though it doesn't often work out that way.

592
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,300
And a little song, a little ditty, I've just played.

593
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:33,300
Kevin Gilbert, from Shaming of the True Wets, basically what's I call that suit fugue, dance of the A&R man.

594
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,300
I thought it just kind of fit.

595
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,300
Wasn't really planning on playing more Gilbert, but just fit.

596
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,300
And let's see.

597
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,300
Then actually relating to that.

598
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:47,300
Slaw, our good buddy, Slaw, right since it's just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed Monday's

599
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,300
DSC that you hosted, cracked up so many times, which normally listening to Adam while I'm following what's going on

600
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,300
in the Podger world, and I'm usually not bursting out into belly laughs.

601
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,300
I don't know, I usually laugh when Adam can be funny.

602
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,300
He could be funny.

603
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,300
Anyway, I was also completely surprised when he got into Kevin Gilbert, one of my favorites.

604
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,300
I didn't know you went to Berkeley, will you?

605
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,300
Yeah, whatever.

606
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,300
Berkeley's not so cool.

607
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:17,300
And yeah, I was fascinated about the Kevin Cheryl saga while reading the book no fool to this game,

608
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,300
a Cheryl Crow biography, which, yeah,

609
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,300
I, you know, it might be interesting.

610
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,300
I might check that out, Cheryl Crow biography.

611
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,300
Like I do an outline for me, because I have trouble with that one.

612
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:33,300
See, the only, the only part, the only chapter I'm interested in is I guess they suppose it lesbianism.

613
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,300
Really?

614
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:40,300
Yeah, because, you know, there was a story going around for a very long period of time that she was a lesbah.

615
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,300
So, yeah, so, yeah, I would be interested.

616
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:48,300
Yeah, you know, if the, in between the chapter of where she fucked over her boyfriend Kevin Gilbert,

617
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,300
completely fucked him over.

618
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,300
If there's a whole chapter about munching rug, then, you know, I'll read that.

619
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,300
Cheryl munching rug.

620
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,300
So, I'll then that it, it does me no good.

621
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,300
But, yeah, that's the name of the chapter.

622
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,300
Munching rug.

623
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,300
My month of rug munching.

624
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,300
I, hopefully it's more than a month.

625
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,300
Yeah, I'm hoping half the book is about rug munching.

626
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,300
Okay.

627
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,300
So, yeah, I don't know.

628
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,300
Maybe there's somebody out there interested in this.

629
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,300
You know, let me know.

630
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,300
If there's, you know, just paraphrase the rug munching chapter for me.

631
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,300
Just give me the, the cliff notes version of it.

632
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,300
We're sent pictures.

633
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,300
Yeah.

634
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:25,300
And this got this email from Bob, who sent it from a commuter train in Tokyo,

635
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,300
a Bob son writes in,

636
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,300
Hi, Mark, what a shock here I am looking forward to.

637
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,300
We're relaxing 40 minutes with Adam.

638
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,300
And I hear you.

639
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,300
Oh, no.

640
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,300
PCG has kidnapped the DSC feed.

641
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,300
All getting aside.

642
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,300
Good show.

643
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,300
And I'll probably survive.

644
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,300
So.

645
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,300
I'm about here.

646
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,300
Yeah.

647
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,300
And I hear you.

648
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,300
So, uh, thank you, Bob, son.

649
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,300
And, uh, you know,

650
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,300
definitely, uh, keep yourself safe from Godzilla attack.

651
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,300
They're in Tokyo.

652
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,300
That's price.

653
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,300
I love that.

654
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,300
Oh, man.

655
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,300
I love that.

656
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,300
You know what I love?

657
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,300
There was a couple of comments.

658
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,300
People left on the DSC page.

659
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,300
They're like, all pissed at Adam.

660
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,300
Because I was hosting them.

661
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,300
Like, you know, you should just leave the feed empty blah blah blah.

662
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,300
And I was like, that's fucking great.

663
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,300
You know, podcasting is all about, like,

664
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,300
giving people choices, right?

665
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,300
And, and the freedom for people to do their shows the way they want.

666
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,300
Once again, it's a tolerance thing, right?

667
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,300
But, like, you know, but, but, you know,

668
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,300
I'm going to tell you how you should do your show.

669
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,300
Fuckin' that fucking douchebag.

670
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,300
I can't remember who it was.

671
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,300
It left that.

672
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,300
So, it's like, dude, if you don't like it,

673
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,300
don't fucking listen.

674
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,300
Exactly.

675
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,300
Skip ahead.

676
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,300
Yeah.

677
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,300
Adam will be back next week.

678
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,300
At least, you know, if he,

679
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,300
Maybe.

680
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,300
Maybe.

681
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,300
Yeah.

682
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,300
If he can unzip the eye holes in the gimp suit,

683
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,300
and doesn't run into the tams or something like that.

684
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,300
I wonder if he'd float.

685
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,300
I don't know that.

686
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,300
That's in the suit, I mean.

687
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,300
Yeah, it's kind of, the, the, the chains on it.

688
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,300
They're kind of heavy.

689
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,300
That's true.

690
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,300
Yeah, especially the, the ones that go from nipple to nipple.

691
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,300
That's a heavy chain.

692
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,300
So that is.

693
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,300
Yeah.

694
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,300
But he insisted.

695
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,300
So.

696
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,300
And I got this one from Paul Shepherd.

697
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,300
Paul writes in says,

698
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,300
Today is International Disadvantaged People's Day.

699
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,300
Please send an encouraging message to a retarded friend.

700
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,300
Just as I've done.

701
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,300
Meaning to me.

702
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,300
I don't care if you lick windows through farm animals.

703
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,300
Take the short bus or occasionally shit yourself.

704
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,300
You hang in there sunshine.

705
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,300
You're fucking special.

706
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,300
From Paul Shepherd.

707
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,300
Who, who calls himself a Guatemala file.

708
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,300
So dirty filthy Guatemala file.

709
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,300
With this, you know, little pictures of Guatemala.

710
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,300
So they're beating off to Guatemala.

711
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,300
Pictures trained it with other Guatemala files.

712
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,300
You know, based on.

713
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,300
You got to frame that.

714
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,300
I love that.

715
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,300
So.

716
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,300
So.

717
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,300
Thank you, Paul.

718
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,300
Beautiful.

719
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,300
That may be the best email I've ever heard.

720
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,300
I love that.

721
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,300
Thank you, Paul.

722
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,300
Thank you.

723
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,300
I am special now.

724
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,300
Have you ever seen Doofy?

725
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,300
Oh, I'll tell you.

726
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,300
It's time for Doofy to make a return engagement.

727
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,300
Yeah, it is.

728
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,300
Time to revive Doofy.

729
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,300
Yeah, exactly.

730
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,300
But you know, you know what?

731
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,300
I loved.

732
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,300
Oh, my God.

733
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,300
So on on.

734
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,300
Hold on.

735
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,300
On UC radio pod show.

736
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,300
I said it.

737
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,300
I said it.

738
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,300
It worked.

739
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,300
So on UC radio pod show.

740
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:33,300
You told that story about how there was a girl who works at your bank.

741
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,300
Pretty nice.

742
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,300
Pretty girl.

743
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,300
You said you wanted to like jack off on her face.

744
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,300
What was that?

745
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,300
No, maybe maybe that's I'm just adding that.

746
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,300
So no, so they would.

747
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,300
So you used to go into the bank and she'd be there.

748
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,300
And you know, and then you went in there one time.

749
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,300
And she had.

750
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,300
Veneers.

751
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,300
Not Veneers.

752
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,300
Veneers.

753
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,300
Veneers.

754
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,300
Veneers.

755
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,300
Veneers.

756
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,300
Veneers.

757
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,300
Veneers.

758
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,300
Veneers.

759
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,300
Veneers.

760
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,300
Veneers.

761
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,300
Veneers.

762
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,300
Veneers.

763
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,300
She had to wear a neck brace to keep her head up.

764
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,300
Exactly.

765
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:13,300
And so she said to you, she said to you, I can't even do it.

766
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,300
Emma Emma.

767
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,300
And you're your son Nick, your five-year-old son Nick.

768
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,300
Said.

769
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,300
He actually said that sounds like doofy.

770
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,300
Right.

771
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:29,300
Which would shock me because my first house where the fuck did he hear doofy.

772
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,300
They're like, oh shit.

773
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,300
I really am playing it too loud.

774
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,300
Yeah.

775
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,300
Apparently.

776
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,300
I love that.

777
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,300
Yeah.

778
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,300
It's less dangerous.

779
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,300
Yeah.

780
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,300
Well, what can you do?

781
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,300
What you're going to do, please.

782
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,300
All right.

783
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,300
So I'm, I'm thinking we better go chase Adam down before.

784
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,300
Yeah.

785
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,300
He's been out long enough.

786
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,300
Yeah.

787
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,300
So in the English sunshine.

788
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,300
No.

789
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,300
In this gimp suit.

790
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,300
In his gimp suit.

791
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,300
Yeah.

792
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,300
Did you have the ball in his mouth?

793
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,300
Like gag ball.

794
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,300
Oh, the aiming the rubber ball, not the.

795
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,300
Yeah.

796
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,300
Oh, I thought you meant your ball.

797
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,300
But anyway.

798
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:00,800
No.

799
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,800
So, all right.

800
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,800
Well, we better, yeah.

801
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
So we're going to go, we're going to go find Adam.

802
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,800
And, you know, hopefully nothing, nothing bad has happened to him or nothing worse has happened to him.

803
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,800
It's worse.

804
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,800
All right.

805
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,800
Everybody.

806
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,800
I think we're out of here.

807
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,800
So, uh, once again, send me an email.

808
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
Where is Adam Curry at gmail.com?

809
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,800
Or Adam Curry's gay at gmail.com?

810
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,800
Or call the comment line 1-800-875-0995.

811
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,800
Yeah.

812
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,800
So, uh, Mike, uh, great to have you.

813
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,800
