1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I present Padshal's poet laureate Melvin P. LeBeth.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Roses are ready. My sweater is beige. For your domain name needs, you should go to this page. GoDaddy.com.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hey everybody, how you doing? It's episode 524 of the Daily Source Code. From almost empty, you can hear it.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Can you just hear the echo? Oh wait a minute, that's my mixer board. Yeah, all that's left. Actually, the Shandeliers are even gone at this point.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
All the boxes are gone. It is the big move of 2007, we're moving from Cottage A to Cottage B on the other side of town, the other side of the tracks.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's been nice, I've been going through all, it's so hard doing this. You find stuff and it takes you on an instantaneous trip down memory lane, pictures, recordings, of course.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You know, I packed away my archive of audio and video stuff. I actually have seven boxes of mini DV tapes, all 60 minutes in length. So, there's probably several hundred.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Probably like 200 hours of video from our reality show, Adam's family. I uncovered those, man. That's gonna be great to look at one day.

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And tomorrow, the podcast console actually will be dismantled. There's good news because it appears that the big green thing, the ugly green chair that we can actually dismantle that and we'll be able to get it up into the third floor.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My domain in the new Cottage shows a lot going on here. Of course, there's a lot going on around the world and Cali Lewis is pretty busy yourself.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Adam, it's Cali from Geek Brief TV. As you know, this week is C. Yes, the biggest consumer electronics show. So, if anyone's interested in gadgets, I just wanted to let everybody know we're putting out two to three shows a day.

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's gonna be fun.

13
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is she not Cali, are you not doing anything at Mac world? That's what a difficult choice that must have been for her, man.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I know she's such a major Mac head to not to not go to Mac Mac and must have been very, very hard. Maybe she will be doing some stuff there.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll look forward to updates from CES at GeekBreef.tv or GeekBreef.GeekBreefTV.podshow.com.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This morning, the BBC aired my interview about what they call user-generated content in regards to news reporting and the Saddam Hussein video, which I posted about before the new year.

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And it was, and that's kind of cool. You know, I'd promise myself that I was going to be posting more of my weblog and immediately I strike. I get a hit.

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And I was able to explain that in a little bit more detail in the interview. I put a link to the interview on Curry.com.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And of course, I'll put a link to that interview in today's show notes as well.

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A reminder that the Marie Claire show, the mast head, has launched.

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's very much the Delaware's product. Only it's, well, it's real. And it's about a real magazine. It's about real fashion. It's a part of our forthcoming fashion channel, which will be launching very soon.

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You can find it Marie Claire.podshow.com. I think it's also the masthead.podshow.com is where the actual show lives.

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So that's kind of just a quick update for me for today.

24
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll be able to do a show, or at least the best of Charlie every single day, because it's funny how after you do a week or the best of Charlie's and after several weeks of asking for them. Now all of a sudden, all these people are saying, hey, can I still fit one in?

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So we might even have to run through the weekend to fit them all in, but Julian Smith and over your head will do one.

26
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There's only a couple more to go for this week. And then, of course, next week will be a little bit sporadic because I have to travel a San Francisco.

27
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I will have the the broadband dog dongle adapter from from vote of phone, although it's been sitting at the post office for two days. I keep calling for redelivery. I get an answering machine.

28
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And you're supposed to give your your name, your address and your item number and they just haven't redeliberted it yet. So I haven't been able to test it.

29
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And otherwise, everything else is fine. So I want to thank you all so much for attending the notes of encouragement. Those of you who know what a big move is like. It is the big move of 2007 rolling up best of Charlie's.

30
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000

And my love my true cyber love. Angie B delivered a best of Charlie for me to play for you today. I'm so happy. It has a subtitle. Adam loves the ladies. Oh, yes, I do baby.

34
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Get ready for another best of Charlie edition of the daily source code with your guest hostess Angie B.

35
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now we all know that Adam loves ladies and ladies of Adam. So for his listening pleasure, I thought it compiles some of my favorite female front and songs that he's played on the DSC of the past four or five months.

36
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Moving could be so stressful. I'm sure he's ready for a little downtime right about now. Let's hope this does the trick.

37
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And welcome watch me shine. Stand back and watch me shine. Stand back and watch me shine.

38
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, don't worry. I've made a way and got my life inside, waiting for the moment when it will look longer high.

39
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This deep inside me is a spark and when I feel this time, I will release it from the heart. Stand back and watch me shine. Stand back and watch me shine.

40
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Stand back and watch me shine. Stand back and watch me shine. I am everything and I am nothing. I am yours and you are mine.

41
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I am everything and I am everything and I am everything and I am everything and I am everything and I am everything and I am everything and I am everything and I am everything.

42
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Stand back and watch me shine. Stand back and watch me shine.

43
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This deep inside me is a spark and when I feel this time, I will release it from the heart.

44
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Just stand back and watch me shine. Stand back and watch me shine. Stand back and watch me shine. Stand back and watch me shine.

45
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Stand back and watch me shine. Stand back and watch me shine. Stand back and watch me shine.

46
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Stand back and watch me shine. Stand back and watch me shine.

47
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,280
I'm so wish I could say it was pot safe, but we're not quite there yet.

48
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,200
This is a song that's been stuck in my head for the past couple of weeks, because it's

49
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,440
the theme tune to In the Attic, that's the show we have going on now with the P-Tounsend

50
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,500
is a better half, Rachel Fuller, Pete's brother, Simon Townsend, if you find it in the

51
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Attic.com.

52
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,980
Of course, Pete and Rachel and Simon also have profiles on Potcha Plus, BT Potcha.com to be

53
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
exact.

54
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:41,460
You can get to it from Potcha.com or from BT Potcha, Rachel Fuller. Potcha.com, Pete Townsend.potcha.com.

55
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,980
That song has just been haunting me, and I sent an email to Rachel and I said, I really

56
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,300
want to play that on my show, knowing, by the way, that Michael Butler is hot on her

57
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,340
trail to get some of her stuff up on the P-M-N, as well as of course he's going to go

58
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,340
after some of the new stuff.

59
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,820
And it was a really catchy track out of good choice.

60
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,140
Two band Rachel hasn't put that on the Potcha music network yet, I don't get back to her

61
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,140
on that one.

62
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:13,900
So let's see that hailed from DSC 502, from November 22nd 2006.

63
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:22,840
This next track that I selected came from DSC 405, from October 25th 2006, excellent choice

64
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
at him.

65
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,220
It's guaranteed that we'll all have us in the mood, and you know what, he turned me

66
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:45,820
on too, baby.

67
00:10:45,820 --> 00:11:03,700
Like a flower waiting to bloom, like a light bulb in a dark room, I'm here waiting

68
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:27,140
for you to come home and turn me on, like a desert waiting for rain, like a school

69
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:48,940
here waiting for spring, I'm sitting here waiting for you to come home and turn me on

70
00:11:48,940 --> 00:12:05,060
like a flower waiting to bloom, like a light bulb in a dark room, I'm here waiting

71
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:21,060
for you to come home and turn me on, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in

72
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:30,060
a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in

73
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:46,060
a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in

74
00:12:46,060 --> 00:13:16,060
a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like a light bulb in a dark room, like

75
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:22,840
gimme some m Meghan, mais, mais, mais.

76
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:36,280
And I have eyes waiting for a new tune, and my glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes.

77
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

78
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
And tell me

79
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

80
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,280
And tell me

81
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

82
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
And tell me

83
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

84
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

85
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

86
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

87
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

88
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

89
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

90
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

91
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

92
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

93
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,280
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home

94
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,480
Perfect

95
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Very lazy Wednesday

96
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,280
Grace-guys outside, key-drawn inside

97
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,800
feeling like crap, my friends, I think the flu is still with me. I've carried it back.

98
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,400
Maybe it's the second day of jet lag, but I just woke up, I just feel, you know what I mean?

99
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,960
It could care as hell, I feel. You've got your own problems, right? This is from the pod

100
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:18,440
safe music network and Jersey Todd, I learned me to the fact that it was, of course,

101
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,160
nothing special there. This is job as the official music college at the Charlie. Nina Simone

102
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,200
turned me on to Tony Humphrey's vocal mix Nina Simone, of course, a superstar in her own right.

103
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,520
The helm straight on him. You might want to check out her Wikipedia entry for a little bit more

104
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:40,600
enlightenment on that subject. If you dare. So you know Adam, you could feel free to cry,

105
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,280
my shoulder anytime you like, I'm always there for your baby. So let's get back into some more music.

106
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:52,440
I love the ladies. That's right, and my name is Leroy. I guess I'm not in on that

107
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:03,560
This is Rebecca Havelin, also from New York. You'll love her voice man. She plays, she writes, she sings,

108
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,520
and she's pod safe. I found you.

109
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:39,080
But when you found me that night and you held me tight, I knew I'd never run from love again.

110
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:57,320
I've been down this road, one, two, many times, I teach, day it just feels like a blind in the blind.

111
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:13,240
But you had the same. I've been searching for all my life, and I'll never stumble again.

112
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:29,800
Girls, when I didn't think that I would ever find love again, I felt you, oh yes, I did.

113
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:46,920
And when I didn't think that I would ever find love again, oh I felt you, oh yes, I did.

114
00:18:46,920 --> 00:19:08,360
I found you. You held me here when I was weary, and you held me down when I was afraid to jump.

115
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:23,160
Did I still push you away? Only because I was afraid, who's in the game once again?

116
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:45,560
Oh, I didn't realize all the COVID-19. Until I didn't have it, I don't know. So, won't you accept my plea?

117
00:19:45,560 --> 00:20:12,280
And come back to me, and I'll stay right here to me, because when I didn't think that I would ever find love again, I felt you, oh yes, I did.

118
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:35,640
And I didn't think that I would ever find love again, oh I felt you, oh yes, I did. I found you.

119
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,280
Rebecca Havilland, I found you on the plot-safe music network, that's exactly where I found you.

120
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:49,880
I love Rebecca Havilland's voice, so great. And by the way, the New York comment did not pertain to Nina Simone.

121
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:59,480
So this next band, it was tough to choose which track to play, but the clip I selected has such a great story that it was just a no-brainer.

122
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:08,600
So here we go. And I want to wind up today's celebratory episode with song from, actually it is the song I have to say,

123
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,520
that really got my juices flowing two years ago, over two years ago,

124
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:21,400
when we, well, I guess when we started numbering the shows, it was all talk back in the time.

125
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,440
I think that we smartly had all kind of figured out, hey, wait a minute, maybe we should not be playing any

126
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,080
music, because this music licensing thing is very complicated. This is before the podcast,

127
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,840
music network as well. The music licensing is complicated, and we got something really interesting going here.

128
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,800
Why don't we just stay away from playing music all together? Because the last thing we needed,

129
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:53,240
over two and a half years ago, is to have the RIA brand podcasting as some type of illicit pirate activity.

130
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,960
And so that's literally what it was. They were very, they were celiloquies.

131
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,600
Remember that? We used to talk about, who was it? Who said that, celiloquy?

132
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,400
Podcasting is nothing more than celiloquy. So which, of course, is partially true, but it's

133
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:15,080
become so much more. But I do recall, bumping into a band, online, who had their, their songs online,

134
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,520
available for, I think was a preview, listen, or whatever. I had one song, you could actually download,

135
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,080
and they were selling their CDs on CD-Babe, completely independent, four girls from New York,

136
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,080
and I really, really thought the song that I had found, which is for off of their CD, was so appropriate.

137
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,000
In so many twisted ways, is to what was happening with, with this thing that, at the time,

138
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,120
wasn't even called podcasting. We didn't really have a name for it.

139
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,280
That I, you know, I sent the singer of the band, the new mail and said, hey, would you mind if I,

140
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,240
if I played this song on my, on my show over here, and I sent you a given example, she said,

141
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,120
yeah, absolutely knock yourself out. And so I put a link back to their site, and where they sell their CD,

142
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,680
and as I said, you know, iTunes, even, and no, I'm sorry, not iTunes. What they selling it on iTunes?

143
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:07,480
I think they might have had it on iTunes at that point, but definitely CD-Babe. And I played it,

144
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,920
and then a couple of the people who were experimenting along with this in those early days,

145
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,480
played it, and then a few weeks later, I got to an email back that said, hey, you know, we're actually

146
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,520
selling CDs because of this. And that's when I got, that's really when Ron and I started to work on

147
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,200
the podcast and music network. You know, how can we make that? Obviously, it's working.

148
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,520
There's, I can now legally use content to fill up my show, which I love doing. It's,

149
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,520
it's, you know, to me, it's the same as someone sending an audio comment. It's, you know,

150
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:43,160
it's someone's passion. There are their their soul. And, you know, they want to get credited for it,

151
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,800
and, and if possible, they, you know, they have a business model. They want to make some money. So,

152
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,320
we came up with the idea for the podcast, music license. And so, really was, in those early days,

153
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,800
this song, that band that got my juices flowing, and they have not stopped. In fact, they're

154
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,920
