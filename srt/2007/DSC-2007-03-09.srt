1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Planting a Jamaican getaway?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Flystone, our stone detendence will see that you arrive with a load.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
John wants you to fly.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In a world where TV networks, movie studios and record labels still think they can govern what you see in here.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
One man has the power to return control of entertainment to the masses and make big media corporations wet their tiny little pants.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
From Pod Show, comb of the world's most dangerous new content comes the Daily Source Code with Adam Curry.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 560.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'd like to think I'm flying you to the future.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's official it's free bar Friday we are fucked up beyond all repair.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This time it's for real my friend stay tuned to your Charlie.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
My full bar star.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Is there some way to make this clear?

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Because of you I can't sleep anymore since you walked out the door and you left me.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
All I do is stare at the wall thinking no thoughts at all.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Simply remember why do you want to drive me insane?

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why do you want to cause me so much pain?

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Growing a fire.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't think I can make it on my own.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Growing a fire.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm afraid that I might die even on the long way.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So be excited.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Tell me that you're still in love with me.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What you're from in my eye.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can't feel.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So no darkness from light.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't know daytime from night on his face and he isn't real.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh well I wake up from this and the midst of your tears and embrace it.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What they tell them I'm supposed to.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't think I can make it without you but for me.

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't think I can make it on my own.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Growing a fire.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm afraid that I might die even on the long way.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So be excited.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Tell me that you're still in love with me.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What you're from in my eye.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't think I can make it on my own.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Growing a fire.

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't think I can make it on my own.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Growing a fire.

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm afraid that I might die even on the long way.

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So be excited.

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Tell me that you're still in love with me.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What you're from in my eye.

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't think I can make it on my own.

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Definitely a footballer favorite Kevin Reeves throw me a line.

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's exactly what I need today.

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know how your fright is going but mine is fucked up beyond all repair.

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's so bad.

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Things start off so bad today.

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't want to harsh your mellow or anything but I almost didn't do a show.

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I was like, oh man, I'm not going to have any time now.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Everything's gone exactly wrong.

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's all wrong.

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I had it also planned out.

59
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It started last night.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Lady Patricia not feeling well.

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Of course you had all the news bleed crap yesterday.

62
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And I was at the day before.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't even remember.

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So she went to bed early and she has a maybe a little bit of the flu.

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's not like it isn't going around.

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And this morning she had an appointment at 10 30 or something or 10 40.

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
To go back to the doctor so that now that a lot of the nose bleeding had stopped or had subsided

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
since that huge episode.

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Then the doctor could look and see what's going on.

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And her nose started bleeding again before she had to go to the appointment.

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So of course I'm going to drive her there.

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
In case we can go to the hospital and get this thing closed up.

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's not a very tough procedure.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well it turns out that there's not really just one vein on the inside of her nose.

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This is such a horrible discussion.

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Anyway, they can't do anything about it.

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But there may be some infection that is leading her, you know, making her nose be a little bit

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
susceptible to rawness.

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's crap, right?

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So that's crap by itself because I got, I'm on a tight schedule today.

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yesterday I went out and I got myself the new mobile set up.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I promised myself because you know, I've got I've got to set up at the condo.

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The bakers rack and San Francisco.

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I've got everything set up here in the attic at the curry manner.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And I needed something to take with me to New York because I'm going to be there for a week.

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And, you know, I want to have good sound.

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sick and tired of, you know, half-assed stuff.

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But I wanted something small.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So, man, it's hard to find what we really need as podcasters.

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It really is.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I mean, I use cast blaster, which is perfect.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But then I want some processing.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I want signal processing.

94
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So I can, you know, send the whole signal mic and music, etc.

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Through one compressor limiter.

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And I also need to be able to hear what it sounds like on the other end of the compressor limiter.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So, you know, that's a tall order.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Some beautiful barangir mixers really, really cute.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And I could take two of these barangir mixers.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I use one of the inputs, which would send through to a device, which I'll tell you about in a second.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And then into the second barangir mixer, which would basically just act as a headphone mixer.

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Perfect, right?

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Get wrong.

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Because these portable mixers come with power supplies that will only do 240 volts.

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They won't do 110 volts.

106
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And, of course, it's not a big deal because you can get a new power adapter.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah.

108
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But not when you have to have like the funky wacky five-pin barangir power supply plug.

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So, that's like a non-starter.

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So, I went back to, I went to Anderton.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You know, the place where Roger did is a splash in dash.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And I picked up another one of those compact four.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let me see.

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Hold on a second.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Sorry about that.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I just had to pick it up off of the floor.

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The sound craft, four channel, because I know how this one works.

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And it's bigger than I wanted.

120
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But probably if you took the two small barangir side by side,

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
it's probably about the same weight and same size.

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And, of course, now I only need one power supply.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And I will have to get a different one, but this has a standard jack.

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And I got this, something that was really popular apparently about a year or two ago.

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's a half rack module, which means it's not a huge like 19 inch rack mounted thing that you want to stick in your luggage.

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's a blue max smart compressor, really sweet stereo, half rack size works on 220 or 120 second.

127
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh, please.

128
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah.

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
12240 volt AC.

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's interesting.

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It says on the bottom, though, factory configured for 220 volts AC.

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Does that mean that I have to change something on the inside somehow?

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, please don't tell me that's true.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What a pain in the ass, that'll be.

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, if it says 12240.

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, crap.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Anyway, so pick those two items up on up.

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And test it out and so everything's working.

139
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I've got all the, you know, bought new cables, especially.

140
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So anyway, that was to make up time for today because I want to do a proper food bar Friday.

141
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I also wanted to pay a couple bills before I left, you know, like the car company and stuff like that.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's the only real bills that are, everything else is automatic, I guess.

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But for some reason, I can't transfer money electronically to the car company.

144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And so I'm, so after I get back with Patricia Martin hour behind, I get picked up at 245 today.

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It is now one o'clock.

146
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And you know, stuff to pack my suitcase and do all kinds of crap.

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And so I, I'm, I'm a Gmail, do my show prep is usual.

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You know, downloading stuff and also looking at some other email.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And I go to reply to someone.

150
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And I get the, unfortunately, rather familiar message, you know, unable to send mail.

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is in Gmail, unable to send mail because you've exceeded your quota.

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
By the way, I should say that Patricia's going to be okay.

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's just kind of tinkering with, with medication.

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I should be all right.

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's not a life-threatening situation.

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So, you know, I go to save the message as a draft.

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Now, this is new because it wouldn't let me save it as a draft either because I'd exceeded my quota.

158
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And just before this happened, you know, Gmail, Farts and Burps once in a while and you get to like, oops, something happened.

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Error numbers.

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So, and so, please try again in a couple of minutes.

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So, that had happened just before this started to happen.

162
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So, I was already a little suspicious looking around.

163
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Really, interestingly, because obviously, my mail quota was exceeded.

164
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You know, I'm always skating around the 98 to 99% of my Gmail.

165
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was using a lot of my folders with Splendid.

166
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And now, I have that special four gig.

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
A lot meant that I got through one of our board members.

168
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It was also on the board of Google.

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I said, you know, two gigs just saying, actually, I need much more than four gigs.

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But two gigs definitely wasn't cutting it for me.

171
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So, I needed more.

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I got four gigs, which was cool.

173
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And it lasted certainly about six months, the additional two gigs.

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And ever since then, I've been skating along the 98-99% saturation of the account.

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And I noticed that indicator that's at the bottom of every Gmail page, it says, you know,

176
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
it's normally it's green if you're okay.

177
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And then it may go red if you get to 99% and then a certain point you're at 100%

178
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and then you have to actually go in and delete something and delete it forever from the trash.

179
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And it's gone.

180
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That indicator has gone.

181
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And I see, it's like they did a refresh.

182
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They, something was refreshed.

183
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The interface made some very, very subtle differences.

184
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Really more in where words and stuff were placed.

185
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But it didn't seem like a big deal, but, you know,

186
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
no matter what page I went to, I couldn't find my quota anywhere.

187
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So then, you know, then I went into the trash and lo and behold,

188
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
you're not going to believe what happened.

189
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
All of a sudden, I'm a 141% of my allotment.

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And it even says, oh, I copied this for you.

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
As I emptied out the trash, no conversations in the trash.

192
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Who needs to delete when you have over two gigs of storage, unlike two gigs?

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Wait a minute.

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And then I realized what's happened.

195
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
When they did some kind of refresh at Google for Gmail,

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
my account got rejiggered back to a norm.

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I mean, it's a regular free account, right?

198
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Only instead of two gigs I had four gigs.

199
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, that just went away.

200
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And now I have two gigs instead of four gigs.

201
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The good news is it's got all my mail there.

202
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So it hasn't deleted anything, but it, you know,

203
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:46,000
it says I have 3,999 megabytes, 141% of my two gigallotment.

204
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, no.

205
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And I've never had it, of course, I've been at a hundred percent,

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
made even a hundred, 102 percent,

207
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
but I've never been at a hundred and 41 percent.

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And to my knowledge, when your, when your Gmail box is that full,

209
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
email still comes in.

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Well, that doesn't happen when it's at a hundred and 41 percent.

211
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I tested from a Yahoo account I have,

212
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and it got returned as recipient has exceeded quota permanent failure.

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh, no.

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And this is bad, and because this Gmail account,

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
everything comes to the Gmail account.

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So immediately, I think, okay, what can I do?

217
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Because, you know, I've got no time.

218
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I've got, I've got to fix this problem.

219
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So, all right, so why don't I afford all incoming mail to my Yahoo mailbox,

220
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
which was empty because I had to reactivate that because I hadn't used it for so long.

221
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And, well, that doesn't work because it's just bouncing email messages back.

222
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So it's not forwarding anything.

223
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's how I came up.

224
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's how I figured out that with the 141% of your Gmail account,

225
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
you know, you're no longer allowed to receive anything.

226
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's not keeping it for your Google is turning it away at the door.

227
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So I'm like, I got to solve this.

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So I opened up another Gmail account.

229
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Thinking, well, what was I thinking?

230
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I was thinking like, well, I could probably pop it over.

231
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm like, no, wait a minute, I got the Google apps domain stuff.

232
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I just haven't gotten into it because I wanted to spend some time,

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
take my time.

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Because, you know, you're dealing with DNS stuff,

235
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and MX records, and all kinds of crap like this.

236
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And I'm just not prepared for it because, you know,

237
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I have family members and people who depend on email working,

238
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and I have to set it up just right and make sure that if they're using pop mail,

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
because I know a couple of the accounts are actually accessing

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
mail.curry.com or whatever it is.

241
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You know, to pop the mail out of an account there.

242
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Now, to add on top of that, I know this is really geeky,

243
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
but I know some of you do enjoy these trials and tribulations.

244
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
My email is being hosted by a company called Runbox.

245
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And I thought Runbox was going to be a really good idea.

246
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You know, relatively small company.

247
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Good, good personal customer service and support,

248
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
offering plenty of space to, you know,

249
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
to manage all email coming into like thecurry.com domain.

250
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Separate accounts, rules for, you know,

251
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
for stuff that goes to non-existent accounts.

252
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So it's a really nice setup, right?

253
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And anything that comes into, because I don't pop my mail from there.

254
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Anything that comes into Adam at curry.com is redirected,

255
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
redirected to my Gmail account.

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Or maybe even to podshow.com first.

257
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't know, maybe directly to my Gmail account.

258
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And they have a quota system too,

259
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
because you're allowed to receive as much email as you can through their system.

260
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But actually the sending of email,

261
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the reporting or the redirecting I'm doing,

262
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
because it does save a copy for a period of time in that runbox email system.

263
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That's limited to, I don't know, like 5,000 messages a day.

264
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So the spam that's not being filtered out by runbox,

265
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
which is significant, Gmail does a great job of filtering out all that crap.

266
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But of course, it has to be because, you know,

267
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
you got to be careful when you are the main,

268
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
you know, the mail master, if you will,

269
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
master of the mail, you got to be careful about just throwing shit out.

270
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And so a lot of, you know,

271
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
definitely more than 5,000 messages a day are forwarded to my Gmail account,

272
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and then they eventually wind up in the junk folder,

273
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and then spam folder.

274
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So yeah, that's where the curry.com problem comes from.

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Is this making any sense?

276
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So, you know, I know that I have to change my MX records,

277
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
which means all mail gets routed from the runbox over to my Google apps.

278
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
My premier edition domain stuff.

279
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And I just wanted to take some time to do it,

280
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
but now I have to go into acceleration mode.

281
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So I'm like, right, okay, on this premier edition,

282
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I've got 10 gigs of space per email account.

283
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So that's more than enough to take care of this problem.

284
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Of course, you have to verify that you are the true holder of the domain name

285
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
before you can actually use that 10 gig account.

286
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So, you know, you can either change your MX records,

287
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
which is exactly what I didn't want to do,

288
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
because I don't want to do that in a rush.

289
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Now, they have something else where you can verify by adding a C name.

290
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So I did that, of course, you know, network solution says,

291
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
oh, that's fine.

292
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That's the only domain I still have in network solutions.

293
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Everything else has been migrated over to GoDaddy.

294
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And boy, I'm really hurt and I wish I had this one over at GoDaddy,

295
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
but I was just so afraid of it fucking up during the transfer

296
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and network solution sucks so much ass with transfers

297
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
that I just want to leave it until, you know,

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
a day when I was going to figure all the shit out,

299
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
which is now, of course, coming upon me very quickly.

300
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Anyway, so I get the MX, the C name record added,

301
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm allowed to use the 10 gig email account.

302
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So I quickly, I set up pop.

303
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So now, as we speak,

304
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and it's a really slow process, as we speak,

305
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I don't know how many emails I have in my Gmail account,

306
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
but, you know, four gigs worth, no doubt about it.

307
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I had about 26, 27,000 marked as new,

308
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
or unread, which doesn't really mean it haven't,

309
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
not read them, but, you know, I probably read them

310
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and marked them as unread to come back to one day

311
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and then it scrolls off and you lose that email forever.

312
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So I'm now popping over four gigs worth of data.

313
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yippee-kai-yay.

314
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So don't send me email.

315
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's not going to go anywhere, it's not going to happen,

316
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
it's just not going to work.

317
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh, man.

318
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Ah, okay.

319
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So how's your fucking football going, eh?

320
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I want to say congratulations to the jersey tads,

321
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
the tads and jersey.

322
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yesterday, Robin Bella was born.

323
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I actually have an email here from Todd.

324
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Guys, I'm like on his blackberry sending me updates

325
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
from, it was a Robin Bella was being delivered

326
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
by C-section, so they knew exactly timing and everything.

327
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
8.1 pounds, 19.5 inches.

328
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Mom and baby are great, dad needs a nap.

329
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's what jersey Todd sent to me.

330
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You got dude.

331
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You need a nap.

332
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But your wife, man.

333
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
She got just cut open.

334
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I really want to hear if you saw it,

335
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
because I remember when Christina was born

336
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
through C-section as well as an awesome experience.

337
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But please, man.

338
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Don't pretend like, like, you know,

339
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
it was a lot of work for you.

340
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
30 seconds tops.

341
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Comic strip.

342
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Comic strip.

343
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Comic strip.

344
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Comic strip.

345
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Comic strip.

346
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Comic strip.

347
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Comic strip.

348
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Comic strip.

349
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Knock, knock.

350
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Adam, carry.

351
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Are you there?

352
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm here.

353
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Stop fiddling with this fucking knock.

354
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You're tablet for a fact's sake.

355
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Here is your European Union correspondent.

356
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I just wanted to say that there is only two things

357
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I hate in this world.

358
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
People who are intolerant of other people's cultures.

359
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And the Dutch.

360
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Adam.

361
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Can you imagine that while majority of European Union has already opened

362
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
their labor markets, the fucking Dutch despite promises,

363
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
have not opened theirs on January the 1st, 2007,

364
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
so it will not happen on March the 1st, 2007,

365
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
as the latest promise was saying.

366
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So let me tell it again.

367
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Fuck you, Netherlands.

368
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I, and 80 million European citizens who are affected

369
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
will remember this Dutch disgrace, Dutch disgrace,

370
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
for fucking ever.

371
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, those Dutch bastards.

372
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
They killed Kenny.

373
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
They killed who?

374
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I was like, did he say they killed Kennedy?

375
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I didn't hear that.

376
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
For fucking ever.

377
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Those Dutch bastards.

378
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
They killed Kenny.

379
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yo.

380
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I have no idea who they killed.

381
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
There is some weird shit going on in Holland.

382
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I have to say they, they finally now have a cabinet.

383
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
There were some problems putting a coalition together after the most recent elections.

384
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And what's interesting is that two cabinet members have dual citizenship.

385
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And the opposing party parties, I should say,

386
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
are saying, hey, you know, there's a real issue here because who's loyalty

387
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
to who are these two cabinet members who have dual citizenship?

388
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I think one is from Turkey, one is from Morocco.

389
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So they have Dutch passports and one is a Turkish,

390
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
one is a Moroccan passport.

391
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
By the way, Islamic countries, it to some degree.

392
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So their loyalty was being questioned.

393
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And it's interesting because this really did spark off a lot of media attention

394
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
about this particular question of loyalty based upon your dual citizenship.

395
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And I got asked by a pretty serious publication.

396
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
How do you feel about this?

397
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And I said, well, look, everyone thinks I'm Dutch,

398
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
but I was born American.

399
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I've always had an American passport.

400
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I have never requested the Dutch nationality.

401
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Nor do I desire to give up my U.S. nationality for any reason whatsoever.

402
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And, you know, and I said, but, you know, when I was there,

403
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I was loyal to the country, when I was there.

404
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So yeah, there's a lot of weird shit going on with them.

405
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's for sure.

406
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And you know something's really interesting with podcasting

407
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
when the people who call in are engineers and they all have their own jingles.

408
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So I think program at your command is the prolific program program.

409
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I had them prove that program is here.

410
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I just landed in, you know, and therefore I won't be back in San Francisco tonight.

411
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm Friday.

412
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I was just about to ask you at that point over the weekend.

413
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And probably just call you in the comments and say,

414
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
hey, good job prolific programmer.

415
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I could actually understand you.

416
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And you didn't stutter and stammer.

417
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That was great.

418
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Too bad you're leaving New York because I'm about to go to New York.

419
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Where I will visit the serious satellite studios in New York.

420
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That's what you're listening to if you're on the satellite right now.

421
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Okay.

422
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So that I have no no time to get into all the stuff I'd planned today.

423
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
There was one thing.

424
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I want to set it up because I want to get back to this on Monday.

425
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's not often that I know that I'm going to talk about this on a different day.

426
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Last night on Channel 4, which had been advertised.

427
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'd seen it the promo is on TV for at least a week.

428
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
There was an awesome, awesome documentary called The Great Global Warming Swindle.

429
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Of course, you know, that really caught my eye.

430
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Being a child of the 70s, the great rock and roll swindle from the sex pistols, of course, fabulous.

431
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So the great global warming swindle.

432
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It's rather long, but it's really important that you try and see this if you can.

433
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I have no idea if it's going to be aired in the United States or any other countries.

434
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
If I had the time, I'm telling you, I would get a copy and put this up on YouTube.

435
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I think it's that important, not necessarily because I'm saying that it's right,

436
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
but because I had never heard the supposing view of global warming.

437
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And so they do have a website, which I will put in the show notes.

438
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And actually, there's a, here, let's do this.

439
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Before I read pieces of the website, they have a trailer.

440
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So let me see if I can do this and be fire this up.

441
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Of course, this will take a few seconds because their trailer is an embedded windows media file.

442
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And I don't know about you, but in Firefox, at least.

443
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Whenever I use a windows media player embedded video, it kind of like freezes everything up.

444
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I told you yesterday that I don't like what windows media player does.

445
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
When it has to think about something, particular talking to the network, it gets all funky.

446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Okay, we're probably going to hear an ad first.

447
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Let me see. This is from Channel4.com.

448
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Some say that the time for debate is over, that mankind must face up to its responsibility for climate change.

449
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Now meet the experts who believe science tells a very different story.

450
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And people say we don't believe in global warming. I say, no, I don't believe in global warming.

451
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I don't believe that humans, you know, who is pausing that warming.

452
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You can't say that CO2 will drive climate. It's certainly never did in the past.

453
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
If you are skeptical about the litany around climate change, you're suddenly like you're a Holocaust denier.

454
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The global warming is dressed up as science, but it's not science.

455
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The most controversial and thought-provoking science film you'll see this year,

456
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
examines the role nature is playing in global warming.

457
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
They're just being told lies.

458
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
The Great Global Warming Swindle, Thursday 9 on 4.

459
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Now if you saw, by the way, we didn't get the ad. That was kind of cool.

460
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Because when I watched it, when I previewed it before the show, I did get the ad.

461
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So, that was smart. Thanks, guys.

462
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
If you have seen El Gore's movie, an inconvenient truth, then you have to see this movie to balance out your opinion.

463
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Let me just read from the site, and then I'll try and editorialize to make it a little more clear.

464
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
The Great Global Warming Swindle, the film brings together the arguments of leading scientists

465
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
who disagree with the prevailing consensus that carbon dioxide released by human industrial activity

466
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
is the cause of rising global temperatures today.

467
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
That's a catchy one, isn't it?

468
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That Earth's climate is changing and always has is not disputed by anyone.

469
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That is, that it is warming now is also not disputed by anyone.

470
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But some people think that the warming is our fault whilst others believe we have nothing to do with it.

471
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That really is true. This is what this film is about.

472
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's the difference, and there's some very, very compelling evidence that does not say or that refutes the claim

473
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,000
that CO2 emissions created by man are creating global warming.

474
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,000
In fact, quite the opposite according to the proof is that global warming, although it does take place over thousands of years

475
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and they have some interesting graphs to look at.

476
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It has been much, much colder and much, much warmer in the past 10,000 years than now.

477
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So when the Earth warms up CO2 actually follows and they have some theories about that,

478
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
or not just theories, but I guess all sciences in a way theory.

479
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Look, I'm not a scientist, but I was compelled by this movie.

480
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The film argues that rises in atmospheric carbon dioxide have nothing to do with climate change.

481
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Further, the present single-minded focus on reducing carbon emissions may have the unintended consequence of

482
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
stifling development in the third world, prolonging endemic poverty and disease.

483
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Recent research presented in this film apparently shows that the effect of cosmic radiation

484
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
and solar activity may explain fluctuations in global temperatures more precisely than the carbon dioxide theory.

485
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And when you see this, and you will be blown away, not just by the evidence presented,

486
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and of course, it's all in interpretation of numbers and data, but it's fascinating.

487
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So again, literally, the core difference here is that in this film, the theory is explained.

488
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And it's shown in data that carbon dioxide levels increase following the warming of the Earth.

489
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's not that carbon dioxide increases and then the Earth starts to warm up.

490
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And they have historical data going back quite a long time, almost as far back as I am old.

491
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And what's interesting about it is they go into the political aspects of it.

492
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm already really talking about this, but it's really on my mind.

493
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
This is what the shit I wanted to talk about today.

494
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
In the 70s, and they're blaming it on Margaret Thatcher, which is a fun thing to do.

495
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You can always blame everything on Margaret Thatcher.

496
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Of course, we had an energy crisis with the OPEC countries in the 70s.

497
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So Margaret Thatcher, of course, hated foreign oil.

498
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
She hated the coal miners because they were a big pain in her ass, at least, at the time.

499
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So she didn't want carbon emission based fuel, whatever.

500
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And she was a big proponent of nuclear.

501
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And through the campaigning that Margaret Thatcher did, more or less a meme was built that carbon dioxide is bad.

502
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And by the way, we're all made of carbon dioxide.

503
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm like 98% carbon dioxide, which includes water.

504
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's not like a bad thing.

505
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's not like a poison.

506
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Carbon dioxide is what makes things grow.

507
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But that kind of got turned around and twisted into this idea that carbon dioxide is essentially causing global warming.

508
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And they take it once a further.

509
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
The founder of Greenpeace, who was left Greenpeace since, he had a lot of interesting things to say.

510
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
He said, look, it's not even about the global climate anymore.

511
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It's being used as an excuse for anti-globalization and anti-capitalism, in fact.

512
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And that no politician today could have any type of platform without including greenness.

513
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And when you look at the data that's presented in this film, particularly that of all carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the troposphere,

514
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
the whole carbon dioxide, only about 1% is man-made.

515
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
1%.

516
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So, you know, there's so much new data in here that my head is just spinning.

517
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So I'll put the link in the show notes prominently so you can find it because there's a lot of information on the site.

518
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I don't think, I mean, are they going to, let's see if they're going to replay it now.

519
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh, that's too bad. Oh, what's this? Play, what is this?

520
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Oh, that's play fantasy football. Why don't they just, this is a great, they should put this on YouTube.

521
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's so, it's so good to see this.

522
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So, of course, you know, you take that a little bit further and then, you know, it's very unpopular.

523
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You know, you can't just stand up. It's like when I say, hey, hold on a second with your net neutrality.

524
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You know, there's a lot going on in networks. It's kind of the same thing.

525
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You know, people stand up and say, well, you know, this global warming thing is full of shit.

526
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And the zeitgeist is already so embedded in our minds that we're, you know, we immediately assume that someone who stands up and says that is a part of, you know, big oil or, I'm sorry.

527
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah, big oil or or different industries or the man or whatever.

528
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And really, there's enough evidence that, you know, you just might want to reconsider your opinion. It's really, really, really fascinating.

529
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And I'm going to study as much as I can about this about this theory and I'm really happy the channel for air that it just blew me away.

530
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It's too bad Patricia couldn't see because she was already in bed.

531
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Okay, and so then at the end of the day, what the documentary, it's a film, but I think it was more documentary.

532
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:59,000
What it, you know, what they hypothesize or what they go against that out to prove is that because there are such a movement that Africa is now being told, hey, you shouldn't be using your oil or your coal or other resources.

533
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You should be looking at, you know, if you want to develop, you should be looking at solar and wind energy and add like the African guys are like the fucking I'm going to do with the solar panel.

534
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
He'd up a transistor radio. I need to, you know, I need to be bacon steel here. We're not going to do that with solar panels.

535
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And look, please, if it's, if you can find this anywhere or if anyone knows where there's a copy available uploaded to Podshow, go ahead, put it, you can do it as an embeddable.

536
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
If we get to take down notice, we'll, we'll take it down, but you really have to see that it's that important. It really, really is.

537
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Whew, okay. So flying to New York today, but of course, we can't really have a complete full foobar without at least some word from the garden state, from the Jersey.

538
00:34:47,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Hey, how are you doing? Okay, I guess you have to be from Jersey to sound right saying that, right?

539
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm Brian from audio attitude, not in Jersey, but in Michigan's UP, as it happened just a few miles from Jeremy Roe.

540
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:29,000
When you hear Jeremy Roe play that, Fubar, Friday, Jersey Todd theme, Jersey Todd, the official musicologist of the Charlie plays a song from a great pod save artist.

541
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But not today, Adam, as you know, Jersey Todd is a bit too fubard to join us today, but he did send a quick update.

542
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Hey, it's time we're welcoming into the world, Robin, and Bella. He pounds one ounce, nineteen and a half inches, she's very pink and very mellow and very calm.

543
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I'll talk to you later. Bye bye.

544
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So I've been on some kind of a pod sabbatical thing, and Todd, the other day told me to get busy and do something useful.

545
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I said, why not fill in for Fubar Friday? Make sure you play something, Adam's going to like.

546
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Okay. Well, you got it, JT. Adam, today we're going to welcome a brand new very special talent to the PMM.

547
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:17,000
There's a good chance that everybody listening has heard his work. He's a music producer, songwriter composer, recording engineer, music performer, and even a Grammy nominee.

548
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:35,000
He's also from Jersey, and back in the Jersey days, he's now in Vegas. He had a studio in Mercerville, the cater declines like Bruce Foster, Skip Scarborough, instant funk, springsteens band, the smithereens, Bon Jovi Gettars, Richie Simbora and Billy Joel, Paul Shea for Richard Marx.

549
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I mean, the list goes on, but when he was just starting out, this was like roughly 79. He had a little bit of time on his hands in between the sessions.

550
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And so Tommy Merolda began making his own music, one analog track at a time, vocals drums guitar. He called this one man band The Tom's.

551
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Now, Billbora Magazine called the independent album that he released back in 1979, the best power pop album of the decade, and it's a hot collector's item today.

552
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Now, while he's put out a lot more music by the times, as well as his other band, the horizontal ladies club, kind of that name.

553
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Most of his time has been spent producing performing songwriting with musicians, like 50 albums worth.

554
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You know, share, both of Richie Simbora's LPs, but it was his Grammy nomination for best album of original score written for a motion picture for his work on the movie Stan alive,

555
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:38,000
that brought his music talent to a lot of movies, like, oh, days of thunder, carmen, once in the life, and this most recent Rocky Belboa picture, also the upcoming Evan Almidey, the sequel to Bruce Almidey.

556
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So, okay, so you're thinking, okay great, the guy's talented, he's got lots of talent, he's done stuff, okay, what's the big deal?

557
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Because he totally gets the independent artist.

558
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:55,000
He's part of this new media revolution where independent artists are starting to blossom all over the place, and he's focused on Las Vegas because that's where he's located now,

559
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
and he's mentoring a lot of independent artists.

560
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Like, for example, Junior Anthie, Sex League, Fletch, AMV, randomized, and he brought music by Las Vegas rapper D John and the killers in on the Rocky Belboa picture and featured their music.

561
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So, you're going to hear a lot more of him and probably a lot more indie music coming out of that Vegas area, because it's heating up.

562
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And he also has somehow figured out time to put together a new Tom's album, and that's coming out shortly.

563
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
He wants the lettuce, have a taste of it, and so that's what we're playing today.

564
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Thank you, Jersey Todd.

565
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Thank you, Adam.

566
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Have a safe trip to New York.

567
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Happy food bar Friday, everybody.

568
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Here's Tommy Marolda.

569
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
The Tom's with adventurous kind.

570
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Hey.

571
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000

573
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
but you never know the answer.

574
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

575
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I am the adventurous kind, and I have no will, I have no mind.

576
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Just wanna get some, tell me when we did better,

577
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
and got a lot of attention, come and watch it now, tell me damn it, but you never know the answer.

578
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

579
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

580
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

581
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

582
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

583
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

584
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

585
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

586
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

587
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

588
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

589
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

590
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

591
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

592
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

593
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

595
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I am the adventurous kind, ever know what I might find.

596
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

597
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might think.

598
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

599
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

600
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I am the adventurous kind, never know what I might find.

601
00:40:37,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

602
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

603
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:54,320
You sing a bit of a song of Gooni B-Wid, Knee Bassie,

604
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:00,800
Thank you so much for filling in for the Toddster amazing. What a factory over there in Jersey

605
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,400
All right, so definitely a food bar Friday

606
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,320
So a kind of a food bar last thought then just you know going back to

607
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,960
Thinking about how we indeed mind of convinced ourselves of this global warming thing

608
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,600
This global warming crisis and it may not be true at all

609
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,160
Yet four billion dollars a year of government money is spent on research on global warming each year in the United States alone

610
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,760
So I think we have to look at this as uh, perhaps possibly a classic example of

611
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,400
The game of telephone and I think it was Thanksgiving that I played in this last and it had been quite a while before then

612
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,840
But even grown up adults sitting right next to each other can't reliably pass off information from one to next because by the time the original message

613
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,840
Comes back round full circle

614
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,240
Obviously it says something completely different and it could be quite the opposite

615
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,000
Particularly if prompted by administration such as out of that sure so

616
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,840
Try and see that if you will and that will be my final thought of the week

617
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,080
Okay, daily source code calm that is working. Thank goodness

618
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,240
So that's where you can find the show notes for today's episode and hopefully by well

619
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
I can I just check during the song

620
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,680
Gmail likes to update once an hour on pop and it brings in 200 messages at a time so sometime

621
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,120
In May you'll be able to email me again. My everybody football

622
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,120
Another pod show podcast stick it in your ear

623
