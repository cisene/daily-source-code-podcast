00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,100
With the International Popularity of the Daily Source Code, we would like to welcome all

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,220
our English speaking friends to the DSC 602.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,000
And of course to our Roman friends, welcome to the DSC DC I.I.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now who decides to walk?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Who decides to pace?

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And their language less?

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Did we ever know?

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
For all we ever knew?

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's just like with your house.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Before we fall in the oven, we are in the oven.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're on the endless corner.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
On the oven and find you.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Who belongs to me.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Once marked by such a big city.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But now you're fondless.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
How did I use to sleep for all I ever saw?

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It was just a marvellous.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Before we fall in the oven, we are in the oven.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We're on the endless corner.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
On the oven and find you.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Before we fall in the oven, we are in the oven.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
On the endless corner.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
On the oven and find you.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
On the endless corner.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
On the endless corner.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
On the endless corner.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
On the endless corner.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
On the endless corner.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
On the endless corner.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
On the endless corner.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
On the endless corner.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
On the endless corner.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
On the endless corner.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
On the endless corner.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
On the endless corner.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
On the endless corner.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
On the endless corner.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,560
All I've got is only for me,

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:43,600
I've been calling for the greatest corner of my life

45
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:57,200
I've been calling for the greatest corner of my life

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,200
To grow one of the weeks of the past

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,200
To let a night in this crime turned over

48
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:16,200
But I've tied a time to grow one of the weeks of the past

49
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,200
But I don't know if it's time to turn over

50
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,200
The end of the time

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,200
They hail from Australia now available on the Podsaf Music Network

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
But getting a lot of pod play recently

53
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
So I thought, what the heck?

54
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Give it a spin!

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Plastic, Palace, Alice

56
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Gotta say, one of the better names, Empire Falls

57
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Let's see their bio here on the PMN

58
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Hail from Melbourne, Australia, since 2005, the six-piece

59
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Led by brooding songsmith Rob McDowell has been in

60
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Chanting audiences across the country

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,200
And as this year, it's debut LP entitled The Great Depression

62
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,200
What is this noise?

63
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Welcome to Daily Source Code episode number 602

65
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Coming to you from Gilford, it is the middle of the week

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Got a exciting fun dinner plan for the evening with Super Agent Keith Bishop

67
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Is something still on?

68
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
I can hear something

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Sounds like a pair of headsets is open somewhere

70
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
I'm sorry to bore you with this

71
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
I hate it

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Okay

73
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,200
The lady is going with me, the lady Patricia

74
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,200
And it's great because Super Agent Keith is going to be working with us

75
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
What is going on here today?

76
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Hello, hello

77
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Shit, you know, sometimes as someone comes in the middle of the night

78
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
And just does stuff

79
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Twiddles my knobs

80
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Okay, so Super Agent Keith

81
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
That's the dinner tonight

82
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,200
And you know, I'm having a great time doing some of the pre-production

83
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
This Afghanistan trip

84
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
In fact, I'm now at the stage where I'm thinking

85
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
You know what?

86
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Maybe I could do a double whammy and ship Trinity

87
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Over to the desert as well

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
We could have all

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Our own transportation

90
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
And how obscene is that

91
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Having a

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Petroleum

93
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
A non-petroleum based automobile

94
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Writing on top of the world's biggest oil fields

95
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Must think about it

96
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
So we've got conversations with

97
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Broadcasters for TV special

98
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
That's always fun

99
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
I still haven't spoken to all the logistics people about

100
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
What kind of connectivity they'll have

101
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
I mean at that point and this will be

102
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
What is it week 39?

103
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Typical military shit week 39

104
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
I have to delve into my calendar

105
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Couldn't you just say like September the land of the third week of September

106
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
That would be a lot easier

107
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,200
By then I think the plus will be up and running

108
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I know we've talked about that before

109
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
If you don't know what that is

110
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Ask some other listener

111
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
So we might be able to go live

112
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
And I think that will be very exciting

113
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Particularly from the Condahar camp

114
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Which I believe has international presence

115
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
So you know working on it

116
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Petrishes is she's off the hook man

117
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
She's organizing all I mean what an extra have again

118
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
And they're doing some

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Big important

120
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Maritime slash military thing

121
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
On what is it June

122
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,200
I think it's June six or no

123
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
I don't know

124
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I don't know

125
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
I need to I need help here

126
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
I don't need an assistant

127
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
To now track both of our calendars

128
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Make sure that we're in the same hemispere

129
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Let alone I guess

130
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Well we're both in the same hemispere

131
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
But certainly not in the same time zone

132
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Oh my goodness

133
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
There's definitely something different here

134
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Well fuck it

135
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Anyway

136
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
I witnessed the pod save music network

137
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
From the artist angle for the first time

138
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Of course I've only played stuff

139
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
When I play something I reported

140
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Patricia is now receiving reports on number of spin

141
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
She's getting from the pod save music network

142
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Members who use the network

143
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Of course not all necessarily from pod show

144
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,200
And you know I played like ten different intros and outros for her

145
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,200
And she was you know actually I should play this is this was so funny

146
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Let me just see if I can find it for a second

147
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,200
There was a show and I can't let me see if I have it on my desktop

148
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
I can't quite remember

149
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Oh my goodness

150
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Is it intro that I call it that maybe

151
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Shit

152
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
All of a sudden it all becomes difficult

153
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Where did I put this thing home on maybe

154
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,200
It's like there's too many places to put stuff that I put it in

155
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
In my documents

156
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Oh wait a minute here it is

157
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
It'll be no shit

158
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
That's not either

159
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Oh man

160
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Well I think I might have to give up

161
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Okay

162
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Anyway there was one guy who played it on his show

163
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
And he said that the whole song reminded him of the sound of a p51

164
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
So we've mixed in this a p51 flying overhead

165
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
And then started this song

166
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
But it was it's going to be one of those days isn't it?

167
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Oh fuck that's the that's the producer

168
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Fuck I got to call him back later

169
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Sorry it's our time can't have anyone interrupting

170
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Unless they're an official subante of course

171
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,200
So Patricia is on the pod music countdown top ten

172
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
And of course she cut a

173
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
You know a cut a promo for the show

174
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
And she got something back in the mail

175
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Which I'll play for you now which is just so cool

176
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
And just to see the sheer delight

177
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
You know she doesn't care about the sales

178
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
By the way the song is available on iTunes

179
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Worldwide now

180
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,200
So it doesn't care about selling anything necessarily

181
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Just recognition just people playing the song saying hey I really like the song

182
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Like Chris daily

183
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Hey Adam Chris daily here from the PMC top ten

184
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,200
And I just wanted to say congratulations to the lady Patricia

185
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Her song the 2007 medley remix debuted all the way up at number three

186
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,200
In the pod music countdown this week

187
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Very very impressive

188
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,200
And hey all you podcasters out there if you want to see Patricia do something Adam has never done

189
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,200

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200

So that when she does it number one

You'll be first to hear about it

196
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Patricia I know it's been a little while since you've had a number one hit

197
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,200
And hey I think you can do it with this one

198
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,200
And you know what I think this one's going to be more than all the others

199
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Because this is new media

200
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
This is the choice of a new generation

201
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Again congratulations on number three and we're looking forward to number one this week

202
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Well obviously she was beening from ear to ear

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
I found the I found the file

204
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
I found Adam Curry

205
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
It's like from Finland from Poland

206
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
It was of the coolest sounds in the evening

207
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
So check it out

208
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Anyway, I'll tell you what got me in the mood to hear the p51

209
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm listening to listening to the daily source code without a curry

210
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
See the network fucking works

211
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
It's like referral based

212
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Patricia pay and the star sisters

213
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,200
And he's got like a radio scanner on in the background

214
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Is geek like me?

215
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200

Yeah

223
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Listen to this

224
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
And then the song

225
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
And I'll be back in a couple of minutes

226
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200

237
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
This is it

238
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
And I'm going to see how I sound at the end of the show

239
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
And if I like it

240
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
I'm releasing it

241
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
This is actually

242
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I wasn't all the way

243
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
So

244
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Here we go

245
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Patricia pay and the star sisters

246
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
And here comes

247
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Sit back relax

248
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Enjoy the ride

249
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Enjoy the ride

250
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Here comes

251
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Oh

252
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Oh

253
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
I said

254
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Oh no

255
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Yeah

256
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Oh this fantastic

257
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
So

258
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
But that was really

259
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Interesting to hear that

260
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
But the hear is outro

261
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
That's what really put a smile on her face

262
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Patricia pay and the star sisters

263
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Medley remix 2007

264
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Oh my god

265
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I love that song

266
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Here you hear that

267
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
When's the last time you heard that on the radio

268
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Oh my god

269
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
I love that song

270
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Now you haven't heard that

271
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,200
That's always nice to just kind of be reminded of how cool this is that we're doing

272
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Except for the damped feedback

273
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
I'll see

274
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Low on phone calls

275
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Let me remind you guys with some numbers if you're in the UK

276
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,200
We've got a special plus four four number for you

277
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Get a pen and write it

278
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
4 4

279
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
2 0 7

280
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
6 8 1

281
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
3 7 5 3

282
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Plus 4 4

283
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
2 0 7

284
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
6 8 1

285
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
3 7 5 3

286
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Oh Adam rich man was go here

287
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Long time listener

288
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Sullivan caller

289
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Just want to leave a couple comments on five

290
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
9 6 5 9 8

291
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
And congratulations on 600

292
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I know I'm behind a little bit on my listening

293
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
5 9 6

294
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
And that's all the flight across the channel

295
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,200
If you didn't leave a puddle in your seat then you're lying

296
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Because that's not like one

297
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Collatious solos like coming back across the channel

298
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
You described it excellently

299
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I had a similar situation on one of my student

300
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Long solos where I had a fly low below the clouds

301
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
I dare say

302
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Stubborning because it's a bad thing

303
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,200
But you know you're flying that low

304
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
You have to think about twice the things

305
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Popping up out of the ground and catching your plane

306
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Yeah isn't always nasty that way

307
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
When if you go through the clouds and you're flying above the clouds

308
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
And then you want to go back down you can't find a hole

309
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
In the clouds to dive down through

310
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
You know what are you going to do?

311
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
You can call for a follow on radar service

312
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
In some cases but

313
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Essentially if you're visual flying rules you're going to go through those clouds

314
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
And guess what?

315
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Whenever you break through the clouds at the bottom

316
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
There's always a polar a mast there

317
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
It's like Murphy's law

318
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
So that was great stuff

319
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
And on five nights

320
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Before you continued

321
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
I've been so bummed out

322
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I've been waiting for a good day this week

323
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Today again is not an excellent day for a

324
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Man just it's not a good day

325
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Besides the fact that we have to leave for the city on time

326
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
So I'm hoping maybe tomorrow

327
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
And I'm going to take you guys along for the rocks

328
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I think they'll be fun

329
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
I know the acoustics always work very well

330
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
When you hear the inside of the cockpit of the plane

331
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Vibrating through your speakers

332
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,200
And at 99

333
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Work was a 99 terms for boobs

334
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
I was on a plane today flying

335
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
To New York International Airport

336
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
And I'm sitting in my seat just

337
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Confolicing and laughter and just cracking up

338
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
And I can't laugh out loud

339
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Because the guy next to me already thinks I'm a spaz

340
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
And so here I am just crying

341
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Into the world I've never laughed so much in my life

342
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
So great stuff

343
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Congratulations again

344
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Keep up the great work

345
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
I'm a folder tailwinds

346
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Take care bye

347
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Oh my friend tailwinds to you

348
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
I now I'm beaming from ear to ear

349
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,200
And I think a lot of people had that same experience with the

350
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
99

351
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Now what am I hearing?

352
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Huh?

353
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
The gardeners

354
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
The 99 words for boobs

355
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
That comes from the pod save music network

356
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Actually from an outfit called the Fump

357
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
It's Rob Balder

358
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Possible Oscar

359
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Raymond and Scum

360
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
The Great Luke's Key

361
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Tom Smith, Sudden Death, Carla Obrick

362
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Warm quartet

363
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
And some of the crazy friends

364
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
They are the Fump

365
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
The funny music project

366
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,200
And they're redefining comedy music twice a week

367
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
In fact I did it four times this week

368
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
And I've been following these guys and find the stuff they're doing

369
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,200
And I thought that maybe this one would tickle your fancy as well

370
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
So if you are particularly if you're a geek

371
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
If you're nerd and proud of it

372
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
And you're on the bus on the train

373
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Or in public

374
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Don't be prepared

375
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
You mind start to giggle

376
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
I got a hundred thousand comics

377
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Carefully collected

378
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
And all the action figures for them

379
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Carefully selected

380
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
The posters and promotions

381
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Holy superhero movie

382
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
My ring don't rank third or rent

383
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Ash saying

384
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
I got each permutation of the express

385
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
My anime collection is the finest in the nation

386
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
If you wonder why I worked so hard to get

387
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Geekread well

388
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
I can't remember either

389
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
I'll let this crap go on dead

390
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
In the third

391
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Geekly Shade

392
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Is it kinda cold now

393
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Who's in the streak of a year

394
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Is it a beat in the skin now

395
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,200
So show free full of fear

396
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Or else don't think I'm a tool

397
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,200
In the third Geekly Shade

398
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
George Lucas had Darth Vader in his High Fighter

399
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
To Stray Plus

400
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Spielberg had indie heat

401
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
He draws and richer drapes

402
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Talking sick and finement gates

403
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
And wasniac and jobs

404
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
The world is robust

405
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Can't you do send on the clinic

406
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Blobs

407
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
I act in the skills or talent

408
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
And I don't know where to start

409
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
A reality it's having

410
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Without the seven part

411
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
But I think your that could be successful

412
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Like those other nerds

413
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
As long as I've got all the toys

414
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
And shout out all the words

415
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
In the third

416
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Geekly Shade

417
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
I get it when you're DVD

418
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Now I will say

419
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Two rooms in my ear

420
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
And was undead of the rest

421
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Baby to me now

422
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Watch my cash if somebody

423
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
My credit score is three now

424
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,200
And the third Geekly Shade

425
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
I got girls and D&D

426
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Every volume and addition

427
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
I got a billion magic cards

428
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm still not a magician

429
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Costumes props and makeup

430
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Run every sign by show

431
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Where I'm made

432
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
I actually thought

433
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
That buying all this stuff

434
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Might get me laid

435
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Oh

436
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
I hear a couple of them

437
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
And so I walk around the internet

438
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Search of any plunder

439
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
And where it's going to lead me

440
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
You don't really have to wander

441
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
My finances are ruined

442
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
So I live on beats and porridge

443
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
My house is in enclosure

444
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
And my toys are all in storage

445
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
The eBay people hate me

446
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
And they will not do my bidding

447
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
And I won't go and sell the stuff

448
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Come on now

449
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Are you kidding?

450
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
But don't misunderstand

451
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
I haven't found my inner geek

452
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
I can't afford a long-drematin

453
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
All my clothes week

454
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,200
And third Geekly Shade

455
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
I want to be so cool now

456
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
It's not shit it's just weird

457
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I've been outside since you're now

458
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,200
And then I'm techy those I need

459
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Form a sleep and start to throw them out

460
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,200
And serve if you share

461
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I just wanted to say

462
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
You're right

463
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
The barbedo gets cold

464
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
I don't use you

465
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Yes, I appreciate this

466
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Or would you rather I came upstairs

467
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Insert Geekly Shade here

468
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Fund from the Fump

469
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
You can find a link to that on the show notes

470
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
A daily source code

471
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
dot com and of course

472
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Potcha dot com slash music

473
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
You can search for it there

474
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
And find another cool cool music

475
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
You can hear for free

476
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Okay, copyright crap on the on the radar once again

477
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez is pressing the US Congress to enact a sweeping intellectual property bill

478
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,200
That would increase criminal penalties for copyright infringement including

479
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Attempt to commit piracy

480
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Oh boy, this is a good one

481
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,200
So if you even attempt to even if you think about it, I guess

482
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Then the under the what is it the inter

483
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Almost second

484
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,200
It's a good article the intellectual property protection act of 2007

485
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Whenever something has protection in it

486
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,200
I always feel pretty pretty frightened

487
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Let's see anyone using counterfeit products who recklessly cause or attempt to cause death can be imprisoned for life

488
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,200
So if you have an application that was running on a hacked copy of windows and someone dies because of it

489
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
You could go to jail for life

490
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Computers can be seized more readily

491
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Okay, here's the intended copyright crimes

492
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Certain copyright crimes currently require someone to commit the distribution including the electronic means

493
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:08,200
During an any 180 day period of at least ten copies valued more than two and a half thousand the IPPA would insert a new prohibition

494
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Actions that were intended of consist of distribution intended to consist of distribution

495
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,200
So I guess if you have it on something on your hard drive and you have that connected to to the net

496
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,200
And I don't think this is good

497
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I have not looked into the whole thing. It's a whole bunch of more legal crap as a brain longest and surgersy taught our savons in the legal profession that already predicted this is you know this is going to be

498
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:46,200
The future is all it can be all kinds of big big moves and big lawsuits and trying to get jurisprudence and it's still pretty much an open play field playing field

499
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Now it's celebration, of course, of such a such crap

500
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,200
You know that I've been thinking about bringing back mashups

501
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I think we got to celebrate a little harder core, you know, I just don't see how well I'll let our friend young pull that explain it

502
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Hey Adam young pull it here, it's been a while

503
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,200
I missed your last show in DSC 601 you played the boss safe sack

504
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Well, to be honest, that got me thinking the sec part thinking

505
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,200
What if I do a hit test with

506
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Literally less than half a second of sound

507
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Will it fall within the regulations?

508
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,200
I don't know man, we can certainly try it. I mean half a second doesn't seem like much

509
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,200
But you started about everything you talked about the memories the soundtrack of your lives

510
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Yeah, and if I don't play the answers, but you still know the answers

511
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Okay, you could talk about it first

512
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Will you show you what I mean?

513
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
I'm not a lawyer. This is number one

514
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Oh, here we go

515
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Okay, y'all

516
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:15,200
It's amazing how even that short snippet lets me know it's Bruce Springsteen dancing in the dark less than half a second this is number two

517
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Okay, also another easy one

518
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Our fellow countryman here paid burns dead or alive with spitting me around and the final one number three

519
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Oh

520
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:43,200
You know the echo sounded like a short day track, so I'll just guess they sweetest have it three songs all from the 80s from 84 and 2 from 85

521
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,200
And I do have answers so if you want to get into trouble

522
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Let this play on and if you don't please

523
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Sometimes you just gotta say what the fuck stop it right now and we'll talk again hopefully

524
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,200
But if you don't mind getting into trouble, this is answer number one

525
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Oh, I'm finding the big house

526
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Funding out before Bruce Springsteen, this is dancing in the dark

527
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Not too much

528
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Still not copy this song

529
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
I

530
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Downloading protected music is killing big record companies

531
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Answer number one

532
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Oh, Springsteen from 1984

533
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Dancing in the dark and this is number two

534
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Got the 1985

535
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Dead or alive you spin me right

536
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Watch out

537
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Answer number two from 1985 dead or alive

538
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,200
And this is answer number three

539
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
The sweetest ever

540
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Another one for the kid as the memory does not fail him despite the split

541
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Three great songs from the 80s this was Sharday in the Swedish taboo three answers

542
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Less than a minute of music each and three intros less than half a second

543
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,200
I am very curious to know what you have played from this hit test in your show

544
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,200
So I hope you liked it and until next time

545
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
In full young bullet that come

546
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,200
The art of over production I love it young thank you so much my friend

547
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Yeah, for us first of all of course I played it all because I'm not a pussy however

548
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,200
I figured it out because there is a provision in the fair use articles of copyright

549
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
That allow

550
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Very use of material if it's for education

551
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,200
And I think that I've proven that the only reason I want to play old songs

552
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
I don't want to play the new Beyonce

553
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Okay, is to educate so you can hear stuff

554
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,200
You know that's as you said on this the soundtrack to our lives

555
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
You know you can't just throw this stuff away

556
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,200
And if if we don't propagate it then no one will ever hear it and the music will die

557
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
So it's all added bonus

558
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,200
I think someone who hears less than less than a minute of a song

559
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,200
And less than half a second of an intro which is quite challenging my friend

560
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
I like that

561
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I think they'll be enticed if they like the song to go learn more

562
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,200
And find out about it that you'll go to iTunes or any other service

563
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
So

564
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Ah, young

565
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Yeah, I'm thinking we ought to crank that sucker up again

566
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Hey Adam, it's Sam here from London

567
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,200
I rang in the other day about my friend's spreading Nokia mobile phone

568
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Thanks for passing on the details onto Nokia and everything

569
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
I got an email from Mark Squares at Nokia

570
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,200
He's there and he's the guy that monitors the airway

571
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
He's there any signs of

572
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Bad Nokia shit going on

573
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Yeah, he got me an email

574
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,200
And I, which I thought it on to my friend

575
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
And they, she found it yesterday afternoon

576
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
And they had a bit of a chat about what it was

577
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
He said exactly the same thing

578
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
It's got to be an aftermarket battery

579
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
That's caused a problem on the battery's accident

580
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,200
And being pissed and that would be one of the only two things that would happen

581
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,200
You said the acre don't you think of one other incident

582
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Where it actually turned out the guy at the battery and upside down

583
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,200
And then it used a nice to leave it back out and pissed the battery

584
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,200
And then it did, it, it, it, it actually did lead him

585
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
And, uh, and caused a fire

586
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Now, yeah, this is, this is some interesting information

587
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
First of all, I didn't know that Nokia has a guy

588
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Who monitors the airwaves, that's kind of cool

589
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Sitting around listening to stuff

590
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,200
I wonder if he works for the Bush administration

591
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
So that's good, so he's monitoring

592
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,200
And we got a connection, very interesting

593
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,200
That a pierced battery could actually explode

594
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Now, I don't know how much effort it takes to pierce a battery

595
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Although, obviously, Jimmying out a battery

596
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
That's been inserted upside down

597
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Or wrong way around, wrong end up or whatever

598
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Yeah, I can see what that might not be good

599
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
And I've already heard this comment

600
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,200
So listen very carefully to what he says next

601
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Nothing like this has ever happened with this sign

602
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,200
And I know that because I've had the case apart myself

603
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,200
And borrowed the battery from that sign

604
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
My own sign in the past

605
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Ah, hmm

606
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,200
I would not just pass this by lightly

607
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,200
So you actually use the battery

608
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Is it possible that someone swapped it out for an imitation battery

609
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Or mine have pierced it in some horrific manner

610
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
That's set it up to explode

611
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,200
I think this is interesting disclosure my friend

612
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
So I know that it's a original battery

613
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
It definitely is that

614
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Hmm, okay

615
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
Original battery

616
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
Hmm

617
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Still, it was removed from the case

618
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
And it wasn't your hands and in your phone

619
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,200
For an unstated amount of time

620
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Not being pierced and it's never been damaged

621
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Did you examine it upon returning?

622
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
It's just a original gear

623
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,200
And he was saying, well, the box choir, the guy from Nokia

624
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,200
He said, oh well, perhaps the phone's been intercepted by somebody

625
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
He embolled

626
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
He's just kind of covering up

627
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
It's slimy

628
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
I'm going to say your advice

629
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
I'm going to try and send the phone to engage it

630
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Or give me some guys like that

631
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
And see how we get on there

632
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
So I just thought I'd keep you up to speed

633
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
I'll speak to you soon

634
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Cheers

635
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Alright, well obviously I'm just joking around with you

636
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Taking the battery

637
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,200
But I will say I think you've done the right thing here

638
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
I disagree

639
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
I don't think it's slimy at all

640
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
I mean these guys stand by their product

641
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,200
If they truly believe that it could only have happened in under certain conditions

642
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Then I think that they're being truthful about it

643
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
And when you do send it to engage it

644
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Please profess that with the story that Nokia is not trying to hide everything

645
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
They are doing everything to

646
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
I believe they're doing everything within their power

647
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
To figure out what happened

648
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,200
And I would be surprised if you were disappointed by that experience

649
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
I don't know

650
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
But I do think it's a good idea for everyone to know

651
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,200
That there is at least one exploding Nokia phone

652
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
That is under investigation

653
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
But please be careful

654
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
You know it's like

655
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,200
I don't know if you've been following this girl who is abducted

656
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
From her parents vacation home in Portugal

657
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Melanie

658
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,200
This shit is on the news for over a week now

659
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Every single morning, noon and night

660
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
And while I appreciate how horrible

661
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
It's a really horrific it is

662
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
You know this stuff always

663
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Sprouts off bad shit

664
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
One of them being

665
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
The news were saying yesterday

666
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
They have a suspect

667
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
They can't arrest them yet

668
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Or they can't hold them

669
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Or they all had a different story

670
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
And it's the guy next door

671
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
Who happens to be a Brit

672
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
I don't know anything about the guy

673
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,200
But I do know how stories get out that you're a suspect

674
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Or you're suspected of something

675
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
And how the press just fucking runs with it

676
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
While another 50 people died in Iraq

677
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Yesterday

678
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,200
You know there's a significant other things to be tuned into

679
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
I was watching

680
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
This was another amazing thing on television last night

681
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Geez, I didn't even know I didn't even know

682
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,200
I always suspect these things

683
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
But Bob Geldoff

684
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Sir Bob Geldoff and Bono

685
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
We're in Germany

686
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
To basically complain and say hey look

687
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
We had this live eight

688
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
It was at Glennie Goals

689
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
We had the Glennie Goals summit

690
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Took place

691
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
And all of these countries

692
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
Promise debt reduction

693
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
To develop to the developing world

694
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Developing nations

695
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,200
And so far

696
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,200
The UK has lived up to their promise

697
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
I'm sorry I forgot one other country

698
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,200
But the big violators or the largest violator

699
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Of all was Germany

700
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
And they really just haven't

701
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Done their job they haven't

702
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
You know

703
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Installed the debt relief

704
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
And what I thought was really really good

705
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
On Bono and Geldoff's part

706
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Is they were saying look

707
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
There's a huge credibility issue here

708
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
We have a credibility issue

709
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
If Germany isn't pay up

710
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
That's it

711
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
We can't go before any other

712
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
World stage and try and raise money

713
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
For any other cause

714
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
And Germany looks like shit

715
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
That's all right

716
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Podgeau's moving into Germany soon

717
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
So we'll kick that country into shape

718
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Looking forward to it

719
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
And Bono said

720
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
If there were 10 million children

721
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,200
We're going to die in the UK this year

722
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Then you would not be able to

723
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
To burn that off of the front pages

724
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
He said but reality is 10 million children

725
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Will die this year

726
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Do two starvation

727
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
And he says there should be no difference

728
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Between where child lives a child is a child

729
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Shit man

730
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
I just you know

731
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Where little screwed up still with our priorities

732
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
And it's only because what's being offered

733
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
So let's not forget to use podcast

734
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
And to expose other thoughts

735
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Other forms of

736
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
All their life forms for that matter

737
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
All right

738
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
All right

739
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Oh, this is another one had a lot of part of play

740
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
That caught my eye the Alice project

741
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
I'm having a great day

742
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
And you know

743
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
I'm in

744
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Sun on my shoulder

745
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
And smile on my face

746
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Nothing

747
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Can't bother me

748
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
I'm thinking about you

749
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Sweet

750
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Ember

751
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Skipping down the street

752
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Where

753
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
Can't kind of bother me

754
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Deep in my head

755
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
No one can take it

756
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Feel it over

757
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
And I'm feeling okay

758
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
And I'm having a great

759
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Having a great

760
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Having a great day

761
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
I'm walking on water

762
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
And I'm feeling good

763
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
And you know

764
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
I know how low no weight

765
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Just on it won't happen

766
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
Oh great day

767
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,200
So much to share

768
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Feel it so high

769
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
About you

770
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,200
I think I have some some to share

771
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Skipping down the street

772
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Where some kind of bother me

773
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Deep in my head

774
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
No one can take this

775
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Feel it over

776
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
And I'm feeling okay

777
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Because I'm having a great

778
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200

779
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Having a great

780
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Having a great day

781
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Walking on water

782
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
I'm still feeling good

783
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
And you know

784
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
I know how low no weight

785
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Just on it won't happen

786
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Oh great day

Oh my baby

804
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:34,200
All right, so Lady Patricia's got a smile in her face.

805
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,200
I've got a smile in my face and this song should have put a smile on your face.

806
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Well, clearly my work is done for today.
