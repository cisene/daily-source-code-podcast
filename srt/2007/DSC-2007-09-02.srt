Hey, this is Michael Butler from the Rock and Roll Geek Show.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Check out one of my favorite TV shows this summer,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Bow Dog Music Battle of the Band.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's a competition with Johnny Rotten as one of the judges,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and that is quality television, my friends.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000

I like to drink outside, you should drink.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll just take this out of the curry.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
All right, just don't know if I can spit in.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I've got a lot of things to pack.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's the ESN608.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,440
mash up with Madonna's and ray of light. It's

64
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:30,000
right of god. Well, that's a classic GHP mash up found just the other day at

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,680
mashuptown.com. Hey, everybody, how you doing? Welcome to the daily source code

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,280
episode number. Uh, 658 coming to you from the curry manner on the

67
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,000
east side, east side on the west side of G town in the affluent suburb of

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Surrey known as Gilford. All right. Uh, okay. I might as well just kick it right off with

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,200
uh, with uh, the nylon because he's so right. Adam, I'm alive and kicking it for my

70
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,960
long. Down here, the elder ray, which is the fire island of France. And you have me

71
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,760
crying in my rosÃ© about you giving up the daily source code. Hey, guy, you haven't done a

72
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,120
daily daily source code since April. What's the tears about? You know, it's different.

73
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,000
Your audience is the same. You know, it's changed. No serious and no splendor to pay

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,960
you to get up in the morning and deliver or show as you promise on the day you

75
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,200
promised. So don't give me this about your commitment to the audience. The audience

76
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,840
is the same. It's serious that's gone. So let's not all the promise and under

77
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,000
deliver. Oh, nylon, you hurt me so badly with that. How can you possibly suggest that

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,360
that my lack of source code has anything to do with money? If it had to do with money by

79
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,200
friend, I would close down my company and I would just do this show exclusively. I think

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:58,240
I could do just fine as nothing to do with money. But your point, your point is made. I don't

81
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,040
know if I've over promised and under delivered. I think I've just promised and not come

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,280
through. We'll come back to that. Just go to two shows a week, Tuesday, Friday or three

83
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,240
shows, promise that and deliver that so that when we look for you, you're there. I know

84
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,760
it's good for your download request. There's to be looking for your five days a week and

85
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,320
only show up too. Oh, you doork. Of course, it doesn't do anything for my download

86
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,520
request. If there's no shows to download, hey, football Friday on Sundays, I'm supposed

87
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,320
to be doing the time shifting. Not you. So go to what you can deliver and then keep it.

88
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,800
You know, it's never done a daily daily source code since serious stop paying you to get

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,680
up. But the audience is still here. So, you know, make a commitment with us and live

90
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,600
up to it. You know, you're a busy guy. Uncle Don. Uncle Don.

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,520
I don't. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh, nylon. That's a hardest part. The only commitment

92
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,080
I can make is that I'm committed. My friend, it has been and I warned you. I warned you

93
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,080
this week would be just outrageously busy and it was and Friday. Oh, man. I didn't get

94
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,560
home until, uh, the same as Thursday, really nine o'clock. And I was so tired. I just, you

95
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,000
know, I'd rather not do a show than do a half-ass show. You gotta, you gotta understand

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,640
that and you, you gotta appreciate that. Besides, the only person who seems to be crying

97
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,080
about it is me, actually. Anyway, here's your jingle, buddy.

98
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,600
Let's have a word with the nylon spreading and news with the smile on where the roll

99
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,720
all right. Ringo for light. Let's listen world of wild to the nylon. Yeah. I'm not

100
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,160
going to even play the part of what Uncle Don, because I've already been through all that.

101
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,960
Oh, yes. Uh, I wound up with a meeting at six o'clock Friday night in London in the short

102
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:56,840
it's UK office with Pixie Geldoff. Now, uh, the, the last name, of course, will, uh, we'll

103
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,280
probably ring a bell. Uh, her dad is indeed Bob Geldoff. And, uh, her older sister

104
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,480
peaches is, uh, that's, I saw her, uh, present a big brother, big mouth show over here, which

105
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,240
is kind of like a, right after the big brother show, then they have a kind of a funky, like

106
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,520
talk show thing going on, uh, with guest hosts of scene peaches. And she's, she's around

107
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,040
town. She's, of course, of drinking age, I believe. So that's why she's around town

108
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:26,960
and in the papers. And Pixie is, uh, I think 17. And, uh, that was kind of interesting.

109
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,640
Uh, I'm like, I'm, I'm sitting here and I think I'm having a business meeting with

110
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,640
someone, the same age as my daughter with, with a, uh, man, I wish I'd taken a picture

111
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,960
of her, uh, her agent or her manager. Oh, my goodness. His guy, uh, he was, he was a, he was

112
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,360
a real one, you know, black slacks, black shoes, uh, trousers worn just a little bit too

113
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,040
hot. He was kind of like an older Simon, Simon call. Anyway, it was very interesting. Uh,

114
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,840
once I asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up, then all of a sudden, then all

115
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,680
of a sudden, like, it's easy and passion. We had some to talk about. Anyway, so I was just

116
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,400
way too tired to do anything Friday. Um, even though, uh, yes, I, I even posted Thursday.

117
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,920
I think the last time I'm going to encourage calm that I was going to do a show. So I'm

118
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,720
sorry. I really do a problem, apologize.

119
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,600
Let me see, uh, good news. Uh, there was a couple of different good things. I believe, um,

120
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,520
number one with the bullet. One, a parsec award at, uh, where's the Dragon Khan? I

121
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,600
think is what it is. Congratulations to a, uh, Mark Yoshimoto Nemkoff. Also, uh, games

122
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,840
Weasel. Now, you've heard games Weasel, uh, promo on this show. It's a big show for us

123
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,920
here in the UK. It's audio only. It's a Mac Cuddle who does, uh, uh, this audio show about

124
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:47,040
video gaming and, uh, just kind of email, uh, uh, late in the week that games Weasel has

125
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,520
been nominated for the 2007 GMA games media awards, one of the five finalists in the games

126
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,800
podcast segment. How? By the way, there's something really messed up. I, for those of you

127
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,760
in the UK, there's the digital music awards, um, which is sponsored, uh, by BT. I think

128
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,520
maybe even in part by BT Pod Show. And this, they have a podcast category, um, that I'm just

129
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,280
going to have to distance myself from, uh, oh, man. I tried to tell them that it was, the way

130
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,120
for was not to nominate all mainstream podcasts. And I just, this is where the two cultures

131
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,760
just kind of clashed. So, um, for those of you, uh, you know, I, I, we'll get into a deep. I got to

132
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,440
talk to the BT people about it. But I've already gotten several emails of people questioning

133
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,600
what the heck is going on. Uh, so obviously we had no involvement in that. And, uh, I, I don't

134
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,680
think we can, well, I'm excited about the digital musical awards because it gives us a great

135
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,320
opportunity to do some live stuff. Uh, we always have the, uh, very awesome. We last year, we

136
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,600
had a great party. Uh, we were live for, I don't know, like a seven or eight hours red carpet,

137
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,440
uh, lots of celebrities. That's going to happen again this year. It's taking place in, uh, I think

138
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,080
it's, uh, mid October. Uh, so, uh, looking forward to that, but not to the, uh, to the actual

139
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:15,280
category as a, a four mentioned. Um, the girls are gone. It is indeed Sunday night. It's, uh,

140
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,200
10, 25 tomorrow morning. I leave right in early for San Francisco. Not only is it Labor Day tomorrow,

141
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,120
which is kind of why I chose Monday, no one would have to leave on a Sunday, uh, but since

142
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,280
there'll be no one working on Monday, I figured out it'll be nice to travel. I think it'll be nice

143
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,920
to travel on Labor Day. Everyone just kind of staying home. I hope that also happens to be my birthday.

144
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:42,960
It was the third of September that day to I was remember, uh, hey, that reminds me that is a

145
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,920
part of the soundtrack of my life. Maybe Yon Polet has one from yours.

146
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,000
Hey, Adam, this is, uh, hit us number 85. Hey, babe. Again, I have, uh, selected three great

147
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,120
tricks from the eddy. So here we go with intro number one.

148
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:26,560
And number two. Oh, I know that one. Oh, I love that one. That's, um, Ryan Paris Dolce Vita.

149
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,080
God, that's like a summer hit from 1981. I think, for 80 minutes. And the final one is number three.

150
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:42,320
That's, uh, first win in fire. Uh, I'm going to guess Boogie Wonderland, but I'm not sure.

151
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,440
And I can't figure out the first one. And these are the answers. Number one is Joe Kucker.

152
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,360
Damn.

153
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,640
Answer number one.

154
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,800
Oh, Kucker from 1987, and this is number two.

155
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,440
Yeah, 1983, right in first. This is Dolce Vita.

156
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Oh, man, the spring's back memories of Sarka.

157
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,880
Right, Paris, and Dolce Vita is answer number two.

158
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,280
And this is answer number three.

159
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,240
Oh, no, it's from 1981, earth, wind and fire.

160
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,800
And this is no, no, no, no, no.

161
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,440
All right, wasn't Boogie Wonderland. I can have stars for that, no, not you.

162
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,480
As love goes on, earth would inspire, as answer number three.

163
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,800
And that concludes hit test number 85. Excellent.

164
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,480
Alrighty, three great tracks from the 80's again. Adam, I hope you liked them. And you'll, I guess, the

165
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,800
them all right. Next week, I'll be back for hit test number 86.

166
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,440
And until then, the answers to this hit test. And of course, the links to the music and

167
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,880
iTunes can be found at hittest.partshow.com. Alrighty, thanks for playing Adam.

168
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,600
Until next week, take care and bye bye.

169
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,120
I can't believe I missed Joe Cocker. That's, uh, that's almost unforgivable. Okay, I got, I don't,

170
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,000
I only, I got earth's wind fire, right? I didn't get the song right, but oh, yeah, and I love it.

171
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,080
I love those hit tests, man. It makes me feel good. That took me back to, it was 83, I guess.

172
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,200
I thought it was earlier. The summer of 83, uh, I was on the pirate radio station radio

173
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,600
decibel in Amsterdam. And, uh, that was such a hit. It was a warm warm summer. And we just

174
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,320
played that Ryan Paris Dolce Vita song over and over and over again. That was fantastic.

175
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,280
And of course, you can find links to all of the songs and all of the hit tests. We have 85 of them

176
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,120
now in total. That's been going for quite a while. Hey, y'all, what are we going to do for 100?

177
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,880
We got to do some special dude. You can find all those at hittest.podshow.com. All we're talking

178
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:55,120
about iTunes. A lot of, uh, back and forth, uh, in the press between NBC and Apple. Uh, it's, it's almost,

179
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:01,760
it's, it's kind of sad. It's like watching a bad breakup. So I guess what, what's happening is that NBC

180
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,840
and Apple couldn't agree on how they were going to extend their contract after, um, I think December,

181
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,600
where NBC wants, uh, flexible retail pricing so that they can basically, um, and, and I can

182
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,880
understand what they're coming from, by the way. They, they want to package things. I want to put

183
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,400
tracks together. They want to make special, uh, packaging deals. And I can understand because that

184
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,800
is kind of in their blood. Unfortunately, um, not only is that not in, in Apple's blood or

185
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:36,960
an iTunes, DNA is really, um, it's, yeah, you know, it's, it's, it's kind of, it's not the way geeks

186
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,520
think. Yeah, we think geeks think pretty linearly by one track, 99 cents. Now, everyone has argued

187
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,200
that Apple doesn't make any money off of the actual media sales anyway. And even if they do,

188
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,360
the point is that with mainstream content, uh, you know, the minute you have a great model for

189
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,080
reselling or packaging and distributing it, and you start to make some money, you know, what's

190
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,440
going to happen is they're going to raise the prices on you. They're going to start cutting you off.

191
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,560
That's just the way it works. You know, record companies these days are so desperate, so desperate.

192
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,800
They're there even trying now to get, uh, 50% of all proceeds from, uh, merchandise and, uh,

193
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,440
um, from, uh, concert performances. I mean, the desperate, the model is just over, you know,

194
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,640
give it up already. And so, you know, Steve Jobs, although a fantastic CEO, uh, you know,

195
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,440
no doubt about it. What he's been doing with Apple before he was kicked out of an after he came

196
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,040
back, is just stellar. And he's a very nice guy. I find him to be somewhat introverted and

197
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,520
timid personally, even though that looks quite different on stage. Um, I had, uh, the pleasure of

198
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,920
a, about an hour and a half, uh, private conversation with him before, um, iTunes launched with the

199
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,360
podcast and capabilities in it. And he was really endearing. And I know he listens to this show

200
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,960
from time to time, more at least he's got people who cut out segments and seven to a more

201
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:10,160
set of a pointer. Um, so here's my advice, you know, Steve, you are not a show business guy.

202
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,480
In fact, I would have to say that you are a several levels, levels higher on the social

203
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,520
latter. And I'll show, although show business seems very sexy. And yes, I know you're in Pixar

204
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,000
and, you know, you're on the board of Disney. And it's different, you know, it's different

205
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,320
down in the trenches where, you know, the asshole of the industry, which is basically with a money,

206
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,320
gets taken in and, and the bullshit pooped out. It's very different down there.

207
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,080
And, um, I don't understand why you, you know, enough already, you know, if they want to go

208
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,360
off and sell it on to Hulu or Zulu or whatever their website is, let them go do that. That's fine.

209
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,840
They're going to do it anyway. And that's probably what's, what's 50% of the whole breakup

210
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,120
is about is they want to be able to just sell it on their site and not have to deal with you.

211
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,480
But, look at the world of independent media Steve. Look at all of the reports that are coming out.

212
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,800
Look at what people are saying that they really want. Look at where they're gravitating towards.

213
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,360
Look at what they're moving away from. They're moving away from mainstream.

214
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,320
They're looking for alternatives. They're looking for new things and new series and, and really

215
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,760
episodic content they can latch on to and become a part of and contribute. And you've got the

216
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,040
perfect infrastructure for it. And if indeed you don't really make all that much money on, on, on,

217
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,000
on the content sales itself. And in, of course, in the future, you probably won't anyway.

218
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,120
What do you have to lose by supporting independent media? Really supporting it. You know,

219
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,680
that was the, the one disappointment, understandable. But the one disappointment when Apple

220
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:51,280
came out with podcast and capability, they really started to promote a lot of mainstream content,

221
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,280
a lot of NPR. And although it is fantastic content, you know, there's so much more that can be done.

222
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:05,440
Really, really, so much more. And they would support you. They really, they're already supporting you.

223
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,160
Independent producers, the world over our supporting iTunes with the tags that they put in with

224
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,760
trying to get listed, you know, trying to do a really good job to get, you know, more subscribers

225
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,760
and into your top 10 lists, even though it's kind of fuzziest of how those work,

226
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,120
it doesn't matter. You know, they will support it. Give it up. Let's fuck those guys. Really,

227
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,720
for years, I tried to change the thought of the mainstream until about three years ago. I just

228
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,640
fuck it. Let's just do what our, let's just, let's just show them how it's done. We'll build an

229
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:44,000
entire parallel industry if we have to. That's the word of the day Steve. Just fuck them.

230
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:52,800
Fuck them. Oh, my, I think, oh my gosh, Adam Curry. This is Dan Johnson from Cincinnati, Ohio.

231
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,600
You know, I started listening to the daily source code back around July, early August of 2005.

232
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:07,840
And you were, you were using the rock money now, opening back then, hearing it on DSC 656 from August

233
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,360
27, 2007. Oh my gosh, I just brought you a talk about the soundtrack to your life. Man, I'm just

234
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,360
saying that applies me out so much, brother. You rock, you like the house, man. Thank you so much.

235
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,040
That's nice, man. I appreciate it. Oh, by the way, what while I'm talking about Apple, just a bit

236
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,880
about the iPhone, it has the touch screen is still not come back to life, unfortunately. I think

237
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,840
that is gone forever. So that is a bummer. And that does put me in the middle of a quite a

238
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:42,800
conundrum. Or should I call it a dilemma? Adam Jason from San Diego. So you lost your iPhone

239
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:50,880
and you're going to buy probably the new iPod, but what I'd like to know is are you going to buy

240
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,640
another iPhone? Is it worth it to spend the other money? Have it. And maybe you may not use it a lot,

241
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,000
but you know, sometimes you just got to buy something to have it, would you buy another iPhone?

242
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,360
Like, yo, yo. Well, um, I'm the wrong guy to ask that particular question because, uh,

243
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,440
the cost of an iPhone, I just had to be honest. It doesn't make any difference to me left or right.

244
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,360
So I don't make my purchase based, not that type of purchase based upon, uh, do I think it's worth it?

245
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,840
Because I, what I just wanted, I really, really, really love the web browsing experience.

246
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,840
Although I've been hanging with the Nokia's for a moment. What is it now? More than a week, right? Yeah.

247
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,400
It has more, it's, yeah. It's like nine days. And the phone, of course, is working great. I have to say

248
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,800
battery power, far superior to the iPhone. The Nokia, you know, I can be using it for two days and

249
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,920
still going strong. And the 8800, I got to, uh, can't even, and Luke sent me a very nice, uh,

250
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,760
leather at wallet that wraps around it and snaps in place with the, uh, with little, uh, magnets.

251
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,280
And, uh, that that actually gives it a very professional look and feel to it. And I have been using it

252
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,480
quite a bit. Got to tell you. Um, and, uh, if, you know, it's like, I could construct the perfect

253
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,640
device that I really want. I know that for sure. It would take a whole bunch of patents to be matched

254
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,280
up together. Um, but it would be a combination of things. Anyway, um, I'll say that phone wise,

255
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:26,320
I'm very happy with my E61 India. Uh, and if Apple were to come out, uh, on, uh, was it Wednesday,

256
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,560
September 5th, they have some special announcements in Cupertino and everyone's pretty short

257
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,480
about iPods. But what if they came out with the iPhone, with the phoneless iPhone,

258
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,040
you know, if it was an iPod that also had the Safari browser and it and Wi-Fi and, uh, man,

259
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,480
would I dig it? Yeah. Would I buy it? Definitely.

260
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:58,320
Sugar, sugar, sugar, Adam here, the sugar, sugar. Stop. Just for a moment.

261
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:05,600
Imagine that you're wife and mother who has been manipulated or experienced physical or emotional

262
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,200
abuse. Imagine the concerning half for your kids because you hope that they are not next.

263
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,640
Well, maybe you've seen a progress to your child and it hasn't get come to you.

264
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,600
Imagine all the times you've heard your partner say he wants to change,

265
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,960
knowing that he hasn't. Imagine trying to muster up the courage to get out of this situation.

266
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,680
Imagine the anxiety and fear you feel as you look around your home,

267
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,440
because you know you're going to leave so many things behind.

268
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:45,040
Maybe it's hard for you to imagine what this is like, but maybe you certainly can relate

269
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,920
with the feeling of being powerless. My name is Daniel Johnson Jr., and I produce a podcast from

270
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:58,560
Cincinnati, Ohio. Even more importantly, I'm a person and a member of the community.

271
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,240
The same way victims of domestic violence and abuse are. I know I'm not alone and wanting to do

272
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:15,680
something about it. Here are two things you can do. Number one, on Sunday, September 9th, 2007,

273
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,080
people all over the Cincinnati area will be joining together to raise one voice for domestic violence

274
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,280
awareness. Please come join us as saw your point along the Ohio River. Money's raised will help

275
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,800
families leaving the local battered women's shelter to start over. Find out more information

276
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:43,600
at onevoicewalk.org. Number two, become part of the growing online community that is raising one voice.

277
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:52,640
Check out myspace.com slash one voice walk for more information. Thank you very much.

278
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:01,920
More than welcome my friend. This morning my inbox was filled with two types of email.

279
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:09,280
One was an apparent invite from all of my friends to join the social network catch-up

280
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,480
spelled in a rather peculiar manner. Quebec Uniform Echo Charlie Hotel Uniform Papa.

281
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,280
And the other half of the contents of my inbox, at least the visual part, was apologies from people

282
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:29,280
saying, oh man, shit, I can't believe I signed up for this and it sucked out all my email addresses.

283
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:37,520
Need mail down my friends. It's like double the amount of spam. Wow, what a virus, huh?

284
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:45,520
A awesome, awesome, awesome social virus. Very, very simple. All the did was, is it just kind of

285
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,640
didn't tell you that, oh my second, was that the, I'm looking, I waited for a text message from my

286
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,800
girls on a batteries full, charging the Nokia. Yeah, you know, so if you, if you run into

287
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,800
some kind of social network that you're going to sign up to and by the way, all these things are

288
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:10,160
viruses as far as I'm concerned, if you know how many invites I get to Twitter is now gone,

289
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:20,320
pounds, how many friend requests I get from my space, how many friend additions from Facebook,

290
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,680
how many people are asking for connections on LinkedIn? I'm sick and tired of it. It's just annoying.

291
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,920
It really is. And now this ketchup thing, which I guess you sign up for it and then it says,

292
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
oh, you know, we're just going to check and see if any of your other friends are already on,

293
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,960
and then we'll like hook you up automatically, which is also just fucking annoying. It really is.

294
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,520
I do not want to be your friend. Stop sending these invites. I'm not joining. You know,

295
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,080
I don't have time to do a show. Let alone manage my friends on all these different social networks.

296
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:11,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see what else was there. Oh, so the wing commander did I even tell you

297
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,040
the story about, I don't know if I told, I'm blanking for a second. I don't think I've told the story.

298
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,840
So I was supposed to get the the Delta Sierra. I don't know,

299
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,520
yeah, I think I did. No, I can't remember that I did I talk about it with Patricia on Sunday,

300
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:34,400
show anyway. I was supposed to get the Delta Sierra last weekend, but they needed a flying

301
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:42,400
station wagon, which is declassification of aircraft we own. The 182 retractable. Because the 182

302
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,880
they had set up to do, I think it was, if it wasn't the make a wish foundation, it was comparable

303
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,800
to the make a wish foundation. We're going to fly some kids around Rotterdam last Saturday.

304
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,640
The plane that they had set up for that, they were, they had just rebuilt the engine. They had flown

305
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,800
four hours. This is the wing commander William. And he was a parked at grass field eating muscles.

306
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,240
The only plane on the field except for a glider who was pulled up on a cable. And I guess he

307
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,760
went off the center line. So he kind of veered off and then he dropped the cable and the cable

308
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,640
came down and sheared the wing. So they needed the Delta Sierra to to cover. So not a problem.

309
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,640
And so this past Saturday, the wing commander showed up right in early and brought it back. And so

310
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,880
had a nice flight taken him back to Antwerp and then solo back over the channel, which was,

311
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,600
oh, it was so nice. I got to tell you, I'm at that point. Do you remember when you learned how to

312
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,640
drive when, you know, and it's usually after just time. And in this case, it's also time. It's just

313
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,320
hundreds of hours of flying. Where you feel like, okay, you know, lots of stuff can happen.

314
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,920
And there's all kinds of things that have to be aware of, particularly other drivers and conditions.

315
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,440
But I have this vehicle under control. And that's the way I feel now about my flying. You know,

316
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,400
and I'm at the point where I feel just as comfortable in a helicopter.

317
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,800
And the fixed wing is I do in a helicopter. And it's really, it's, it's, it's almost like it's

318
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,120
invigorating. It's like a drug. You know, you just, I get so psyched up. Oh, yeah, I'm going to fly.

319
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,920
And just, and everything is always different. But I know I've got this thing. You know, I know how

320
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,640
this is my plane. It's wrapped around me like a second skin. And it's just nice.

321
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,280
So, you know, that was beautiful doing the crossing the channel solo on the way home. Then this

322
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,400
morning, I took the ladies, the divas, Patricia and Christina, who are at a fashion show or

323
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,280
word of fashion. So earlier this evening, I probably outhang and then drink and whatever. And

324
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,360
the two of them, you know, oh, man, they look like total divas packed in the back of the Delta

325
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:50,080
Sierra with the, they're big, big aviator glasses on lots of hair flowing. Flim over to Hilversum

326
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,000
and dropped them off. We had a nice, quick little lunch, saw taxi Eric. And of course,

327
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,520
I was with Captain Dan, as you know, Patricia won't fly across channel with me without a safety pilot.

328
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,320
And so we had a nice flight back. You're kind of unadventful. But it was nice.

329
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,880
Kind of good time. And I've had my fill. Thank goodness, because it's going to be two weeks

330
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,360
as of tomorrow, two weeks on the road. First to San Francisco, then I'm somewhere near, I think it's

331
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:25,440
San Diego for some, uh, what is it? I media. It's I media conference where I'm a lunchtime special speaker.

332
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:34,320
Then a quick stop. Uh, I'm actually I'm hoping to take a virgin America from San Francisco to Los

333
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,800
Angeles and then fly back from from Los Angeles. Really? Because I just want to fly

334
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,320
virgin America. They say it's like a flying iPod. I can't wait to try it out.

335
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,760
Hey, uh, what is it? 30 minutes? I got some songs I got to play for you. Hold on a second here. I got

336
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,160
Jersey Todd, which of course was a Fubar Friday special edition. Something we haven't done a long while.

337
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,080
What's playing on?

338
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,600
At this first, and I find.

339
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,840
Yes, we have not played something from the first gen iPod in a long time. I'm no longer

340
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,400
gonna put it on the summer selection since the weather is a little bit variable now. So I'm taking

341
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:16,400
off of the summer playlist. I'm just, uh, getting either rammed in here.

342
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,080
All right, it's queued up. Let's find out what's playing on Adam's first gen iPod.

343
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:34,400
What's playing on Adam's first gen iPod? Okay, you never know. Oh boy. Oh no.

barber key through here in a second is the uh... the amazingly singer this band

390
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,780

playing grenadier village in the in New York city she was signed to an am she was signed to

392

00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,780
doing those kind of things

398
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,780
so they moved off to western massachusetts they taught their son to play bass guitar

399
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,780
and they formed the stone coyotes

400
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,780
now this band we had been playing around in fact they got back out to l.a.

401

402
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:02,780
that came out be cool he found the stone coyotes and in fact dedicated be cool to them

403
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:08,780

00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,780
I went to where rivers were born

409
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,780
I threw three coins in the fountain

410
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,780
sail to the eye of the storm

411
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,780
I sat across from a wise man

00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,780
he said I'll tell you what is true

413
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,780

I saw Adam and he'd take the fall

422
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,780
I hit the ride on a spaceship

423
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,780

435
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,780

music

476
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,780
On a dark desert highway

477
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,780
Cooling in my hair

478
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,780
Once we'll complete this

479
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,780
Rising up through the air

480
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,780
Up ahead in the distance

481
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,780
I saw a shimmering light

482
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,780
I hit the heavy on my side who damn

483
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,780
I had just enough for the night

484
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,780
There she stood in the doorway

485
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,780
With her mission bail

486
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,780
And I was thinking to myself

487
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,780
This could be heaven

488
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,780
And this could be heaven

489
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,780
Then she lit up her candle

490
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,780
And she showed me the way

491
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,780
There were voices down this morning dark

492
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,780
I thought I heard them say

493
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,780
Welcome to the hotel California

494
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:05,780

00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,780
When I just dip in it twisted

500
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,780
She got the Mercedes fans

501
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,780
She got a lot of her pretty pretty boys

502
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,780
She got friends

503
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,780
How the plants in the courtyard

504
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,780
Sweep in summer's way

505
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,780
Something that's doing over

506
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,780
Something that's too forget

507
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,780
So I call her the captain

508
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,780

Since the 1960 night

511
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:06,780
And still those voices are calling from far away

512
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,780
When you have been better than night

513
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,780
