1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Dromatically reduce ambient noise by up to 85% with Sony's noise-cancelling headphones and

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
work, home or travel, shut out the noise and really enjoy your tracks.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Get yours at Sony.com slash headphones.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Sony headphones, your music never sounded so good.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'd like to think of a sign to this journey.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm just taking this out of the curry.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah, man.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Delta.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Scarrot.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Charlie.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Six, nine, or seven.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You know, Christmas Eve, this is the government.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We roll out American Heartbreak without a doubt.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This has got to be the best Christmas song ever.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Do you remember that in down the Christmas tree?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Don't remember anything for waiting for my phone to ring.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Wake up that I'm freezing.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Drinking doesn't kill my thing.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Children spinning at night window must be Christmas time again.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The stars will melt at you.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No more chance for me.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
My wish came never came.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Every is the same.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm just like, I'm gonna leave.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm gonna be like myself with my.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be by myself with my.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Live my life again.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Space another year.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You can't be a fool to battle.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I might be dead by Christmas anyway.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Christmas party.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You look the other way.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I wish I would never have gone.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
See another Christmas day.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The stars will melt at you.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No more chance for me.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I wish came never came.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Every is the same.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm just like, I'm gonna leave.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm gonna be by myself with my.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be by myself with my.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Live my life again.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be by myself with my.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the world.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No more Christmas day.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be by myself with my.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Live my life again.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm gonna be by myself with my.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Live my life again.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
See another Christmas party.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You look the other way.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I wish I would never have gone.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
See another Christmas day.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The stars will melt at you.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No more chance for me.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I wish came never came.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Every is the same.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm just like, I'm gonna be.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm gonna be by myself with my.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be by myself with my.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Christmas again.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be by myself with my.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the world.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm gonna be the world.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm gonna be the world.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't think I'll be alone.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll be alone.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll be with my girls.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's not gonna be too busy now.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The Christmas season really kicks off.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Once you've heard American Heartbreak.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Greatest Christmas song of all time on the Charlie.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
American Heartbreak of Parts.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Featuring.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm not sure it's very own.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Son of Love.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Michael Butler on this.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Everybody how you doing?

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Daily source code.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Six, nine, or seven.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Coming to you from the curry condo once again.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
In Northern California.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It is Thursday for y'all.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's Wednesday night for me.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Wow, it's later than I thought.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's 11, 30.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm feeling much better.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So, yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All systems are go.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Stuff starting to function is normal again.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And a really good day.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I spent a lot of time looking at V3.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is the new version of, of Potcha.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm not gonna say the new version of the site because it's,

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
it's a new version of Potcha, really.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Damn, there's some cool stuff.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm like, this, I couldn't even start to tell you what it is.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But it's something you'll want to use.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's not, it's not the site.

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Does that make any sense?

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Chris McIntyre is gonna do a screencast for the,

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I think for the Potcha producers.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So then they can start saying how much they love it,

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
but they won't be able to explain it either.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh boy, I was just thinking actually doing that song.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I was like, wow, you know, it's a real bummer

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
that neither Patricia or Christina.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't think they ever listened to the show.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I know she would like the, the Butler song.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I know she likes American Heartbreak.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I know that, I know she likes Michael.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And Martina.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Do you hear a hum somewhere?

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm hearing something.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hold on.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh my god, that should be better.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, much better.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And I'm just thinking about, you know,

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I, I tell so much about what's going on and what I'm thinking

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
on the show.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And I wonder, do I tell them?

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Do I forget to tell them stuff that I'm thinking sometimes

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
because I think I've already told them or told someone.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And I guess I've told you guys.

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Anyway, some of the things you gotta think about.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You know, for the past,

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I gotta say eight or nine months.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I've been receiving emails about the show called The Plugcast.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And I get asked to do interviews a lot.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I pretty much decline every single one.

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And usually mainstream interviews.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't even answer anymore.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm just not interested.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And mainly I don't do them because I know that my schedule

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
is going to get messed up.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm going to have to postpone to lay.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I hate that.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I really hate it.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So I'd rather just say no, sorry.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I can't because I'm literally just too busy.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I am busy.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Look at it.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's 11.30 in doing my show.

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And it's not like I've been hanging out.

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But I, I, when, so I think it's,

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I forget the guy's name.

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Anyway, the plugcast.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He, he had his idea of,

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't know if it's the format for the show or whatever.

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Whatever the thought behind it was,

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
you know, it's like why don't I get a whole bunch of people

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
to ask Adam to come on the show

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and have other podcasters ask him.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You know, podcasters who I presume have appeared on the plugcast.

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And you know, and the plug, I don't want to plug anything.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
First of all, I have nothing to plug.

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And I really have nothing to say.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And I really don't have the time.

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You know, or I'm sure I'll schedule the time.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And then, you know, oh, sorry.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Different time zone.

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Different continent.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, sorry.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Not going to work out.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It sucks.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I, I hate that out of everything.

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's why I usually say no.

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm getting pretty close to saying yes to the plugcast.

169
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
After Zack sent in his version of an invitation

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
for me to go on the show.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, I'm super excited about it.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You know, it's interesting about him.

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Nothing.

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What?

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, you tell me he's an asshole for me.

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No, from what he needs to.

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Like, he gives a shit.

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, I love a lot of people.

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Actually, because that's what my job entails is making sure

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
people care what he has to say.

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm interviewing him.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Wait, wait a minute.

183
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Sounds like he's a she who needs to interview me.

184
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Well, if I'd known that.

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's just me.

186
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Maybe I just don't give a shit.

187
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't think you're an asshole.

188
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm Korean.

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I do give a shit.

190
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Show some holiday spirit, Adam.

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Through a shameless plugcast interview.

192
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's a doll that keeps dropping like that.

193
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I probably will have to.

194
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If you want to stay with it and stay your cool guy,

195
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
you should go.

196
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're so right, though.

197
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah, do something with the young guys.

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah.

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And that will keep you young.

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
An example of some questions in my experience.

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Do your hobbies are drinking, smoking weed,

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and all types of ill shit.

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I like it very much.

204
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Just kidding, Adam.

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll be rain for your call.

206
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We still does that.

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And now you want to give me the freak out.

208
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Who is the plugcast?

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Is it Zach?

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Is it who sent this?

211
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Or is it who's the girl?

212
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And who's the guy who wants to tell me I'm an asshole?

213
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't know.

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm confused.

215
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So many mixed singles.

216
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Now I don't know what to do.

217
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Ah, please help me make this terribly tough decision.

218
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey, this came in a couple days ago.

219
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It kind of got stuck in a pile of doo-doo in Gmail.

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But my sister checks in from from the hills of Florence.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Italy.

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And as you know, she's a Nokia fiend like myself.

223
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
She, uh, she too has the E61 eye.

224
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And, uh, she really uses this thing.

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
She uses the VoIP, uh, I think the Gizmo client.

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, wait a minute.

227
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
She uses, um, eeeeee.

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Why am I forgetting?

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Uh, I don't know.

230
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
She uses one of those VoIP clients that kind of integrates with the, with the phone book.

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And, and when we're on vacation on, uh, uh, fire island.

232
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Is it fire island?

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Can you remember?

234
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
August.

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We were in, uh, an island somewhere in New York.

236
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I think it was fire island.

237
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Um, I saw her use it consistently on the Wi-Fi in the house that we'd rented.

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay.

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So you're going to love this story.

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hi, Adam.

241
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Sister calling in from Florence, Italy.

242
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Um, I just finished listening to your Fuber Friday.

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And actually was very, very fortunate that I was able to do so on my E61 eye.

244
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Um, this is all, I mean, theme with, uh, your listener who was asking about the, uh,

245
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
what was it the N95 or the iPhone.

246
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And he wanted to have more information.

247
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, I've got to tell him and, and, and everybody, you want an okay.

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If you're any, if you're anything like me, you want an okay.

249
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And I just had another experience that just confirmed that, um, last night, I was

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
listening to, uh, your, uh, your, uh, your Wednesday episode.

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And, uh, some listener called in and I was just, uh,

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I wanted to pump up the volume a bit because I couldn't hear so well.

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Uh, because I don't wait the, uh, the headphones.

254
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, because, uh, I didn't forgot to mention I was in the tub.

255
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And so you can feel where this is going.

256
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hold on a second.

257
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I just got a visual.

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I really didn't need to have realo.

259
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So I picked up the phone and it slipped and it went to the tub.

260
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And I also found out why the bathtub is worse than the toilet.

261
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Because if you have a bowl bath, like I do, you can't find it better.

262
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, let me tell you.

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It wasn't easy for me to find my iPhone when it slipped into the toilet,

264
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
pre-flush either.

265
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay.

266
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So, you know, and, and, and there was also obstruction going on.

267
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Find the phone.

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Anyway, so I lost a few extra precious seconds there with my Nokia in the water.

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But, uh, I finally found it.

270
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I did the usual blow drying thing, opened it up.

271
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You know, all that's good stuff that you can't do with an iPhone.

272
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Take the battery out.

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Take the battery out.

274
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm the radiator in the morning and I work like a charm.

275
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So I just wanted to share this wonderful experience and, uh, Nokia.

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's it.

277
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay.

278
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Have a nice day.

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Bye.

280
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't know.

281
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Wait, yo.

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yo.

283
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Well, I feel really bad, but I'm, of course, extremely happy that it came back to life.

284
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Uh, your connection didn't sound all about hot though.

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Were you called?

286
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Were you actually calling on the E61?

287
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Because it sounded a little bit muddled.

288
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It sounded like there was some bubbles still left in there.

289
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, man, that's such a horrible feeling when that happens.

290
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, that sucks so bad.

291
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But it is true.

292
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You know, you, you open that sucker up.

293
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You rip the battery out.

294
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You start drying it.

295
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It'll just come back to life like magic.

296
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I really do love it.

297
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They candy man, dude.

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You should be hookin' my sister up.

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Listen, that commercial.

300
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, hey, hey.

301
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
By the way, she did not end with the obligatory.

302
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I love you.

303
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, that's a little bit disappointing.

304
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hey, Adam.

305
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This is Zach from Vegas and fuck you, Adam Curry.com.

306
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm listening to episode 695 right now.

307
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And there's a guy Eric from Portland who sent in a message saying that he was tired of everybody

308
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
saying fuck you, Adam Curry at the end of their message.

309
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And that he wants everybody to say, I love you, Adam Curry.

310
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And you agreed?

311
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Well, I got to tell you something.

312
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah.

313
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I agree with him too.

314
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm getting tired of saying fuck you, Adam.

315
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I didn't like it to begin with.

316
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It, that maybe that's why I was angry.

317
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Because everybody kept saying fuck you.

318
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And I knew deep down inside that I really did love you, Adam.

319
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're the first man crushed I've ever had.

320
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I just, I don't know what I would do without you.

321
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, baby.

322
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And all those times that you've been driven out of me that I missed the daily source code.

323
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'd take it out on everybody else.

324
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, no.

325
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Small animals.

326
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
For everyone.

327
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
My parents, my girlfriend.

328
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Everybody and anything I could possibly think of.

329
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So Adam, I didn't mean to hurt you.

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's okay, man.

331
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I really do love you, Adam.

332
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I know, I love you.

333
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I really do.

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, my God.

335
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay.

336
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm in my car.

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Calm down.

338
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, I'm down.

339
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay.

340
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I got to get us together.

341
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah.

342
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Okay.

343
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
All right.

344
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm getting rid of fuck you, Adam, peri.com.

345
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh.

346
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And I'm going to start the, I love you, Adam, peri.

347
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Good.

348
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I really love you, Adam.

349
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
All right.

350
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay.

351
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, God.

352
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I can't see.

353
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay.

354
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
All right, Adam.

355
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I love you.

356
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I love you so much.

357
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If you ever get divorced from Patricia, I will,

358
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I will, I'll move to England.

359
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You'll be my best.

360
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll marry you.

361
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We'll have lots of gay happiness.

362
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Love you.

363
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Okay.

364
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I love you, Adam.

365
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I love you, too.

366
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Bye.

367
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Bye.

368
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Hey, very good job.

369
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The Academy Award winner.

370
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
No doubt about it.

371
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I gotta tell you.

372
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I feel a lot better now that we've changed it all around.

373
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And you guys seem to be having fun with it.

374
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And it really has changed the comments once again.

375
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You know, I do this just to see the results and, you know,

376
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Vulcan mind trickery.

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And it's amazing.

378
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Uh, once I think we've now taken the quality of the comments,

379
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
yet up one more level.

380
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You can just hit the, the old Gmail box here.

381
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Let me see it.

382
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We've got, uh,

383
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This was a nice one.

384
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Uh, from Susie Tyler.

385
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Carmen Tyler's mom.

386
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And she has some suggestions on how I can stay in sync with two different

387
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
time zones by setting two different clocks.

388
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah, I don't really have a problem with that.

389
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's other people who have a problem with keeping track of my time zone.

390
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Maybe I should have, uh,

391
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and maybe I should, that should be my status message on my I am, you know,

392
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I am in the San Francisco time zone.

393
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Maybe some of you are,

394
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I've been in the San Francisco time zone.

395
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And, um,

396
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And uh, Susie ends up here.

397
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You don't have to end up having your TV on,

398
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

399
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
uh, uh, don't you just love having someone trying to mother you,

400
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
is what she says to me.

401
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It could be worse.

402
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I could be mother and lawing you.

403
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Hmm.

404
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't think that's worse.

405
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
As you know, that would mean I would be tasting the sweet nectar of your

406
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
lovely daughter.

407
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Uh, uh, take that visual.

408
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:48,400
visual. Um, let me see. Man, what did you guys send me? Is anything good? I'm sorry for

409
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,840
I, you know, I do this and then I realize that I'm actually not saying anything. Oh,

410
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,040
here's something about I've been looking for Iranians to get on the show. This is a good one.

411
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,240
Billy Waters. Adam, uh, I know some Iranians who fled Iran and now live in my country.

412
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,600
Iranians are gregarious, jolly, normal, noisy, pushy, nosy, just like everyone else everywhere

413
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,200
in the world. I was knocked flat by their openness and they have, uh, and they have some lunatics,

414
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,640
though, who mix religion with politics running the country. If you want, I can get you the number of

415
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,960
one who I'm sure would be willing to talk to you. I also know a guy who recently cycled the

416
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:29,520
bike from Ireland to China through Iran and it's only worry was being fed to death. He might be

417
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,280
wanting to talk to. Let me know if you want to hook up. Yeah, um, can you get me a female Iranian,

418
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:44,640
please? About a 5.10. Yeah, man, absolutely. Uh, I'd love to. That's what I asked for. I'd love

419
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,800
to speak to someone who's from, I'd love to speak to actually someone who's in Iran. They can make

420
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,960
phone calls, can't they? I mean, they've got, they have GSM technology. Can they call, can they call

421
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,520
the United States? Or can they call certainly they can call the United Kingdom? I mean,

422
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,120
I can't imagine that that country is completely isolated. I know they have internet. I know

423
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:10,160
they have bloggers. I know this. Gosh, so it's this one girl I met in Khan and, and I've forgotten

424
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:18,480
her name. I can't, um, I gotta find out who she was. She was the personal secretary of some

425
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,560
advertising agency Bigwig and she was from Iran and we were talking for like an hour and, uh,

426
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,880
she was telling me all this stuff about how young people are, you know, how metropolitan it is and

427
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,920
how they, how they, how they're into, I mean, she gave me some, uh, some blogs to, uh, I, I, I have

428
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,040
the piece of paper with a blog to look at or I had it. I don't have it anymore. I don't, I don't

429
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,680
remember her name. Uh, it's driving me crazy, but I know she could make a hook up. Shit, she would have been

430
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:51,680
great. Let's just try and find that. Hey, this is, uh, you know, going on to the, uh, the

431
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,200
Eisenhower quote that got a lot of response, uh, from the other day about the military industrial

432
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,520
complex, uh, Dave from New York said that you should check this quote out. I looked for an audio

433
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,320
version of it. Couldn't find it. I probably looked about 15, 20 minutes. So, and there was nothing,

434
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,240
uh, no video either, but I'll just read it to you. This is from 1954, uh, President Dwight D. Eisenhower

435
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,680
should any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment, uh, unemployment

436
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,120
insurance, shit. Let me start again because I want to sound presidential. Should any political

437
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,560
party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm

438
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,640
programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny

439
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,480
splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things. Among them are a few Texas oil

440
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:52,160
millionaires and an occasional politician or businessman from other areas. Their number is negligible

441
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,880
and they are stupid. How about their apples? This guy Dwight, you know, there must be a book about

442
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,520
Dwight Eisenhower. I don't think I've ever read a book about him. I know apparently extremely

443
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,960
little about the man, but I'm in very impressed. He's like the Nostradamus of America. And he's

444
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,920
been predicting shit that is coming true in my lifetime. We cannot remain ignorant to this.

445
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:28,640
We cannot. I asked for a little more in depth explanation of Ron Paul stance on property rights

446
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,560
that has a few people, not quite up in arms, but disappointed or confused. And we've got a response.

447
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:40,560
Adam, Andy here from Portland, we're going to respond to your question about the proper

448
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,960
rights issue. If you guys are on ball, there's campaign and saying he's a strict whatever

449
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,040
interpretation. Constitution. Constitution of the Constitution. And the problem I have with it is simply

450
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,480
that it's an over-stimplification. If that can be possible. I know that the Constitution is

451
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,360
mainly focused on property rights. Yeah, I think that Dwight Eisenhower also said, keep it simple

452
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,120
stupid. That was him, wasn't it? I know that the Constitution is mainly focused on property rights.

453
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:18,560
It's a very short document. It's very short. Yes. And I think that easy to remember.

454
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,280
Society, we have going on here. There's a bit more context than that. And I feel like the

455
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,080
government, the federal government and the state government's roles in our lives is to support us

456
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,680
and protect us. Do protect us? To look out for us, to support us is not quite the right

457
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,920
phraseology. And help us out. We pay them. They should do what we want. And anyway,

458
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:51,280
it's a more complicated issue. I think they're just a strict property rights interpretation to

459
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,160
me have there. And that's about to get. Thanks for including me in your conversation.

460
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,200
I really enjoy your show. So, all right. Okay. So, that actually didn't tell me anything.

461
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,800
I don't understand the issue. I maybe I got the wrong, maybe I got the wrong comment. Am I just an

462
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,240
idiot? Oh, I'm on a second. Well, please don't answer that. Okay.

463
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,320
No, crap. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what's gone wrong. I heard a couple other people

464
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:28,240
try and call in and explain it. I think it has to do with the government taking your land.

465
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,400
You have to understand at this point in time, you do not own the land that your house stands on.

466
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,840
No where except, hmmm. Was I going to say Texas again? I think it's Texas.

467
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,720
I'll have to go back and look at the constitution lessons that I posted on curie.com. I don't know

468
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,880
a couple months ago. You'll learn all about it there. Your car is not yours. It belongs to the

469
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,840
government. Okay. You do not hold the title to your car. You have a certificate of title.

470
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,200
You do not own the land that your house stands on. The government owns it. That's why they tax

471
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:11,520
you on it for using it. That in itself is unconstitutional. Anya.

472
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,440
This is a beautiful comment that came in. Hey Adam, touch here. Just got done listening to DSE

473
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:27,360
six nine six and just a few comments with the pizza hut and Burger King being on the military

474
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,280
Yeah, so this is part of my my thoughts about the military industrial complex and how

475
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,640
our tax dollars for the war against terror are being fed into mainly corporate America.

476
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,080
And that's where all this money is going. It's not just to put our boys and girls into the

477
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:54,880
sand to throw hot lead back and forth with an unknown enemy. Now it's to pump up revenues of these

478
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,240
companies by giving them business. And so yeah, Burger King Pizza Hut right there in Bosnia and Iraq

479
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,040
feeding our troops. I was in the army for 12 years and okay first of all. Thank you for your service.

480
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,920
And I don't mean that like those bullshit politicians when they say it on sea span. I really

481
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:20,000
fucking mean it. A lot of the fuel for you know you've been in the field two weeks and Burger King

482
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,840
and Pizza Hut. That's a fucking taste at home. Okay, yeah, you know, but if it was a look, if it was

483
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:38,480
apple pie, dude, that's shit'll kill you. That's more dangerous than terror itself. So I understand.

484
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,720
I really do understand. But you know, sure, you know, there has to be a limit to this.

485
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,840
Maybe only one or the other. It doesn't have to be both, you know. That's that's my point.

486
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:58,800
War is ugly. And a war zone is ugly. And it just goes beyond the imagination as to what's

487
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,720
being put into this war. You know, so much money is being spent on so many things.

488
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Ah, it's too late in the week for me to get into this. All right, I'm sorry. Oh, food.

489
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:18,560
And well, oh, yeah, there's a song I think you should play on the DSC by a band called Valorant,

490
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:25,200
or Valorant, whichever way you pronounce it. It's spelled V-A-L-E-R-I-A-M and it's children of the

491
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,000
menicide deals with what you're talking about about corporations taking over our world, our mind,

492
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,600
everything. And just a suggestion on the Ron Paul thing. Every site I go to, whether if you see

493
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:49,600
N-N-N-N-B-C-A-B-C-Fox, Google, Yahoo, I search for Ron Paul. Now, just think if you had all 100,000 people

494
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,360
always searching for that, it would go to the top of the search end, maybe get a little publicity.

495
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,840
Anyway, that's just my two cents. And, uh, oh yeah, fuck, no, of, whatever. Yeah.

496
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,600
All right, man. Thanks for the search engine optimization tip. That helps.

497
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,760
Sounds pretty good. I haven't actually listened to it, but I'll just take your recommendation

498
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,160
because you have done your service, my friend. Valorant, I guess. Children of the men's side.

499
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:17,600
The fun stuff, generation. We fertilized up the junk food and farming pollution.

500
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,600
The sealer's green, he's as red as a lot. All right, look at the game. Yeah.

501
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:33,600
The magazine's up all the trees we've never read. We cry in the night of our minds.

502
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:41,600
We're all the children of our lives. We give all the thrill. We're all the children of the night.

503
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:49,600
We respect them down on courage, limousines. We can't escape our fate.

504
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,600
We are the children of the men's side.

505
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,600
We're the children of the men's side.

506
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,600
We're the children of the men's side.

507
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,600
We're the children of the men's side.

508
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,600
We're the children of the men's side.

509
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,600
We're the children of the men's side.

510
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
We're the children of the men's side.

511
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
We're the children of the men's side.

512
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
We're the children of the men's side.

513
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
We're the children of the men's side.

514
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
We're the children of the men's side.

515
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
We're the children of the men's side.

516
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
We're the children of the men's side.

517
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
We're the children of the men's side.

518
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
We're the children of the men's side.

519
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
We're the children of the men's side.

520
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,600
We're the children of the men's side.

521
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,600
We're the children of the men's side.

522
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
We're the children of the men's side.

523
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
We're the children of the men's side.

524
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
We're the children of the women's side.

525
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
We're the children of the men's side.

526
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:07,600
We're the children of the men's side.

527
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
We're the children of the men's side.

528
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,600
We're the children of the men's side.

529
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
We're the children of the men's side.

530
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,600
We're the children of the men's side.

531
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:29,260
Yeah, okay, so let's not say we don't learn anything here on the Chuck.

532
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:35,480
Menticide, the undermining or destruction of a person's mind or will, especially by systematic

533
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:42,040
means, such as mental and physical torture, extensive interrogation, suggestion, training

534
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,400
and narcotics or brainwashing.

535
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Menticide.

536
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,840
I like it.

537
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,600
By the way, that sounds like an episode of the Daily Source Code, doesn't it?

538
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Menticide.

539
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Good word.

540
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
I'm going to be using that one a lot.

541
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,800
Welcome to the Menticide.

542
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,400
Welcome to the Menticide.

543
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Hmm.

544
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Yeah, sounds good.

545
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Nice.

546
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,680
Let me see another beautiful email.

547
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,360
Peter Grace, Adam, your show's six nine or five was one of the finest shows I've heard

548
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
you do.

549
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,960
Man, thank you so much.

550
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,920
I gotta tell you, when someone says that to me, that means a lot.

551
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,320
A comment, though, on boycotting or striking out against the military industrial complex,

552
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,520
probably more accurately called the military industrial financial managed healthcare complex.

553
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,480
Welcome to the Menticide.

554
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,760
Most of us are wage slaves.

555
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,120
I have a family, two mortgages, no hope for my future, but hope for my kids.

556
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,320
I'll encourage my kids to make a difference, but becoming homeless doesn't work towards

557
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
that.

558
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,000
I hope to make a difference by investing and voting.

559
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,320
I'm voting Ron Paul and I encourage others to do it, too.

560
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,400
I've put a lawn sign for Ron Paul on my lawn in addition to donating to his campaign.

561
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,200
Be well.

562
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,080
Peter, first of all, thank you again for the kind words.

563
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,320
Second of all, here's my philosophy.

564
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,760
You're never in trouble if you're out of money.

565
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,200
You're only in trouble if you're out of ideas, because this is the country of ideas.

566
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:24,520
I understand, I understand, you know, your situation is fucked up, food barred for sure.

567
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,200
But I do have some ideas.

568
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,240
In fact, I have a really, really good idea how we can get ourselves, how we can break

569
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,640
free from the Menticide.

570
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,120
Oh God, I love this word.

571
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,520
I'll only play this one other comment, which plays right into this, and then I'll give

572
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,760
you my idea, which came to me late this afternoon at the office, while I was a perusing

573
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,160
a suggestion to look at something on the web.

574
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Listen to this first.

575
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,160
Adam Gary, Chris Keller, I'm a town band of Ania.

576
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,200
I have a little story for you, so it'll metaphor or whatever you want to call it.

577
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
There's a bank robbery.

578
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,560
The robber said, all right, everybody put their hands up.

579
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,320
One of the host you said, let's bum muslim, he can't get us all.

580
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:13,160
You're the one to why no one does anything, or there's a reason no one does anything.

581
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,800
So, right, he can't get you all, he's got limited bullets, he's got limited time,

582
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,280
he's got limited motion.

583
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:25,080
But he's going to shoot, so he's going to get some of you.

584
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:30,480
And there's no way to tell who it is, he's going to get, so no one moves, because no one

585
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,280
wants to be one of the ones that get it.

586
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,160
That's why you're a suggestion of striking just can't work.

587
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,160
It's not going to work.

588
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,360
I mean, you're relatively self-sufficient, you've probably gotten up money and savings

589
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,440
to survive, even with a meagre visits to the rest of your life without work.

590
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,920
Most of us don't.

591
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,280
Most of us are a one or two months away from total poverty, from total, you know, bankruptcy

592
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,320
and debt and not being able to pay our bills.

593
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
We can't just strike.

594
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,440
That means losing our income, losing our income means losing our lives like that.

595
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,440
So, how do you do it?

596
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:08,640
Well, the only way to do it, the only way to make it work is if everybody does it simultaneously

597
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,440
all once, all together.

598
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,480
If you need to do that, no matter what everybody, I mean, the whole country, I mean,

599
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,760
another country to demand a decision.

600
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,480
I think even 10% of the United States population will be enough to have dramatic effects

601
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
on Washington.

602
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,480
I mean, if 30 million people stood up and said, no, what are they going to do?

603
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Ignore them?

604
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,120
If 30 million people, you don't ignore 30 million people.

605
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,240
But how do you organize?

606
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,360
How do you motivate and how you orchestrate the actions of 30 million people?

607
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
That's the problem.

608
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,520
That's where they have us by the balls.

609
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,360
Because the power of dollars, even if it took away all of our freedoms, the power of

610
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,400
dollars, 255 million people versus how many military.

611
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,120
I mean, short of nookiness is nothing they can do to stop us.

612
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,560
But all they have to do is cause us to stop ourselves.

613
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,760
So think about that.

614
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,400
It's not about standing up and saying, no, it's about how to get enough people to stand

615
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,840
up and say, no, simultaneously, in the unison, that's the problem.

616
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,000
How do you organize that many people?

617
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,640
Just don't think about, fuck you, Adam Gary.

618
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:20,200
OK, I'll let you slide for that one.

619
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,880
OK, so I'm listening to this at the office.

620
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,480
And then the female comes in from a raw, uh,

621
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,920
crotatual thing.

622
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,120
Adam, love the show.

623
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,120
This short video is great.

624
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,320
I think we would end up generates an interest with your listeners, uh,

625
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,760
which he found by a Boeing Boeing, and I will put that link in the show notes.

626
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,960
But you're going to be able to remember this one because it's a website that you can find

627
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,800
at storyofstuff.com.

628
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,320
And it is literally, um, the story of stuff.

629
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,680
Well, I'm like, one of my jacks is host.

630
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,560
Come on, bitch.

631
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
OK.

632
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,400
So let me, uh, since, um, since this is audio, I'm going to,

633
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,960
I'm going to play a piece from this for you.

634
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,840
It's kind of, it's like a widescreen kind of format.

635
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,280
There's a woman who, of course, I forgot in her name.

636
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,440
And that actually is quite important.

637
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,040
But she's kind of a superimposed over, uh, one, two, three,

638
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,560
over five, five drawings in the background.

639
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,680
And so it's five chapters of the story of stuff.

640
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,760
And it's, uh, it's not really that short.

641
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,120
It's quite long, actually.

642
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,960
Uh, but the, the five stories, the five chapters are extraction, production,

643
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,200
distribution, consumption, and disposal.

644
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,840
And then, of course, she has an alternative way.

645
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,720
And this is really about how we're raping the earth,

646
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,000
to manufacture, shit, create toxins, the toxins,

647
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,720
go into all the products that we make, um,

648
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,040
the products are designed to, to not last long, or it's a throwaway

649
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
products. You know, we have a throwaway culture.

650
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,960
And then, of course, this stuff, uh, only a small percentage,

651
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,840
is actually recycled, you know, all of this, uh, you know,

652
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,120
we're killing the earth. That's what this is.

653
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,200
You want, you understand that when you see it,

654
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,240
you'll say, I understand the story, but you should actually sit through it and watch it,

655
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,320
because, um, it's a good story.

656
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,040
It's good to be reminded and, uh, particularly, um, when she talks about

657
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,720
government and big business.

658
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,280
And the cartoons are kind of funny and very illustrative.

659
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,560
I'm sure my daughter's going to watch.

660
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,720
I hope so. I'll, uh, if I recommend it to her, she'll never watch it.

661
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,040
I'll try and get her one of her friends to recommend it to her, um,

662
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,120
but there's a piece in the middle that, and it just, it like hit me,

663
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:34,560
like, whoa, I have the solution to how we can actually create a positive,

664
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,280
a positive show of force to demonstrate against the, let's just call the

665
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,240
industrial complex, because it's not just military, big part of it, by the way.

666
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,200
But we can actually, we have, we've had the control that our fingertips for years,

667
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,720
and we haven't even understood that we have the power.

668
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,320
And to enforce this power, actually, enriches our lives,

669
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,960
literally, and riches our lives.

670
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,640
If you take it in one literal sense, there's a couple of them.

671
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,040
So I just want to play this one part called consumption.

672
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,760
And I think you can drop into the middle of the story.

673
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,840
So right now, you see, there's this, uh, we've gone from, uh,

674
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,200
extraction of raw materials from the earth, of course, in their world countries.

675
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,720
Into production, we create toxins, we blow toxins into the air, everyone's toxic, we're all going to die.

676
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,760
Then it goes over to distribution, you know, Walmart, Apple, Microsoft, uh, yeah,

677
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,760
hardware, um,

678
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:50,880
came out, no, Walmart, um, you know, the Sears, uh, radio shack, whatever, big distribution, consumer goods.

679
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,920
Thank you.

680
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,000
Then it goes into trash, I take, you know, trash out, and then how we get rid of trash, and

681
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,640
and how basically, you know, we're sucking the earth dry, okay.

682
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,440
But then there's this one little golden arrow, which is the consumption part.

683
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,080
Please pay attention to this. Just listen, sit back.

684
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,440
You'll, you'll hit the part that I really, I can't fast forward. This thing otherwise, it probably would have

685
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,840
cuted up. I know I'm getting to it. I know I would have cuted up a different

686
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:25,600
different spot, but it'll be worth a couple of minutes to listen to this chapter from storyofstuff.com.

687
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,880
That brings us to the golden arrow of consumption.

688
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,040
This is the heart of the system, the engine that drives it.

689
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,920
It is so important that protecting this arrow has become the top priority for both of these

690
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,360
guys. That's why after 9-11, when our country was in shock and President Bush could have suggested

691
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:50,480
any number of appropriate things to grieve, to pray, to hope. No, he said to shop, to shop.

692
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,600
We have become a nation of consumers. Our primary identity has become that of being consumers,

693
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:03,760
not mothers, teachers, farmers, but consumers. The primary way that our value is measured

694
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:10,080
and demonstrated is by how much we contribute to this arrow, how much we consume, and do we,

695
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:17,760
we shop, and shop, and shop, keep the materials flowing, and flow they do. Guess what percentage

696
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,880
of total materials flow through this system is still in product or use six months after

697
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:34,240
their date of sale in North America. 50 percent? 20? No. 1 percent. 1. In other words, 99 percent

698
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,640
of the stuff we harvest mine, processed transport, 99 percent of the stuff we run through this

699
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,760
system is trashed within six months. Now, how can we run a planet with that level of materials

700
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,680
throughput? It wasn't always like this. The average US person now consumes twice as much as they

701
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,440
did 50 years ago. Ask your grandma. In her day stewardship and resourcefulness and thrift were

702
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,800
valued. So how did this happen? Well, it didn't just happen. It was designed. Shortly after World

703
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,040
War II, these guys were figuring out how to ramp up the economy, retailing analyst Victor Lebow

704
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,000
articulated the solution that's become the norm for the whole system. He said, are enormously

705
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,640
productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying

706
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,680
and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction in

707
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:32,000
consumption, many of things consumed, burned up, replaced and discarded at an ever accelerating rate.

708
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,680
President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors Chairman said that the American economy's

709
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,680
ultimate purpose is to produce more consumer goods. More consumer goods are ultimate purpose,

710
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,600
not provide health care, education, or safe transportation, or sustainability, or justice,

711
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:55,440
consumer goods. How did they get us to jump on board this program so enthusiastically? Well,

712
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,320
two of their most effective strategies are planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence.

713
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,000
Planed obsolescence is another word for designed for the dumb. It means they actually make

714
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,720
stuff to be useless as quickly as possible, so we'll chuck it and buy a new one. It's obvious

715
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,160
with things like plastic bags and coffee cups, but now it's even big stuff. Mob, DVDs, cameras,

716
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,520
barbecues, even everything, even computers. Have you noticed that when you buy a computer now,

717
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,520
the technology is changing so fast that in just a couple of years, it's actually an impediment

718
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,480
to communication? I was curious about this, so I opened up a big desktop computer to see what was

719
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,840
inside. And I found out that the piece that changes each year is just a tiny little piece in the

720
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,640
corner, but you can't just change it at one piece because each new version is a different shape,

721
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,480
so you've got to chuck the whole thing and buy a new one. So I was reading industrial design

722
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,000
journals from the 1950s when planned obsolescence was really catching on. These designers are so open

723
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,600
about it. They actually discuss how fast can they make stuff break that still leaves the consumer

724
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,800
having enough faith in the product to go out and buy another one. It was so intentional, but stuff

725
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,240
can not break fast enough to keep this arrow afloat. So there's also perceived obsolescence.

726
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:15,200
Now perceived obsolescence is to throw away stuff that is still perfectly useful. How do they do

727
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,800
that? Well, they change the way the stuff looks. So if you bought your stuff a couple of years ago,

728
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,960
everyone can tell that you haven't contributed to this arrow recently. And since the way we

729
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,920
demonstrate our value is contributing to this arrow, it can be embarrassing. Like I've had the

730
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,920
same fat white computer monitor on my desk for five years, my coworker just got a new computer.

731
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,840
She has a flat shiny sleek monitor. The matches are computer, matches are phone, even a

732
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,960
pen stand. She looks like she's driving in spaceship central and I kind of like going

733
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,720
about a washing machine on my desk. Fashion is another prime example of this. Have you ever wondered

734
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,520
why women shoot heels go from fat one year to skin is the next to fat to skinny? It's not because

735
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,680
there's some debate about which heel structure is the most healthy for women's feet. It's because

736
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,320
wearing fat heels in a skinny heel year shows everybody that you haven't contributed to that

737
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,880
arrow as recently. So you're not as valuable as that person in skinny heels next to you or more

738
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:18,240
likely in some ad. It's to keep us buying new shoes. Advertisements and media in general plays a big

739
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,640
role in this. Each of us in the US is targeted with over 3,000 advertisements a day. We see more

740
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,440
advertisements in one year than people 50 years ago saw in a lifetime. And if you think about it,

741
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,720
what's the point of an ad except to make us unhappy with what we have? So 3,000 times today,

742
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,280
we're told our hair is wrong. Our skin is wrong. Our clothes are wrong. Our furniture is

743
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,200
wrong. Our car is wrong. We are wrong, but it can all be made right if we just go shopping. Media also

744
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,400
helps by hiding all of this and all of this. So the only part of the material's economy we see

745
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,240
is the shopping. The extraction, production and disposal all happens outside of our field of vision.

746
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:00,720
So in the US, we have more stuff than ever before, but polisho that our national happiness is

747
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,800
actually declining. Our national happiness peaked in the 1950s. The same time that this consumption

748
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:14,640
maniac exploded. Interesting coincidence. I think I know why. We have more stuff but we have less

749
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,640
time for the things that really make us happy. Friends, family, leisure time. We're working harder

750
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,840
than ever. Some analysts say we have less leisure time than any time since feudal society.

751
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,760
And do you know what the two main activities are that we do with the scant leisure time we have?

752
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:36,480
Watch TV and shop. In the US, we spend three to four times as many hours shopping as our

753
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,800
counterparts in Europe do. So we're in this ridiculous situation where we go to work maybe

754
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,280
two jobs even when we come home and we're exhausted. So we plopped in on our new couch and watch TV.

755
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,360
And the commercials tell us you suck. So we got to go to them all the bisoning to feel better.

756
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,080
And then you got to go to work more to pay for the stuff you just bought. You come home and

757
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,040
you're more tired. You sit down and you watch more TV. And it tells you go to them all again.

758
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:02,240
And we're on this crazy work, watch, spend treadmill. And we could just stop now you see that's the

759
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,320
paint that's the piece. We spent all this stuff. Shut up. Thank you. That's the piece I really

760
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:15,200
want to get to hear. Wow. What an eye opener perceived obsolescence. That is indeed a fantastic

761
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:21,840
model. It's never been mine, but it's the business model of fashion. As an example,

762
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:28,640
it's the business model of cars of consumer goods without a doubt perceived obsolescence. Fantastic.

763
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:36,640
So the easiest way is to slow down the consumer spending. I don't know. We don't have to stop it.

764
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,920
But the good news is when you slow down consumer spending when you and I start spending less.

765
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,920
We actually have more money. What a concept. What a great protest this could be. Stop the

766
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:59,120
menicide. Stop shopping. Now obviously double edged sword here because I'm a part of this machine

767
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:05,280
or we're starting up or we're kind of in the mid cycle of a of a new version of this.

768
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:13,680
And you know, I'm a commercial MF. I got no problem with making money with advertising.

769
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:23,440
But perhaps we can look at what we're buying first and foremost. Reusables, green, etc, etc.

770
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:31,520
But really just slow it down. Particularly this perceived obsolescence. I think that's a big deal.

771
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:38,880
I really do. I, you know, when when someone is trying to sell you something, maybe this is

772
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,960
the best plan of attack when someone is trying to sell you something because last year's model is

773
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,440
uncool. And that's the product you should not be buying. Then you're buying into the whole

774
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,920
work really hard. Have TV tell you you suck because you don't have the latest and the greatest.

775
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,080
Go shopping, go work harder to go make some money for that is a deadly deadly circle of

776
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:07,760
cycle that we're in. I can see I can see my own daughter in this cycle easily easily.

777
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,360
And even though she gets minimal input from television because she really doesn't watch that much TV.

778
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,080
Well, I'm sure banner ads and shit, you know, magazine, whatever fashion fashion is doing it.

779
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,240
Maybe we should start a new fashion line. I have the wrong bag. Just put it just a bag, a hand bag that says

780
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,400
wrong bag. You know how women will look at it. She's got the wrong bag.

781
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,760
Can you believe it? She's got the wrong bag. Look at those heels. Wrong heels. Just make it like the red products,

782
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:41,440
you know? Instead of saying red or instead of saying Gucci, just wrong. That's even better.

783
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:47,520
That's, uh, I've got a new brand, the wrong brand. I've got the wrong bag. I've got the wrong car.

784
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,520
I've got the wrong shirt. Excellent. Hey, Chris Mac, let's start making those up. Let's

785
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,520
start making up some t-shirts trademark. I'm calling it right now. We're going for the wrong brand.

786
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:07,200
What a great idea. Stop the menicide by wrong. Stop the menicide. I say bye wrong.

787
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,240
Oh, I should wrap this up.

788
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,880
I'm good. Chris and River Town. I can to call you and leave comments in real time. I'll actually

789
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,400
pause your podcast and call up and leave a comment. What I just heard,

790
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,560
course, that was about 30 seconds before we change from buck you haven't carried. I love you haven't

791
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,960
carried. So I got another one for eight updates. I fucking love you. I'm carry.

792
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,080
That's a great one. All right, uh, one more song, uh, not pod safe, but uh,

793
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,680
very appropriate for the time of year. Happy Hanukkah, everybody.

794
00:48:50,400 --> 00:49:09,200
Good old young Haka, it's time for Hanukkah. So much fun, Haka, to celebrate Hanukkah.

795
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,200
Oh, my God.

796
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:19,840
Hanukkah is the best of all of us.

797
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,720
Instead of one day have a presence. We get eight.

798
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,440
Where do you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree?

799
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,160
Here's our new list of people who are Jewish.

800
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,440
Swallow slide you and play.

801
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,040
When no narrator drinks to manage heaven's wine.

802
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,120
Then spins the drain home with a raffle and a kelvin climb.

803
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:09,680
Get your shoes and receives loads of Hanukkah toys.

804
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,360
The girls from Baruchasov and all three Beastie boys.

805
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,400
Letting grab it is have Jewish.

806
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:28,160
Court in love is have to. Put them together. What a fucking badass show.

807
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,120
We got Harvey Kaitel and flashed answer to the bill.

808
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,120
It has been played from Baywatch's Jewish and yes, her boobs are real.

809
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:55,520
So let our nanny Haka, a shot of Hanukkah, two time Oscar winner dusting Hanukkah,

810
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,400
shall ever let's run a gun.

811
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,680
Still not a Jew.

812
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,320
The guess who is the guy who does the voice for Scooby-Doo.

813
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,200
Rob Dylan was born a Jew. Then he wasn't but now he's back.

814
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,880
Mary Tyler Moore's husband is Jewish.

815
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,880
Costware pretty good in the sack.

816
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:30,000
Yes, you got barbets fitted on the PGA tour.

817
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,840
No, I'm not talking about Tiger Woods. I'm talking about Mr. Happy Hillmore.

818
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:46,320
So many Jews are in the show.

819
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:52,800
It's not roasting. It isn't Jewish, but my mother thinks he is.

820
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:59,840
Still there will be a monocone. It's half the sale of freedom Haka.

821
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:06,080
It's not your house, Jannaka. But she is sighted in Hanukkah.

822
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:12,000
So reach our home, don't fight Haka. Get drunk and deal with Haka.

823
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:30,080
That's a new updated version of the Hanukkah song. I don't know how old it is.

824
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:36,160
I was familiar with the first one. It's like a new list of Jews, fantastic. Happy Hanukkah,

825
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,920
the Hanukkah song. Nice to hear some actual vinyl crackling there.

826
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,360
Haven't heard that in a long time.

827
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:46,960
Okay, so I think we've got a whole new fashion statement. We've got a whole new A to protest.

828
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,880
We could roll this out globally. Stop the men aside.

829
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:58,000
By wrong. I just love it. I can see you the wrong brand everywhere.

830
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:05,760
And good old products made in the USA, by the way. And recyclable reusable products. By wrong.

831
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,640
I don't know if I'm going to be able to do a food bar Friday for you tomorrow because I'm

832
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,200
actually on the plain home. Thank goodness Friday afternoon. We've got early morning Friday

833
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,720
meetings. I won't be back in the condo until late Thursday night when I'd normally do the show.

834
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,920
I got a pack because I got to take my bag with me to the meeting. So I just don't know if I'm

835
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,200
going to have time because you know, a food bar takes a little prep with songs and all that stuff.

836
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,600
So I'll make it up to you if I don't just remember. Man, there's so many things to

837
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,000
remember. You've got to live your life with passion. You've got to enjoy your freedom.

838
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,240
And we've got to stop the men aside. Vote for Ron Paul and shop wrong.

839
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,480
Another pod show podcast. Stick it in your ear.

840
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,560
Make a statement with Saudi stereo ear buds.

841
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:07,520
Sleek metal housings that reduce vibration delivering killer sound from a tiny package.

842
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,720
Buy yours at Sony.com slash headphones. Sony earbuds with style meets sound.
