00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, Gruscott, and herzlich will come in.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Tannig Bulgar, I'm in Germany, and you hear the daily source code,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oscar V. 500, 47.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
With Adam Curry.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I need little pants.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
From Pod Show, home of the world's most dangerous new content comes the Daily Source Code.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
With Adam Curry.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
About $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We don't need no sticking greens in.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm just in case I'm curry.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Thank God, it's...

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
One ticket please.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But Adam and Lucy are invited here.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And what's going on man?

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
She's at home.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes, she's at home.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes, she's at home.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's the new liquid.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I just want to bear it for night away.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, right here I am now.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm going to stay.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, my God.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We got the new liquid.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Down until I feel the slavery has passed.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Basically, I give the names, it's wrong.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm out here in Heaven.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And still, I can't erase the flame I feel

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The 10-letter of we use to share

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Save like a floor, throw it at

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I've got fire, was giving me a side

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's music play

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I've just walked in there for night away

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, right here, right here

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, I'm gonna stay

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
All I know

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, yeah

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's a really play-all

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's a fear I feel that's never reached out

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm over the kitchen dude

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Keep the nils in stone

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
All let it play-all

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let it play-all

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And let it play-all

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And let it all play-all

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And let it all play-all

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We can go to the other

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ha ha ha ha

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If I can make it through the night

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
All I know

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll just pitch it

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Here with me

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
All I know

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's a place I'll see

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I know it's basically

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But as I hold it up for me

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's a music play

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I've just walked in there for night away

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah, right here, right here

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Well, I'm gonna stay

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
All I know

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, yeah

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
All I know

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And let it play-all

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Doesn't tell us the others never is

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Go, go, go, go

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Ha ha

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If I can make it through the night

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's football, man

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's what it's all about

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Barry White

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let the music play

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Play-all

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
All the way to start a Friday

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Daily source code episode 5-47

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
How you doing everybody

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It is Friday

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The Master of the Manor

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Adam Curry

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Coming to you from Curry

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Manor

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And the affluent suburb of Surrey

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Known as Gulford

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
On the west side of G-town

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why am I playing Barry White?

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Well, let me tell you

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Last night, the lady Patricia and I watched

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The documentary on sky

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Like six or something like that

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And it was about the life and times of Barry White

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Post you mostly put together

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Because of course this legend has been

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Has been gone for a number of years

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And it was titled Let The Music Play

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And it was such a fascinating story

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
To hear how Barry White came from

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Literally walked

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
From East Los Angeles to Hollywood

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And started out as a drummer

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And then an A&R guy and a producer

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And then started making records

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And just what a talent this guy was

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And throughout this entire documentary

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
People are all talking about

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How Barry's music will live on

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And there's his ex-wife

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And there's his daughter

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And there's his writing partner

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And Barry's music will live on

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And I'm thinking

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, shit, how's it going to live on

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If people live over here

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There's stuff

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How are you going to discover it?

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You typed in white

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
On iTunes

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And all of a sudden it showed up

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Which of course is how I got that track

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because I did buy it

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And only a fraction of his

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Catalog is available

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Online

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And you know, you can have to

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Really search hard to find

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
His Catalog in music stores

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
For whatever music stores

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I still left over

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So you know, if you liked what you heard

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And you want to learn all about

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The love making skills of Mr. Barry White

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And how they can affect you

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And how you

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But you know what the word

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The word is legs

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Go home, spread the word

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Make babies with Barry White

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I just got to play that stuff

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I just couldn't stop

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Last night

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Patricia and I went straight up

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
To the attic

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And started playing

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Like 20 Barry White tracks

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Which is pretty much everything

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's there

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Then of course there's some love

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And limited stuff

150
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I just like, oh man

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I got to share that with my friend

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So it is Fubar Friday

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Please don't sue me

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That was out of the goodness of my heart

155
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Ah

156
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How to great day yesterday in London

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Sorry that wasn't able to put out a show

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I kind of knew it wasn't going to happen

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Just because you know, I had to be in really early

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's president

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Excuse me, you can still tell I got this

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ah

163
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Various

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
A lot of people in London

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hacking in coffin as well

166
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Um

167
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, so we had some meetings with the

168
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
With the BT folks

169
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
BT vision

170
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Which of course is there

171
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There's that top box

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Which is now available in limited quantities

173
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And about pod show TV

174
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And then had dinner

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
With two of the most powerful

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Women at British telecom

177
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Who control hundreds of millions of pounds

178
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So I was really all cleaned up

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And looking nice

180
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll go see that

181
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sucking up

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The best I could do

183
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Ah

184
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No

185
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But it's great

186
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Because it's two completely different cultures

187
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
When you come together

188
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
As pod show and BT

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And it's really nice how we do fit together

190
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We go together

191
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Like shinglinglingling

192
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hey, I got a note here from Amy Mack

193
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Adam, I know you're feeling crappy

194
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And hoping to travel on Friday

195
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Actually, I was going to travel Friday

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But now it's going to be Sunday

197
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So I'm going to cut you some slack

198
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And give you this week

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Assurcize free

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Feel better

201
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Hope to see you next week

202
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Amy Mack

203
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I will see you next week

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And maybe you can do a personal

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Assurcize

207
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Speaking of body parts

208
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Did you see this or did you hear about this report

209
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The UNICEF put out

210
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That said the best place to raise kids

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
In the entire world is the Netherlands

212
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And they have some kind of

213
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They'll have a very detailed study

214
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And it's based upon a lot of things

215
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't really understand

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And they came up with some kind of index

217
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And by the way, I'd like to disagree

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It may be great to grow up in the Netherlands

219
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But it's very hard to break out of the Netherlands

220
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Once you grow up there

221
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Very few seem to

222
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay, so that doesn't matter

223
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll take that

224
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The worst country in the world

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
By far in a way

226
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Was the United States

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Which I also have my disagreements about

228
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The second to worst was the United Kingdom

229
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So I'm like, look in the survey

230
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And I said, we definitely need better data

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And I got it today

232
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
courtesy of the son

233
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This is the son online

234
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So I'll post a link to it in the show

235
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No, it's a daily source code.com

236
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
British women have the biggest breasts in Europe

237
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A survey revealed yesterday

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, yes

239
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I knew it was in the right country

240
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Here you go

241
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The poll which is done for Brahmaker triumph

242
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Also the manufacturer of fine motorcycles

243
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Found that only in this country

244
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Did more than half the women need a decouper larger

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Our 57%

246
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Including curvy model Kelly Brook

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Put the rest in the shade

248
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
With Denmark second

249
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
On 50%

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And then number three the Netherlands

251
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
36%

252
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Third biggest houters of Europe

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Belgium after that

254
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Notice I've lived in three of these countries

255
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
France, Sweden, Greece, Switzerland

256
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The Swedes in the Swiss

257
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Have the largest number of acup sizes

258
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
At 14%

259
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Fantastic fabulous

260
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Fabulous survey

261
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Very appreciative

262
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Because I was just getting a little bit worried about

263
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
About why we're actually here in the UK

264
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oops

265
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
On the second

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Pilot error

267
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hey Adam, it's dark from Sydney again

268
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So let me get this right

269
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You go to the toilet with your N800

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I just

271
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't know what you need to be doing with that

272
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
In the toilet

273
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah

274
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, you can't fathom that can you

275
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well let me tell you I like to sit in my friend

276
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I like to sit no matter what my business is

277
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
In the toilet

278
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I've completely retrained myself

279
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
42 years of horrible habit

280
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So that we can keep the bathroom splatter free

281
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Even though I don't have to clean it up

282
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I do have to clean up my own shit in San Francisco

283
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The condo

284
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yeah, of course I've got to

285
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
My interior engineer

286
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Christinaizer name coincidentally

287
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Who comes by before

288
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I show up in after I leave

289
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But still you know when I'm there for a week

290
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I have to clean crap up

291
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Not just crap

292
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah man

293
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's what that's what the N800 is

294
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Fantastic for again yesterday

295
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Went to London

296
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Took this

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
There's Nokia internet tablet with me

298
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Walked into the pod show

299
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Shortage crash pad

300
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And

301
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Immediately

302
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It found I'd taken it there before

303
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So it found the network

304
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It had already connected me

305
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Didn't have to do anything

306
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I was doing my email

307
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And I didn't have to log around a laptop

308
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So that's basically what you know you use the laptop for

309
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And I actually got some stuff

310
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I used it on the train with the

311
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
With the modem from my phone

312
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Um

313
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I've I haven't had a lot of time

314
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
In the past two days

315
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
To really mess around with all the

316
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm going to talk about that later in a free

317
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Trinity update

318
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
To mess around with all the

319
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The python scripts

320
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But it's a fantastic device

321
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm I'm actually

322
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Getting back into a little bit of programming

323
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Learning how to

324
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
To a now address the

325
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What is it the gtk?

326
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I guess that's graphical

327
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Toolkit or something like that

328
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
From python so you can open up windows

329
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And and file

330
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
File dialog boxes and

331
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Put some functionality into some scripts

332
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And once you really get into the zone of

333
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Scripting and something

334
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It really goes quite fast

335
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And you should see this development

336
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Environment

337
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I got to make a screenshot of that

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So that's all right

339
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Just a little geeky stuff for a second

340
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So I'm SSH

341
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
In

342
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
To the device

343
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
To the N800

344
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
From my laptop

345
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So I've got a

346
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
A terminal window open

347
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And then I have VNC running

348
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Next to it

349
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So if I program a window to pop open

350
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Through the python toolkit

351
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Graphical toolkit

352
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I can actually see that appear

353
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Without having to have the device

354
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Right next to me

355
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's really it's a lot of

356
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I got a delia

357
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I

358
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Love the tinfoil hat moments

359
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Hi I'm in CG here again

360
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm really pleased that you picked up my suggestion

361
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
For it's some things

362
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And you're getting some

363
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Now getting some ass exercise as well

364
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
In order to encourage more people to take up this

365
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I mean just for those of you just joining the show

366
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Just so you don't confuse about ass exercise

367
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And whatever he just said in German

368
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This is about the sits and

369
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
sits and pink on

370
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
In other words

371
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
A movement

372
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
A movement to have all men sit down

373
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
When they pee

374
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
As I can't say it any other way

375
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Sit down when you do a number one

376
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Because it'll you know

377
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It'll save a lot of hassle and nastiness

378
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
For the person who has to clean the toilet for you

379
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Practice

380
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I really think that they need to ask

381
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The person who does the cleaning

382
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And that is

383
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What benefit there is

384
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
After they've tried it a week

385
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If you like me

386
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And you're being down on your hands

387
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And these

388
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
With a scrubber

389
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And the bottle of bleach

390
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You really get to see what

391
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Spray about

392
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Just for now

393
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Thank you man

394
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Hey great news

395
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And I got this this tidbit

396
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
From tons of people

397
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Of course

398
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Quoting

399
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
From several sources

400
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Now that Google has more computing muscle

401
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Sarah J. Bryn

402
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So the company will start selling additional storage capacity

403
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
To email users with extraordinary needs

404
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Google still hasn't figured out

405
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The specifics would bring indicated the email storage

406
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And fees will be introduced later this year

407
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
To be similar to Google's photo hosting service

408
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The charge is $25 annually for 6.25 gigabytes

409
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And $500 annually for $250 gigabytes

410
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Hello

411
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah

412
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Love it

413
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh they finally heard me

414
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Fuck you Jason

415
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Not only have I been talking about this

416
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Since the inception of Gmail

417
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And as you know

418
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm already deep in the

419
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Conclaves

420
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000

The Catacombs of Google

423
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Because I got the

424
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Special 4 gigabyte limit

425
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Which of course I've surpassed for a year now

426
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And keep floating at 98.99%

427
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But look at our board of directors dude

428
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Maybe that'll give you a clue

429
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Is to who really

430
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Really insticated this

431
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000

This is Bizzoucajo and this week's edition

455
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Of Solopsistic Nation features an exquisite corpse mix

456
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It began with sending a song to a fellow podcaster

457
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And asking them to select the track that they thought

458
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Go after the tune I picked

459
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The next podcaster had to choose a song based

460
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
On the previous track with the tune they dug

461
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The process was completed until the mix was complete

462
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
How the mix unfolds will be just as much as a prize for us

463
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
As it will be for you

464
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000

That's a good idea

479
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I like that it's kind of like one of those

480
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Party games you play at the table at a dinner party

481
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000

485
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But the promo definitely

486
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Definitely did it for me

487
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Like this one too

488
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's just the riff of a new song

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm working on Adam

That's right by time you get this

499
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But time you play it

500
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
On a daily source code we're back

501
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000

David I like this groove

508
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Cool, you know what I just

509
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Truthfully I just kind of kick this thing around

510
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Some new funny songs

511
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So this is a new thing

512
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm just kind of kicking around right now

513
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So as soon as it has some likes

514
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
We'll send it your way

515
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And oh listen

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Let us know when you get to New York

517
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah, maybe we'll go to London

518
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Maybe we'll go to London

519
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Maybe we'll hang out with you guys in London

520
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Alright so listen Adam

521
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Keep up the great work in them

522
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And we'll see you around the pod as fair

523
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, yeah

524
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I David the lovely Lisa

525
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah, I know

526
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You're episode 202 already

527
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Because I think I got that one last night on the train

528
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Did I get on the train?

529
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It was the morning that I saw a show up

530
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
200 was great and congratulations

531
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And yes I'm going to be in New York

532
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm going to I have a

533
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh I'm appearing in a production

534
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't know if I can actually mention it yet

535
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So I won't say that

536
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But it's being done in North Carolina

537
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I think I think it's North Carolina

538
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And it's acting

539
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's a real stretch for me too

540
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's something that's kind of fun

541
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It has to do with pod show

542
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And you can't really get there from here

543
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So instead of flying for nine hours like Atlanta

544
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And then taking another plane

545
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And I was like why don't I just go to New York with Virgin

546
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Which I love you know

547
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I just love Virgin Atlantic

548
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I can't help it

549
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I would rather stay at night in New York

550
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Just to fly the first leg on Virgin Atlantic

551
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So I'm going to stay one night in New York

552
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Which I think is going to be Friday

553
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Or Saturday Saturday night

554
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The

555
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Ojipu

556
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm thinking the 10th or 11th or something like that

557
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And then I'm flying out Sunday

558
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And then I think that that week

559
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Anyway shit

560
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm coming to New York

561
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Okay, I got a lot of stuff to do

562
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But I would definitely love

563
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I would love to hang with you guys

564
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Maybe that night when I arrived before I go

565
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
To North Carolina the next day

566
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Maybe we go hang out

567
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll be a little jet lag a little bit tired

568
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But I would love to hang out with you

569
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And the lovely lady Lisa

570
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm feeling mighty lonesome

571
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Haven't slept a wink

572
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I walk the floor and watch the door

573
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And in between I drink

574
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Black coffee

575
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Love is a hand me down the road

576
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'll never know a Sunday

577
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
In this week they rule

578
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm talking to the shadows

579
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Wanna collect your phone

580
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And load house below the moment's go

581
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
When all I do is phone

582
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Black coffee

583
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Since the blues cut my eye

584
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm hanging out on Monday

585
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
My Sunday dreams

586
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
To dry

587
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Now man is born to go

588
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I love him

589
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
A woman's born to wait and for it

590
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
To stay at home

591
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And tender of him

592
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And down her pastry the rest

593
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
In coffee and cigarettes

594
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm moaning all morning

595
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Moaning all the night

596
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And in between it's nicotine

597
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And not much hard to fight

598
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Black coffee

599
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Feeling low as the ground

600
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Recognize that tuna

601
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
From a couple days ago

602
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's driving me crazy

603
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You're waiting for you baby

604
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
To come around

605
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Black coffee

606
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Fultures with splendor

607
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If you must know

608
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Stephanie Hardger

609
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Hardger

610
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I think it's Hardger

611
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Of course that was the soundtrack

612
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The chef Mark used

613
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And his valentines concoction

614
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And I sent me a note

615
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
That's great

616
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What a great track that is

617
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Thanks, Chef Mark

618
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
For letting me know that was on the podcast

619
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Music Network of course it was

620
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yesterday

621
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Second episode of Textra

622
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Launched Natalie Del Conti

623
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Who is now doing a multi day

624
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Technology show

625
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
For Pod Show

626
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm really liking it

627
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I think you should go check it out

628
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I had a

629
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Had a really good conversation with her

630
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Just before we started the series

631
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And

632
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I have to say

633
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
This young lady is a true, true, true feminist

634
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And every sense of the word

635
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
We were in discussions about her doing a show

636
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Now she's a very accomplished writer

637
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And she's written about technology

638
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
For a number of years

639
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
She has degrees

640
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And all kinds of really impressive stuff

641
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But she's also beautiful

642
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And no one can deny it

643
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And she said, I really want to do something different

644
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
With this show

645
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I really want to be girly and feminine

646
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And sexy and still talk about technology

647
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I don't want to have to hide my assets

648
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So to speak

649
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And I want to

650
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It should be possible

651
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It should be a combination of both

652
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I know she went on cranky geeks

653
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The other day I haven't seen the show

654
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So I don't know if she talked about that

655
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But I'm so proud of her

656
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
As a woman myself

657
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm just so proud of what she's doing

658
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And everyone who's watched the show

659
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
seems to just love it

660
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
So there's a new one up today

661
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Textra, T-E-X-T-R-A

662
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Textra.podshow.com

663
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
With Natalie Del Conti

664
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Mark Yoshimaru and M-Coff

665
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Not a pretty good idea actually

666
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Maybe it's something for the Fubar

667
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's something

668
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
If there's enough what do you call it

669
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
If there's enough people that want to try this out

670
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm totally game for it

671
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The idea is

672
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Bringing back the guitar solo

673
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Guitar solo

674
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's almost something of the past

675
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You know, almost something of the 80s

676
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yet you know that

677
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Oh crap

678
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Hey folks, listen to serious stars 102

679
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Go get your own guitar

680
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Get out your axe

681
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Because we'll be talking about it

682
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Download the whole show

683

684
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Before we find out the rest of this story

685
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I think that there's still lots of people

686
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
who love to just pick up the guitar and just riff

687
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And I think that there's, you know, we've had

688
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Air Guitar Contest

689
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But actually, I think that

690
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Audio podcast like this one

691
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Maybe a good place to bring back the guitar solo

692
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So if you've got a guitar solo

693
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Or if you want to record your guitar solo

694
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Send it to

695
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000

Mark and I are going to see if we can get something going

701
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Now he actually sent it

702
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
He claims this is his guitar solo

703
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
He says the guitar used for this

704
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Was a bright yellow custom-made

705
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Strat body with EMG pickups

706
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I have, if Mark, if, well,

707
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Listen to this

708
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
This is apparently a guitar solo

709
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000

Yadi Adi

714
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Where's my fucking latte?

715
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
All that stuff.

716
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Small penis, here we go

717
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
1-Sport

718
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Mark, if that's really you

719
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Stop podcasting

720
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We just fucking stop

721
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Go play guitar

722
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,240
I don't know if I, I'm looking, I think for guitar solo is that don't have rhythm

723
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,680
section behind it. Just, you know, just let me hear your sound, man. And let us know what

724
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,000
gear you're using and just play some. Just fucking riff away. Let's see if we can do that

725
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,760
because I like listening to guitar solo. For a while we did drum cadences and then I guess

726
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,040
we just kind of ran out of material after a while. But guitar solo as man, you can pick up your

727
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,040
right. In fact, I have, I got four guitars here. I love Christina's boyfriend Andy. He

728
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:41,600
re-strong every single guitar, cleaned them all up, tuned them all. Nothing I can play or anything.

729
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,480
Hey Adam, this is Stella from California. I just wanted to tell you that I truly enjoyed

730
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:56,560
the show with you and Patricia. It's just so wonderful listening to both of you, the honesty

731
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:04,320
and sincerity. It's not corny to me because I've been married for almost 25 years and for you being

732
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:14,720
together 20 years and still being so in love and such kinder spirits. So thank you and hopefully

733
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,720
Patricia will be back again next week or maybe not next week because she'll be in San Francisco.

734
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:34,160
But anyway, have a wonderful day and just a day. Just beg, I want you to be be gay with my wife.

735
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:41,680
I would make me really happy. John Kits says, Adam, be a little gay. Make sure the kids are quiet.

736
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,800
Ah, those were the days when men were the master of the manner. Is Ivan still available?

737
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:53,440
I think Patricia's sister. I'm telling you, man. Actually, I did listen to the show I

738
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:01,440
did with Patricia Valentine's Day. Man, I'm a lucky mother fucker. Vadim Zaliva.

739
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,400
He, now I'm just going to switch gears here for a second to a little bit of tin foil hat moment

740
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,480
back to the Nokia N800. Not just the Nokia. I was talking about the light. That's what it was.

741
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:23,120
The life blog software that is in the series 60 phones. I had that on. Oh, I have it. I have it on my E61 and

742
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,080
was it the N95 or whatever. A lot of phones have this. It's a really nice piece of software.

743
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,480
Well, second. What's that? Screw up. It's like the Dutch gossip magazines are calling me now. How

744
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:46,240
they got my number? I don't know. Anyway, so I had a story earlier in the week. I was talking about

745
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,520
the fact that they support the Atom ATOM, the Atom API, which is a way to get content to metadata

746
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,680
from one device to another across the internet. And I was saying basically the MetaWeblog API,

747
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:07,360
which is built on top of XMLRPC, or is an XMLRPC version. I don't know what the hell you call it.

748
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,440
But you know what I'm talking about, which is really so simple. Even I can make it work. I even

749
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:18,880
made it work on the N800. And I really want Nokia to implement an Atom on XMLRPC with a MetaWeblog

750
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:26,640
API, which so far I've been striking out on. So Vadim sends in a comment, which I thought was really

751
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,960
interesting. He says, uh, heard your comments about Atom versus XMLRPC in the Nokia Life blog.

752
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,440
He says, I assume by XMLRPC, you mean the MetaWeblog protocol? Oops. Yes.

753
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,640
Working in mobile space, I can understand why Nokia is reluctant to do what you want. It's very

754
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,160
difficult to get new software into headsets. Fuck. I'm going to play that voicemail, whoever that was.

755
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,880
It requires extensive testing of multiple devices for where upgrade sometimes even legal

756
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,440
paperwork in some countries. Yeah, I that I understand, but that was not what I was told. I was told,

757
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,840
hey, we've got the Atom API. Why would I implement something else? On the other hand, it would be

758
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,920
quite simple as Vadim to implement simple proxy from Atom posting the Life blog flavor because

759
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:13,040
they do use some non-standard extensions to the MetaWeblog. This could be an external module running

760
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,640
on separate machines. This way, you didn't do not need to modify anything at Podshow,

761
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,800
and yet have it working with Nokia phones. It's a fairly simple project. Probably only take a

762
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:27,840
couple of days. And I'm very interested in this. Think about, I mean, what a what a fantastic

763
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,960
web service that would be. Wow. Okay, here's an idea for your Vadim. Here's an idea.

764
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:43,840
So if you made a simple web service, basically where I sign in, I register and I say, okay,

765
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:51,120
I'm going to be sending you something from my Nokia phone or any Atom related protocol.

766
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,960
But let's just say the Life blog. And here's where I want it to go in XMLRPC. So you have kind of

767
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,320
like a translator. You know what? I would even be happy to have a little link at the bottom show

768
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:11,440
of Automatically that says, you know, this post was TransMorgaford TransFarded. This post was

769
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,520
TransFarded. Thanks to the Vadim translator service or something like that. I think there's a

770
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,480
fuck, I pay for it. You know what? That's awesome. Awesome Vadim. Let's see if we can get some

771
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,200
together on that man. I really like it. Okay. So let me just see here. These these jibronies, man.

772
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,320
They've been calling me for the past two days. What they call up and they say, hi, we just want to

773
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,160
see how everything's going and how's your new house? Let me say, I'm going to put this on the

774
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,160
speaker phone. I recognize the number immediately as show news, a television rag.

775
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,240
Do you want to be eating? You're a message from Anna?

776
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,840
Uh, why do I have to listen to that? Hold on a second. I don't want to listen to that. That's

777
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,240
like really old messages. Oh, I hate it when singular does this. Hold on. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

778
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,040
save. Oh, this sucks so bad.

779
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,360
A crap. All right. Let's play some Jersey Todd and then I'll get this hold on a second.

780
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,520
You know, I know you're with me now anyway. Hey, yeah, hold on. Let me save that one.

781
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,120
Hold on. It's like a fucking million years old.

782
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,200
Oh, singular. Can I just say that your voice mail service sucks major ass. You should be

783
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,960
giving me the new messages first, not the old messages. Hold on. Yeah,

784
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,160
re-saved. Okay. Finally.

785
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,680
Okay. Well, that was really fucking unsuccessful. Hold on.

786
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:16,720
Okay. Those of you who live in the Netherlands will understand how stupid that is. Hey, just call

787
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,720
the see how you're doing. See if, hey, why don't you call in live on the show tonight?

788
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,720
Whenever there's technical problems, I'm just really happy he's nearby.

789
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:43,840
I had a prolific program. I'm proud of you, man. You're learning. You're correcting yourself.

790
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,760
You're taking your time to speak. Let's go. I had a prolific program in San Francisco again.

791
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,720
Take your time. I posted some of the Google Earth output that you requested on the news group

792
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,480
on my blog as I put in keyhole mark of using Python. Have a good night, cheers. Okay.

793
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,040
So prolific programmer is on the case. What are we talking about? Well, we're talking about

794
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,320
ramping up for free Trinity. That love day for you, everybody. Let's see if we can get this some

795
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,600
bitch on the road.

796
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:24,000
Driving across the USA. Open and make a good time today. I feel like I've been watching

797
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,520
go. Letting everybody know that this is going to be the better way.

798
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:37,280
Little cowbell, everybody. The Trinity, Trinity, because of central luxury, Trinity, Trinity,

799
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:43,840
left the bio, diesel, set your brain, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity,

800
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,680
right out. Okay. I got a lot of work to do this week and catching up on the free Trinity

801
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:56,960
group. I've got a proposal that I have to still review from Paula Walto, podcaster, Barbara, who's

802
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,440
gathering all the information I want to run the project. I've got to kind of figure out what

803
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:10,320
the entire project is. However, the techno heads are surging ahead and I really, I just haven't

804
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,600
had time to sit down and parse through it, but it looks like we got a lot of code that I'm going

805
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,200
to start to implement this weekend. So prolific programmers, he just heard he's set something up now

806
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,520
so that GPS coordinates are output in a KML file, which is the type of file Google Earth uses,

807
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:36,240
so you should be able to track Trinity's progress. Okay. I've been thinking about

808
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,680
thinking about where to place the black box, which I'm pretty sure is going to be a Nokia

809
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,360
and 800. That seems to be our development platform. I'm thinking that it wouldn't be cool

810
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,840
if we use the onboard camera and we kind of position the thing on the dashboard, so you can always see

811
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:07,360
who is driving and then I saw something yesterday on Dave Winner's weblog. You have these wireless

812
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:13,760
cameras, these Wi-Fi-based cameras, that as long as they can connect to a Wi-Fi point somewhere,

813
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,440
they basically send back their IP information to home-based and you can not only look at the

814
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,600
picture, but you can control them from anywhere in the world. Maybe it makes sense to have a couple

815
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:32,080
of these hardwired in as well, so you can either, so we could perhaps record a video stream,

816
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,240
make it interactive. I got to get one at my hand, I wanted these devices, I got to order one off

817
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,000
of Amazon, but that could be something very cool as well. A multimedia experience with Trinity.

818
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,840
Okay Adam, after listening to the DSC for over 350 shows, I'm finally sending in an audio

819
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,120
comment. My name is Dan Lin and I produce the RoseDrop Media Circus podcast available at

820
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,800
RoseDropMedia.podshow.com. Our show features local Portland Oregon Performing Artist,

821
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,360
answering interview questions, playing live, and sometimes featuring cuts from their CDs.

822
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,960
We've been doing the show since September 2005 and have posted over 100 shows of all original

823
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,640
material. We just moved from our first venue, have always recorded our show live in public,

824
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,000
and would love to have Trinity stop by on her cross-country tour. Join the circus,

825
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,440
and we'll take you out to a nearby biodiesel station. We also stream our live taping into

826
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,440
second life. I've played many live music dates in SL as RoseDrop Rust, and we can show the

827
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,240
audience in real life clubs, the second life podshow live music venue. Please come to Portland

828
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,320
to be our guest. This would be a wonderful and valuable prize for our listeners.

829
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,360
Haven't missed a show since I started listening, and yes, I told all the staff, of course.

830
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,320
All right, dude, thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely. We'll put her on the map, and that would

831
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,560
make a lot of sense. I don't mind going up or down before we go to the right. If you're looking

832
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,840
at Trinity's starting point, lots of other smart companies jumping in on the action because

833
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,200
it's going to be a lot of fun to be had with Trinity. Hi, Adam. It is all the same on from Holland.

834
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,800
Well, I listen to the daily source because only almost on the regularly basis daily. I love

835
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:26,320
the show. I even love the Trinity concept. In my daytime job, I'm a marketing guy at the company

836
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,960
Vogels. We made a product to mount these these player or small 70C in your car at the head

837
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:40,480
of Phonti. For the back seat, I can just enjoy a movie or show the web. I'm willing to

838
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,120
sponsor the project with a VV doc product. And while we're even a couple, if you want to

839
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:55,040
give them a chance, I would put the values of prices. The product is on www.Vosal.com, slash VV doc,

840
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,440
and I will send you an email with my contact details if you want to know more about the

841
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:17,200
VV doc. Okay, it actually straps on to the back of the headrest. That's pretty interesting.

842
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,000
You have other docs here available as well. Let me see, when else they have. They have sound on

843
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,160
their website is what they have. LCD wall support. Dude, thank you. That might be pretty good.

844
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:38,320
Yeah. I wonder if you can still bolt the box to that. I don't want, well, it's kind of a

845
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,480
trusting. If we send Trinity off and we have this box, this nice tablet, it's something that

846
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,680
could be easily stolen. If you take it out of the car, it could be easily dropped. We may have

847
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:58,480
to have a little more a fixed solution for that than what it was called, DV doc does. I like the

848
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,640
product though. Is that your own invention? Is that a Dutch product because it's pretty cool?

849
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,920
Alright, please join the Free Trinity Google Group. I predict that somewhere in the next,

850
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,040
well, I'd have to say by maybe April 1st, but hopefully before that, we can get around the road.

851
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,240
It really depends on how much the technology we can get together, but I feel we're getting pretty close.

852
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,280
I just got a jump into the group and start participating and maybe help organize a little bit

853
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,640
and see if we can get some installs and stuff just kind of works.

854
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:41,520
The address to join is groups.google.com slash group free Trinity Trinity Trinity,

855
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:50,560
luxury Trinity Trinity, let the bio diesel set your brain, Trinity Trinity, Trinity Trinity,

856
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,400
free Trinity, you save the world, you win valuable prizes. Trinity.

857
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:06,560
Hey Adam, it's Kate from the UK again. You were just lamenting on DSC 545, I think,

858
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,320
but no women were calling you, so I'm calling you again, and you were also talking about smart

859
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:18,400
hot women, so I thought you might want to try me out for sites, I'd say, on five to seven,

860
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,120
reasonably slim and blond, I've got blue eyes and I've got a HD in biomedical science.

861
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,440
Is that the, yeah? Oh yes, that does mean, that's all I've got to say,

862
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,480
this is what you have to go on times day, and oh yeah, I think I've caught your illness through my

863
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,400
earbuds, I feel horrible, I don't even need a pot saw that. Oh no, can I come over there and kiss

864
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,360
it and make it better without help? What do you have a degree in? Yeah, and I think that's all

865
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,080
I've got to say, and then to which one? Why, why not stay in biomedical science. Biomedical science.

866
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,520
You know, just the other day, it's, it's really unbelievable. Ron Blumini, we're saying to each other,

867
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,960
wouldn't it be fucking awesome if we could have a video show about biomedical science and

868
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,400
we're looking for a host, I mean, I just can't find one anywhere.

869
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,920
Suddenly naked pictures, paint, I'll set them back up from us, crack it up,

870
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:26,880
charging in the house, to make a motion, to watch this bother our hearts,

871
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:37,360
to turn his ball around.

872
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:56,720
Hey, how are you doing? It's Jersey Todd on Fubar Friday. Yo, what's up, AC? I've got a band for you tonight.

873
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:04,160
Hailing out at New York, New York, the city's so nice and named it twice is one of my new favorite

874
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,360
bands. Yeah, they kind of sound like a cross between the strokes and Freddie Mercury, but I'm

875
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,040
loving them because they just sound like something completely unique. The band, well, of course I love

876
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:21,120
the name, the band is the attorneys and the song is on a whim. Hey, have a good food by Friday.

877
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:31,120
Everybody, I'll check you next week. Turn this up loud.

878
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:01,040
Got a good back, good back to you. I know it's been a long time, but I don't know what to do,

879
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:08,160
but my time and my mind is a fantasy. I know it's just a dream girl, but it feels so real to me.

880
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:20,720
I know we'll have to relax the reason to be fun telling you not to fear stress of our worries.

881
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,680
I'll be ready to show you, I know we'll have fun.

882
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,280
Checking my watch it's nine o'clock, I know I'll take on too long

883
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,040
But it's not like I've forgotten

884
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,560
What you'll need and the same did we like to share I know it's not the same dear

885
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,660
But at least we both were here

886
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,040
Oh no, wait

887
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,880
I've got back to relax and be by the bed

888
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,880
Do it side to just face

889
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,880
Oh my work please

890
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,480
And I'm too new, so I'm not

891
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,760
I'll come soon by too

892
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,760
And all I'll be saying once is that please remember my answer

893
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,760
Only once will the set of you say

894
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,760
And I love you more than a doubt tells us questions

895
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,760
So stay with me just one more night as my name

896
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:44,760
I finally home now the work is done

897
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,760
I know it's been a long time since you and I had any fun

898
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,760
Together we measure just what love could mean

899
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,760
I'm in love with you

900
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,760
I'm in love with you

901
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,760
I'm in love with you

902
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,760
I'm in love with you

903
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,760
I'm in love with you

904
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,760
I just would love could mean

905
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,760
I know I want you to know me

906
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,760
For the rest of what may be

907
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,760
I'm in love with you

908
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,760
I come back to relax

909
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,760
Bring the lips of your face

910
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,760
Oh my worries

911
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,760
I'llyeon to you

912
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,760
I'm in love with you

913
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,760
I'll come straight back

914
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,760
To you

915
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:08,760
Once again Jersey Todd delivers the goods the attorneys on a win from the pod save music network

916
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:15,760
Through the magic of the internet to your ear buds via the pod safe music network links

917
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,360
In the show notes a daily source code dot car. It's Friday

918
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:28,360
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday food about Friday at a final fun of the week

919
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:33,360
I'll have no one of these in a while until we've almost had a complete week of shows and I'm feeling a little bit better

920
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,360
I did just want to say one thing about what I learned in this past week my final bot for you

921
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:47,360
I learned yesterday that a husband of a woman that Patricia and I know pretty well well acquainted with has cancer

922
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:52,360
And his terminal has one year to live and he's very young she's young

923
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,360
It's something that is just fucking shocking

924
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,360
And of course I've been confronted with this on my own personal level as well

925
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,360
You know this past week we celebrated Valentine's Day and it's the one day out of the year

926
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:09,360
That guaranteed we're going to be nice and romantic and send flowers and make love

927
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:14,360
And just you know have a nice overly commercialized day

928
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:21,360
And when I hear you know how very vulnerable life is I just think to myself you know

929
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,360
Why don't you get up every day and think today is Valentine's Day

930
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,360
Fuck the fact that your eyes are opening in the morning you should just be grateful for that

931
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,360
Really

932
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,360
So here's my suggestion

933
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:39,360
Run don't walk run to your iTunes or your Napster or your whatever Yahoo music service

934
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,360
Buy some berry white and tonight

935
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,360
When you and your loved one are together just flip that one on

936
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:54,360
Of course you'll have to slap the laptop into the bedroom because the iPod or unless have an iPod dog

937
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,360
Anyway, play that and

938
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,360
Let's make every day just a little bit of Valentine's Day

939
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,360
All right, that's it for this week traveling to San Francisco

940
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,360
I'll probably do a show Monday, even though it's President's Day

941
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,360
If you guys promise you'll listen I'll do a show

942
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:26,360
And today's show notes will be chock full with all kinds of links and stuff as discussed in this very program

943
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:31,360
As daily source code dot com and if you want to send me anything it's Adam at podshow dot com

944
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,360
Have yourselves a great weekend

945
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,360
Make love to very white

946
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,360
Take care everybody

947
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,360
Have another podshow podcast

948
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,360
Stick it in your ear
