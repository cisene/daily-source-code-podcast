157
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,160

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
I love it.

179
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,000
It just feels so good to do these mashups under the auspices of education, of course.

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,440
As we continue on our football Friday, I've been talking about this for about two

181
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
weeks.

182
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,320
Now, finally, it's, it is upon us.

183
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,640
The launch of the official podshow.com, suckless zone.

184
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:22,040
It's at suckless.podshow.com, so that's suckless with the hell I'll spell it for you.

185
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,560
Sierra Uniform, Charlie Kilo, Lima, Echo, Sierra, Sierra.podshow.com.

186
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,160
There's a little video there that part of this will be very familiar to listeners of

187
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
the Daily Source Code home.

188
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,920
It's not going to actually going to open this up directly from suckless.podshow.com.

189
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,480
Let's see if it'll play properly.

190
00:09:41,480 --> 00:10:10,720
We're always trying to improve, and this time we need you to help us suck, what?

191
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:23,880
We're creating a special place called podshow suckless zone at suckless.podshow.com.

192
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,360
All right, well once you're there, you can join the super panel, give us your feedback.

193
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,800
Earn points and get valuable stuff.

194
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
It's fun.

195
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
It's easy and best of all.

196
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,440
You help us suck less.

197
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,040
Not to imply we suck to begin with.

198
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:56,760
Yeah, soccer girl is in this promo, forget it, don't even do anything at the suckless

199
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
zone.

200
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,200
Just look at soccer girl, and then you'll want to do anything we ask you to.

201
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
That's pretty cool.

202
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,880
Of course, I'll put the link in the show notes, but it's pretty easy to remember.

203
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,960
Help us suck less.podshow.

204
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,960
You're outer, I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

205
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,760
You're outer, please don't bang that gavel.

206
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,240
You can try this cowbell out, let's all give a nod.

207
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,960
To the hardest work in law here, it's just a tiny bag, yeah.

208
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,400
It's just a tiny bag, yeah.

209
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,240
You're outer, what do you say?

210
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,400
You might even get the veld one in this case.

211
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,400
It's very easy to suck, yeah, yeah.

212
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,400
It's very easy to suck.

213
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,040
Yeah, how's it going at him?

214
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,440
It's jersey time, the official music college is all of the chacha.

215
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Dude, everyone's in the wild.

216
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,440
There's an album that comes up on the pot safe music network that I absolutely get addicted

217
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
to.

218
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,760
And that's happening again this week.

219
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
The singer is Emerson Hart.

220
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,280
Now, the name Emerson Hart should ring a belt to some people because, well, he is the former

221
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,520
lead singer of the band, Tonic.

222
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,680
In 2003, they had two Grammy nominations at a number one hit, they had a platinum album.

223
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,880
Yeah, they were a huge band, well Emerson Hart is now in the pot safe music network.

224
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,680
He's got a brand new album called Cigarettes and Gasoline, which is just absolutely fantastic.

225
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,800
The song that I'm going to play for you, if you're going to leave, it's just I love

226
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
the slow build to it.

227
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,480
It's just a fantastic, fantastic song.

228
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,120
And the best thing that I can say about Emerson Hart is, of course, he's a jersey guy.

229
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Check this out.

230
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,240
It's Emerson Hart on the pot safe music network, on the Fubore Friday.

231
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,960
Check this out.

232
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:58,320
Maybe I'm the Joker, maybe I'm the fool in your eyes, maybe I'm the weak one, maybe

233
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:07,440
I'm a lion just cause, maybe I'm angry, cause I'm the one who's always wrong, and

234
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:19,560
maybe I'm not the one who's so strong, did you think about it, did you put it in the

235
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:27,960
wallet out, could you live without me, did you ever really have a doubt, but do you

236
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:37,120
want to stand it baby, when you say it's over and start, maybe I'm not the one who

237
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:52,120
says it's over and start, maybe I'm not the one who's so strong, I'm the one who's so strong,

238
00:13:52,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I'm the one who's so strong, I'm the one who's so strong, I'm the one who's so strong,

239
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,760
I'm the one who's so strong, I'm the one who's so strong, I'm the one who's so strong,

240
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:22,720
we can fight about all the things, this isn't forever, this is small that I'm ready,

241
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:35,720
but do you want to stand it baby, when you say it's over and start, maybe I'm not the one who's

242
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:50,720
so strong, I'm the one who's so strong, I'm the one who's so strong, I'm the one who's so strong, I'm the one who's so strong,

243
00:14:50,720 --> 00:15:06,720
yeah, you better start around, because I always do, no more time, oh, did happen,

244
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:19,720
the things that you wanted, we in the front, how did happen, yeah,

245
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:42,720
just look all right baby, someday you might need a friend, so if you're gonna leave,

246
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:55,720
yeah, you better get going, cause I ain't always in no more time, that we did, what we did is it would be calling,

247
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:04,720
yeah, you better start around, cause I ain't always in no more time,

248
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:18,720
it might ain't always in no more time, one might have been, all right according to Jersey Todd,

249
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,720
he is from the Garden State currently living in California, Emerson Hart on the daily source code,

250
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,720
the Fubar Friday edition, we invite you to kick back relax and enjoy the maximum music and call in once in a while,

251
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:50,720
I don't understand, I know you don't make an arrangement from the car, but it really is the only place that I can contact,

252
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,720
yeah, in my schedule at the moment, stop it small and absolutely fantastic, makes one really,

253
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:11,720
I'm a small guy, I was small and 40 days for about 15, 15 years, and my little boy came along and I decided to sing that I gave up,

254
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,720
what made you this heart, it was so awful.

255
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Well, you know what, this is James is talking about, that I stopped smoking at what 48 hours ago,

256
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:32,720
and I gotta tell you, James, the physical addiction is really not a problem for me, it's the self-medicating factor,

257
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,720
but that I really, really miss, particularly when you have scheduled stuff you gotta do, like, you know,

258
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,720
doing the show, so you do the show, you want to be in a certain mood, and I kind of miss that, I don't drink,

259
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:53,720
so a lot of people do something like that with alcohol, but the only time that I've really missed smoking in the past two days is when I'm doing this show,

260
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:01,720
and otherwise, not at all, in fact, I'm enjoying kind of feeling awake, it's a boy, open still fun to listen to.

261
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:11,720
And for you know, it is, there will not be any gestures you know about it, but it's just trying to help people for this new smoking band coming in on the first July of 15 July, or it is.

262
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Although it would be, you know, you know, you know, you're, you know, you're, you know, you're, you're, you know, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

263
00:18:41,720 --> 00:19:11,720
you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you are, you're. You're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, and you're, you're,

264
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,240
And I watched that and she was a smoker, and you know, I'll tell you what the problem was of course

265
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,600
Yeah, I should have quit immediately and having seen my mom go through that horrible fucked-up process

266
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Just inhumane

267
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,240
She had only quit smoking a year and a half or maybe yeah a little under two years before that

268
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,120
I think I was actually afraid to quit thinking that that's the moment I'd get lung cancer

269
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
I may have it. I don't know

270
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,000
But I if yeah, I told you I got I got the the warnings from the angels

271
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,000
So I guess I got to take that seriously. I really really will

272
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,280
I do not intend to go back to smoking tobacco and again

273
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,040
I can't smoke anything during the day if it's pure stuff because I just turn into a

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,880
yeah man I'll come jog with you because it's fun. We jog right across the apron right

313
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,560
of the runway. We'll be dodging a numerous vehicles as they are incoming. Hopefully

314
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,360
crap. I won't be flying for another week or so sure and as I look out the window no one

315
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,480
may be flying this country for another week or so.

316
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,480
Hey.

317
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,680
Do you smell that? Fucking smells like we didn't hear.

318
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:50,160
Straight from the streets and to the limousine started off with just his bullet holes

319
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:57,160
in a big dream hooked up with them and them and Dr. Dre. Now he's got his own fucking video game.

320
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:12,000
What you trying to say what you trying to say what you trying to say 50 cent is a pussy

321
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:33,640
50 cent is a pussy. Yeah bitch what I'm fucking calling you out. You're about as

322
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,800
gangster as the chick from no doubt. You try to step with your gee unicru, my true-to-life

323
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:54,440
woman's a kick this shit out of you. What you trying to say, what you trying to say 50 cent

324
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:02,400
is a pussy. I don't give a fuck about your gangster party. 50 cent is a pussy. You should

325
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:18,320
quit without a bappa party. You got shot nine times. You got shot nine times. You better

326
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:26,760
you're not a dumb bitch. You got shot nine times. Some dumb motherfucker can't shoot a properly.

327
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:43,680
50 cent is a pussy. 50 cent is a pussy. 50 cent is a pussy. 50 cent is a pussy.

328
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:50,680
50 cent is a pussy. And if you want to know who sang that. WWW.

329
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:56,440
That's nice. Peter. What day is it today? It's Friday.

330
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:07,040
It's Friday. It kind of came as a thought in the middle of the week as the messages came

331
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,160
to me that I'm basically been killing myself. So the final thought of the week is just

332
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,640
for my benefit so that I can listen to this show one day in the future thing. Oh yeah,

333
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:23,200
that was kind of a turning point. That was pretty good. Total be yeah. I'm not really

334
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:30,680
grouchy or I'm hungry all the time. I don't know. I guess I'm no one to preach. So there's

335
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,040
nothing we can say about it. But I'm not going to be for myself that I finally figured

336
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:39,160
out that I should at least stop the thing that's really going to kill me to quickest.

337
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:48,040
Oh no, no, not flying. And time to get a hyperbong or something. And really I figured

338
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:55,240
it all out. It's a whole oral fixation. That's really my problem. And I just don't think

339
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,680
it's acceptable if you have an oral fixation to walk around with a cock and a year

340
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:12,960
mouth. That's why I was smoking. I don't punch you. I got to get out of here. DailySourceco.com,
